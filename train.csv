1,same battery problem as others,I have had the exact same experiance with this phone as most of the other reviewers. The only exception that I saw was that I actually did replace the battery and it didn't help. I am looking for a new phone now to replace it. Buyer beware.
1,Not the same,"Wife is saying that the product is not the same since they changed the packaging and ingredients. She has extremely curly hair and is complaining that it ""doesn't hold the way it used to"""
2,Not bad for the price,Works great and sounds good. If anyone needs an external card like me who doesn't have an extra pci slot to spare this is definately the way to go.
1,Defective,I opened up the package and one of the rings fell out. After looking at the tarp I found that one of the rings was ripped off. Poor quality control.I now wish I had opened the package sooner so that I could have gotten a replacement for it. My own fault obviously (Lesson learned).I do not think I would buy another one from this maker.I took a spare rope and ran it through all the remaining rings and am using it to cover my log rack. Now I just need to find a higher quality one to replace what this one was to be used for.
1,arbogast weedless jitterbug,I too ordered the weedless jitterbug pictured here... I too was sent the WRONG item... the item sent was NOT a weedless jitterbug... it was a muskie size jitterbug with treble hooks on the side and a treble hook on the back... nothing weedless about it at all... I would recommend you NOT buy it unless you want the muskie size regular jitterbug...because that is what you'll get
2,Above All Others,"John Williams, David Russell, Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, et. al. all owe a great deal to this now departed giant. If you own ANY classical guitar recordings, you should purchase this collection. It's not only the finest remastering available, but an equisitely fine selection of Segovia's contribution to the genre and the art."
2,Works great with Zaurus,"I wanted a CompactFlash Ethernet card for my Sharp Zaurus (the SL-5500), and this was the cheapest one I could find. It wasn't listed on Sharp's compatibility list, but I saw someone online had mentioned that it had worked for them, so I gave it a try. Plugged it in, configured it in Network & Sync, and it worked right away. (This isn't actually surprising, of course; CompactFlash is just miniaturized PCMCIA, and Linux has great PCMCIA Ethernet support.) Makes a huge difference in installing software; I can use the ""Install from Network"" button in ""Add/Remove Software"" to download from package feeds, or use the browser to download package files that aren't available in feeds.This is with version 2.0.37 of the Zaurus ROM, the one that came preinstalled.Now if only I can convince my wife to let me put an Ethernet drop in the bedroom. :-)"
1,"Greek music is excellent. The ""other"" is very ordinary","I ordered this album for its excellent original greek music.Unfortunately, de rest of the music (ordinary film music) is not worth a cent."
1,worst article descriptions,forget about it. the descriptions of the articles are so hopeless that subscribing is futile. i am going to give up on the free trial.
1,"Sedaris is Great, But Definitely NOT UNABRIDGED","Let me explain my rating. For Sedaris' work, 5 stars plus. My problem is with Amazon listing this as ""Unabridged"". It is not--it is significantly abridged. What is here is great, as you might expect, but some of my favorites are missing (such as ""We Get Along"" from Barrel Fever). Funny thing is, nowhere on the item itself does the word ""unabridged"" appear. Why then does Amazon list it as ""unabridged""? Not good--makes me wonder about their other descriptions. Buy it if you love Sedaris, but don't expect everything to be on these recordings."
1,"Looks good, relatively comfortable, but flimsy","The first thing I noticed about this helmet was its cheap construction. The plastic shell feels flimsy and plastic trim pieces feel like they could very easily be ripped off. The construction is not solid enough to inspire much confidence in safety. Even for just $80, I feel like I've been ripped off."
2,STUDENTS: BEWARE THE ANNOTATED INSTRUCTOR'S VERSION,"This regular version is the one you want.The instructor's version can actually be bought for much cheaper (but is not at all appropriate for the student), and it appears that someone in Salem, OR has bought a huge load of the instructor's version and is NOT making it clear that they are NOT the same thing as the student version. Therefore, he/she/they are selling them for $36 and up and making it look like that's a deal when it appears to me you can actually find the instructor's version for $7.99 and up.Make sure to read the fine print. Look carefully for the words ""instructor"" and ""annotated"" and don't by the book unless you are looking for that version...in which case you can get it cheaper elsewhere, anyway. (Do a search her for ""intermediate algebra annotated tobey"" and you will see the lower price ranges on the instructor version.)He/she/they are selling them all over the internet and sending them from Salem, OR."
2,"Funny, sexy, and realistic","When Bull Durham came out, it set the gold standard for baseball movies. The funny thing about it, though, is even if you are not a baseball fan, this is a movie to see. The writing, the direction, and the acting all are top notch in this movie, which is funny and tocuhing. Susan Sarandon is stunning and may have turned in the years best performance as a ""baseball Annie"" with both looks and a brain. Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins are great and the supporting cast is terrific. The DVD is wonderful, with good colors and delightful extras. The commentary with Costner and Robbins is a lot of fun. This is one DVD that will be a great addition to anyone's collection."
1,These are the small gumballs ...,"Be aware these gumballs are the small ones. Half of the machines Amazon has matched to them are for the large gumballs.'TheNewMall' that sells these is aware of this fact, but will not issue a return once you order them.Until Amazon fixes the problem and finds a more honest vendor, be aware of what your getting.At the current price, even if your looking for the small ones, your not getting much for your money."
1,Disappointed,"I have read several of Sharon Shinn's books and found them entertaining. This one was not. I read all the reviews about the great love story the book was; I never found that to be true. The story skated around Gabriel and Rachel constantly with little if any interaction between the two for most of the book. When were together, they fought. I realize there's the popular antagonist views many writers use in romantic novels, yet this was so overused that I liked neither of the characters and could see how they didn't like each other. I particularly did not like Rachel, the main female character."
2,Fantastic Book,"I chose this book from several options for a class. Tovani has insight into what stands in the way of students' reading comprehension and useful strategies for how to prevent ""fake reading"". Best of all, though, Tovani uses examples as 'models' for how to put her strategies into action in a classroom and what response to expect when you do."
2,Great season!,This season had some of the best remembered and fun episodes! The music box drama featuring Laura being forced to turn on her stuttering friend (that Nellie Oleson was such a fun brat!) to Pa mining the liquid dynamite to lil Carrie falling down a well (if only they had left her!). Probably the most famous id the episode dealing with Solomon (Todd Bridges) and his struggle for racial equality. Very much a tear jerker and always good for a self-indulgent catharsis of tears.
2,it rolls,well this is a real great buy for any one deep into trance and cant get enough of it . since this is a 4 cd album its pretty good as you can put it on and relax and let the music take you thru different worlds.
2,Not Happy,"I like all three Black and Decker 18v tools but not the company.I own a; grass hog, chain saw and hedge cutter. I like all three. i wish the grass hog had a little more power but I like its portability; it's a trade off. However two batteries have developed cracks in their casing. I called their customer no-service. I told the rep this was a hazard they turned me over to the supervisor who didn't care a bit. I was told to travel over 60 miles to a service center ""so they could look at it"". I gave them the serial numbers, approx date of purchase no help. Two items were bought on Amazon."
2,A good find. A great buy,"I bought this watch about a year ago and I will admit it was because of Stranger Than Fiction. I was contemplating purchasing a more expensive swiss made watch but I feel this has been a great buy. Very accurate and solid feeling. For about 90 bucks, you can't beat it. My only gripe is the beep is very soft, so don't plan to use this as an alarm. Functional and stylish. You can display 2 time zones on the LCD. You also can turn the LCD display off to use less battery and appear a little more ""formal."""
2,Willie plays blues with a twinkle in his eye,"This album not only sounds good, it feels good. The mood is one of easy contentment, with the songs sounding well-traveled and the lyrics, while true Blues, having just enough humor for a fun, upbeat listen. The solo guitar and keyboard work, of which there's plenty here to savor, is mature and satisfying. Not one note of it sounded like less than the real Blues thing and I'll be keeping this album and listening to it a lot.I'd really rather give it 4 1/2 stars if I could though, because of the inclusion of Susan Tedeschi, who sounds positively amateurish alternating verses with Willie on ""Crazy."" (Of course, I really don't like her singing, so if you do, discount that last point.) A couple of the other guests could maybe have had a little more than one verse to sing too. But B.B. King's appearances here are good and 4 stars wouldn't have done this CD justice."
2,Very good!,Im using this bed rail as a headboard for my dorm room bed so my pillows dont fall off. It works perfectly! It is the perfect size and isn't too high that is seperates the room. I'm glad i got it
1,"Service is fine, product isn't.","It may just be that my belly button is small, but the piercing stuck out waaaay too far. I would only suggest this if you have a deep innie."
1,It doesn't work,"I purchased the product based on the high reviews it had gotten. I followed the instructions to the last letter hoping to be rid of the urine smell. However, after hours of cleaning and to my dismay, I realized that the smell was still very potent and my cat went right back to the spot to urinate. I wasted my money for nothing."
1,cracked and loose lid...,"Although my chinchilla really enjoys his ball--he goes like crazy all over the family room banging into things and chasing our cat. However, because the plastic is weak, the lid fits very loosely and my 'chilla bangs into everything, the lid came off (even with scotch tape reinforcement) and our family room became Wild Kingdom as the 'chilla was loose and our cat was on the chase. Everyone survived the excitement and now the lid gets reinforced with packing tape when he wants to run about. I haven't had much luck finding another design or manufacturer with a better quality product."
1,Horrible Camera,"My daughter received this camera as a gift. Too bad a gift receipt wasn't included, because I definitely would have returned it on Day 1. The camera constantly freezes, drains its batteries, and the screen resolution is of horrible quality, where you can't even tell what the image is. I did not print any pictures, so I cannot speak to that, but please do not buy this camera. You're better off buying a cheap adult digital camera."
2,Great book for any beginning investor,"I really liked this book because it started where it should have--at the beginning. It takes the reader through a good , if somewhat lengthy, history of how capitalism began. It then takes the reader through Wall Street and gives them some basic advice on what to do with their money. This is a great book for high school kids who are starting their first job and need advice on how to manage it (I should know, since I fit that description). Anyone who is interested in investing or even making money should read this book."
1,Disappointingly Bland,"Jody Lynn Nye is a normally talented, wonderful author. Her books are a fun read. This was the exception, and the sequel isn't much better. The book meandered through Dreamland, and seems as if it is a poorly designed take-off of Neverending Story (the movie, not the book). It is confusing, with numerous 'save the day' rescues by Roan and his crew. Stick with other of Ms. Nye's works, and avoid this one!"
1,Moderately entertaining but bad ending,"Started off pretty good with a lot of suspense and kept me wanting to read it, but during the last quarter it just dies. The ending is one of the worst I've ever read, but the fact that during the last quarter of the book you can TELL it's going to be a bad ending just ruins it.Seems like the author just got tired of writing and cut it short by a hundred pages or so as there's never any military or saving of the world like the books description says.The first 3 quarters of the book were good, and it had an interesting concept but I have to give it a 2 because of the sudden ending that left me feeling disapointed."
2,"Nice, just what I wanted",The words of Jesus presented in several formats.... I just wanted to have the red words all in one book and this one suits me just fine!
2,Too cute!,My daughter absolutely loves this book and as someone who got a bunny for my eight birthday it is too cute to watch her look at the pictures.
2,LIGHTS!,I don't use it for gaming but so far (1 month) the performance has been impressive. I like the adjustment for light intemsity. Amazon delivered it quickly and efficiently.
2,What a game!!!!,I just finished this game yesterday. While I was playing the game I was quite scared playing it (as usual). This game is really good. The ending was starting out a little surprising from a guest but overall it was good. I really like the battle game at the end after you finish the game. I would recommend this game to anyone.
2,Good Read.,What's there not to like about Virginia Woolf's writings. She writes well. Her book To the Lighthouse is required college reading. I love all her stories.
1,Very poor quality of sound.,"This SACD is not a product of authentic SACD using DSD recording devise. Theresultant sound quality is not of that of true SACD. The most eminent is thepoor dynamic range. I does not recommend this 'fake' SACD, and genarally warn SACD's that does not guarantee DSD technique at recording sessions* bacause non-authentic SACD making is always at danger of poor sound quality.* Analog tapes as original source is OK. They can be readily converted to DSD source, thereby producing the highest quality of SACD."
1,One more example of erroneous collectivist thinking,"The thrust of this book is that the government doesn't take care of the family unit in America anymore resulting in all of the societal problems that pressure families. On the contrary, the extremely irresponsible manner in which parents are now raising kids has more to do with societies problems than just about any factor. It is all part of the liberal collectivist sophistry that the average, unthinking American buys into so readily. If you hold reason and intellect as important ideals, this one will either give you a good laugh or bring on a bout of anger."
2,Provides the words and experiences of ordinary citizens,"In 1826 Americans remembered and celebrated fifty years of independence with parades and speeches. America's Jubilee uses private diaries, letters, newspapers and publications to reveal the personal lives behind the pageantry and celebrations, and the survivors of the War of Independence. Chapters provide the words and experiences of ordinary citizens."
2,Awesome indulgences.,"This series has all the awesome indulgences you could ever wish for. Blood, sex, fighting, sex, blood, sex, arenas, sex, more blood, more sex, realistic fighting, realistic sex ... and an enticing and exciting storyline to go with it. What more can one ask for? This blows character-driven movies - you know, the ones with stupid people doing stupid things so the storyline writers have something to write about - out of the water. This is EXCITING and it moves as if it has a life of its own."
1,SHOULD BE PRESENTED UNABRIDGED!,TO MUCH IS LEFT OUT IN THE ABRIDGED. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED IN UNABRIDGED. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY PUBLISHERS THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE RIGHTS WILL NOT RELEASE THEM. THAT IS NOT RIGHT TO THOSE OF USE WHO A WAIT THE UNABRIDGED STORY.
1,Don't waste your money,This is the worst workout tape i have ever laid eyes upon. The instructor goes way too fast and doesn't give info on how to do the steps. What he does best is moves his hips as shown in the warm up and cool down. It made me wonder if i was watching an exercise tape or a porno. The only person who benefits from the tape is M.C. Cash. His dancers are tired out and the viewer is too confused to actually do anything but watch them. This video is not worth 2.00. I beg you please do not waste your money on this sorry excuse of a workout video.
2,Good Switch with circut breaker attached,Needed a headlite switch for a buggy project and this one worked great. Nice to have the circut protection already mounted.
1,Wrong item!,"I was sent the wrong item. Unfortunately, the merchant didn't have the charger on the picture and my phones remain dead."
2,"BUY this book, early","I found this book quite by accident while looking for something to read at Borders. I was diagnosed as bipolar about a year ago. But in the previous two yearsfore diagnosis, I wrecked my marriage, my finances, was suicidal, and almost bankrupted my company. With medication, good support around me, i am doing much better. Most bipolar people do not think anything is wrong, only that people around them are distressed. My advantage (disadvantage) is that my Dad also developed the disease at midlife and so I know i have the same thing, and that all things i do or say do not always make sense.I honestly believe that having this book earlier in my condition and having a spouse who used the techniques described, would have saved my marriage and finances."
2,Anti-American?,"How is this Anti-American? You numbskull? Bindly following a corrupt government that is lying to you is anti American. This is the most American movie I've seen in years, its an absolute shame on our corporate controlled media that the topics this film covers are even controversial! 20 years ago, this would have been on 60 minutes. Today anyone in the media who questions our government is CANNED. How American is that? They had to fight, and band independant studios together even to get this movie on the screen! Wake up. America is being stolen from the good people who fought and died to create and defend it, by unscrupulous scum like Bush. Its time to wake up to that. If you love America, you cant turn your back on that."
2,Uplifting music with a positive message,"Its so nice to have music with a ""great beat"" to it, and that is both positive & uplifting! My kids even think it's cool to listen to!"
2,The absolute best product,My daughter stop sucking her thumb the moment I put it on and she would ask to paint her nails everyday so I would say it worked in an instant with only a minimum of discomfort she had completely stopped with compaining and all in 3 days. I have since stopped using the product and she has not started the habit back up again. I would recommend thus product 20 times over to any and everyone.
1,POS locks,"I have had two of these for the last 4 years. One failed almost immediately, but Kwikset sent me replacement keypad and I had to pay a lock smith again to install it. Now the other lock failed on me. The motor that turns the bolt wont work. Kwikset wont help me and cant even manage to figure out the problem.My Master Locksmith said these are a P.O.S. and to buy the Schlage keylees as it doesnt have a motor to fail.I would give these ""0"" Stars but it wont allow me."
2,"don't listen to these competitor's reviews, it's terrific!","This is a fantastic mouse. no problems with the battery door at all, I think it's very solid and well designed considering the tiny size of the mouse. It's comfy to hold, nice finish. Buttons are great feeling, as is the wheel. I like the on-off switch, wish my Logitech wireless mouse for my home pc had this feature.Only negative is that the wheel moves more than one ""wheel click amount"" for each physcial click, so it scrolls faster and less consistently than it is supposed to. However that's the smallest problem, and only problem I can find.I'm very happy with this purchase. Nice little carrying pouch as well, and a nice usb extension if needed."
1,Definitely wouldn't buy it again,"I ended up not even using this calendar. The drawings and information felt like it came from a textbook in 1970. It looked like something my mom would've used as a teenager. Besides that, it just came with some useful, but unnecessary stickers. Wouldn't buy it again."
2,Husband loved this.,"Again, Rainbow Bibles are a little difficult to find but my husband was very pleased with the quality and Amazon came through for me again."
2,Owned it for several months.,"I've owned it for several months. Although it is made in China, so far so good. I did buy an extended warranty from SquareTrade though because I don't want to pay for shipping even during the standard warranty period.It occupies a lot of space, but it think it is worth it. Of course it is not suitable for a small room such as an office or a bedroom, unless such a room is more than 12' x 12'.I am not a connoisseur of subwoofers, but it seems to me that this one produces somewhat softer sound which is good for movies but perhaps will not excite you if are buying it primarily for heavy metal, but of course, it is a subjective perception."
1,To Follow Michael Acuna's Review Is One Big Challenge!,"Although I totally disagree with his descriptive adjectives over earlier, Michael Caine...that Jude Law's version of Alfie is all three: ""watered-down, scrubbed and sanitized"" gigolo/playboy in relating to healthy Lassies, Sienna, Marisa & Susan, it appears to me that each one used him in widely divergent ways!I cannot agree with any reviewer that Jude Law remotely fulfills his ""sanitized, scrubbed, watered-down"" idea of this obsessive, compulsive character; Even with an over-healthy, wealthy, Susan Sarandon! In fact, his escapades left me unimpressed, under-sea, at-odds with Director Shyer's Movie! Enough...an older retired, Chaplain Fred W Hood"
2,My 1st Cookbook,My mom got me this cookbook when I first moved out into my own apartment. I had no idea how to learn to cook for myself- Taco Bell and Wendy's were the equivilant of a hot meal. I couldn't believe how easy these recipes were to follow! This book saved my life (and my figure!) and I would recommend it to any first time cook.
2,"Monster, Kody Scott",This book gives great insight to what it was to been a young man growing up in the gangs of LA. This book has made me so thankful that I did not grow up in LA during those times. Young men were put in terrible situations in which tough decisions had to be made. Hopefully many will learn and choose a better life. Life without daily shooting and death.
2,Adorable!,"I bought this phone for myself because I love Hello Kitty. I figure, I'll hand it down to my daughters (maybe..lol) when they are old enough. This phone has caller Id and the wings light up when it rings. It is very well made."
1,IOGear USB Hard Drive,Problem with this drive. It does not work with a standard USB cable included. Must have a Y cable that was sent to me after several calls to IOGear's tech support. It took a return and 30 days to get this product to work. After that it is working fine! Good luck!John...
1,Disappointed,"The pacing is uneven. I'm sorry to say that the reliance on co-authors to do so much of the work for Patterson is causing his books to suffer.Although I appreciate the use of San Francisco for the locale, the geographic inaccuracies are jarring. Frankly, the research is sloppy and I wonder if the co-authors have even been to San Francisco. Lindsay Boxer meets Yuko and Keiko in front of Union Square, but by no means is this ""out by the Golden Gate Panhandle."" In another section, the Hotel Triton can't be fronting Union Square steps away from the cable car line and also be across the street from Chinatown. Sloppy, very sloppy. Reading this is like watching Dustin Hoffman drive on the Bay Bridge the wrong way in The Graduate on his way to Berkeley."
2,Washington Irving meets George Washington,"This book is tedious. But it's tedious to read because of the eloquence and artistic value of Irving's pen. He writes like we don't speak any more, but the material is beautiful to read, and the substance of which he writes is eye-opening. I never realized what Washington had to deal with as he started his assignment to lead in the Revolutionary War. Hair-raising stuff. And written so beautifully."
1,On What Grounds,Not one of my favorite mysteries. Appears that the author is attempting to imitate the Laura Childs' tea shop series and has fallen short.
1,Worst textbook that I have ever had in my College life,"This book is the worst book that my professor has ever chose for my math class. The definitions and theorems in this book has lack of explanations, and there are very few examples. But also the solutions of the examples doesn't make sense at all(especially on chapter 3). I want to tell my professor not to get this book for students in future. I really hate this book."
1,New Age story telling,"I expected this book to be about what people felt were supernatural interventions in their lives for safety, etc., but it turned out to be more New Age philosophy."
2,Different but good!,"A really different show that will rock your world with its twisty storyline and great editing. I didn't expect much when I bought this but I like scary stuff. It proved to be so much more than just another ""horror"" story."
2,A great CD.,"First of all, I just read a review of this on this site that said ""Manson is so obviously gay, just look at the cover"" oh well gee what kind of, (I can't say anything bad here can I) piece of trash are you. He's into gay, and if he were why would it matter. Nor does he worship Satan, just becasue he hates Christianity does NOT NOT NOT mean that he worships Satan. Now onto the music, I think this is one of his best albums. I don't blame him for going more pop, and changing himself considering he had a nervous breakdown after the making of Antichrist Superstar. One would think that The Dope Show and I don't Like The drugs are the best songs since they are th single, but I don't think so. Buy the album and you won't be sorry, maybe he isn't being to to true to his real goth obbsessed fans but like I said if he kept going in the direction he was he'd be dead by now probably."
1,worst office product I've ever wasted my money on,"This product is so bad it really doesn't rate the one star I gave it.BIC Wite-Out Correction Tape, 2 TapesI bought multiple boxes of this product because it was at a good price. Not a single one of the dispensers lasted. The takeup reel does not function at all, so you are stuck with having to deal with it hanging from the dispenser. The white out doesn't stick half the time, so you have to keep reeling out more and more.In short...the product sucks period."
2,I love these old cartoons,I remember watching these cartoons when I was a kid. They are actually still fun to watch although very predictable. Good memories.
2,Rediscovered a Classic,"I, like another reviewer here, grew up listening to this. It was on tape and my mother would play it on lazy weekend mornings in the kitchen while cooking brunch. I also remember being fascinated with the cover art.I just recently heard ""Celestial Soda Pop"" on Public Television as background music for a travel show and it took me back to those peaceful mornings. This music just seems to transport the soul and help create memories. It's wonderful."
1,Bad listing,This product was listed in the LPs section (meaning on vinyl). When I received it it was a CD. Bad job on Amazon's part not putting products where they should be.
2,Covered most of the gray,I had okay results with this product. I have thick hair so I think two boxes would work better for me if I use this product again. I also wish more conditioner was in the box. I needed more so I had to use some I already had on hand. My hair was a bit dry after using this product so not sure if I would buy this product again.
1,A real turkey,"Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in ""The Mosquito Coast"" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful. I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well. This film, however, was a huge disappointment. I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting. The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill). Not recommended at all."
2,arnold jacobs,"This cd tries to capture arnold jacobs: a prolific teacher, player and above all a great man. while listening, you'll discover the ideals, the methods and ideas that made arnold jacobs the best tuba player that there'll probably ever be. The more complex issues and artistry of brass playing are explained in simple words and sayings. a great deal of jacobs' lectures is also given, and you can also see the importance of understanding the functioning of other body units that help us trough our playing (the brain). a great disc, highly recommended, not only for tuba players, but for all brass players."
2,This is only the beginning,"Being a Marvel Fan, i understood, unlike others, that this was only telling the beginning of the story. I liked it and looking forward to the next one."
2,when the band you're in starts playing different tunes. . .,"Really fascinating patchwork of papers -- should inspire you to read the equally thought-provoking autism narratives of Temple Grandin and Donna Williams -- not to mention Uta's own AUTISM: EXPLAINING THE ENIGMA and possibly AN ANTHROPOLOGIST ON MARS, by Oliver Sacks. This book opens up some interesting questions about the nature of genius (to explore at your own risk) and on the level of pure entertainment, offers some very funny anecdotes. My only qualm: Asperger syndrome, like ADD, has an insanely high potential for misdiagnosis. What is the difference between someone with a genuine Social Disability and someone who perhaps has simply read too much Ayn Rand at an impressionable age?"
1,an attempted jazz recording,"Not sure what to say about this. I've made the mistake of acquiring some jazz records with recomendation - this being one of them. A mistake for certain. I'm not very aware of the bands other recordings, although they appear to be more swing oriented - so I passed. This record looked inviting, but sounds like a third rate, quickly thrown together set of average high school band geeks attempting to pass off some poorly executed jazz covers. Completley incomplete, this record lacks even a hint of sophisticated muscianship. I wholeheartedly recomend exploring other jazz records before settling here."
1,"Okay, but a bit over the top","It's a good book with a strong point, but the message grows tiresome. Practically everything is a potential security weakness to this guy. If you lock the doors, he warns about the windows. If you encase your house in concrete, I'm sure he could find some concrete eating bacterium from the jungle. It grows a bit tiresome.I'm a bit surprised that he's actually in the security business. How can he hold such views and actually make recommendations to clients? Does he say, ""Gosh this solution is terribly dangerous, but it's not as dangerous as the other solutions?""Plus, he's obviously a bit out of touch. He says that steganography can't work because no one ever sends him a picture. Heck, I get pictures from my family members all of the time. What's wrong with him?It's not a bad book, but it's a bit too much."
2,"Tom Hanks, You're no Jim Carrey","and i'm greatful for that...one of the few comics who was able to make the successful transition to dramatic actor. denzel is excellent as hank's lawyer who comes to term's with his latent homophobia...my favorite scene in the movie is when hanks goes into diva mode describing a opera piece sung by maria callas. i have the song on a c.d. somewhere. hanks probably gave an even better performance when he gave his best actor oscar acceptance speech, thanking a high school teacher who was gay. so emotional."
1,just okay,This product is not great. It is a really small quantity for the price. It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky but it does not really add anything to my face care process. I finished the lotion and moved onto a different one and had no change in how my face feels or looks. I think you can get a better product for less money elsewhere.
2,effective but not convenient,"It cleans ok, but doesn't produce lots of buddles during the cleaning. The thing I don't like is that it's hard to carry it around when I go to public laundry houses. Sometimes I put it in a bag and sometimes a plastic box; when I transfer the power out, it spills all over my bathroom. It's just not convenient enough!"
2,Great Addition for Harry Potter Fans,Very useful for finding out about Hermione's cat Crookshanks!!!
1,An example of self-hatred and internalized homophobia,"This book should insult any gay man who considers himself to be an intellectual. Full of faulty logic, purple prose, gross generalizations, and accounts of Browning's crusing experiences, the textoffers a disturbing, degrading picture of homosexuality. Despite a section on the works of Michel Foucault, the text demonstrates no knowledge of political ontology; also, the text avoids mentioning the works of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and David Halperin, but it posits Camille Paglia as an intellectual diety--look out! The correlation between coming out and becoming ""born again"" just doesn't work: the former is an outward, social/public event, and the latter is an inward, spiritual one. Nonetheless, the cover of the book reproduces a beautifu, homoeroticl print by Paul Cadmus."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"This is a worst book about women that I have ever red. Instead buy ""How to Succeed With Women"" by Ron Louis, David Copeland."
1,Skip this - Buy something else,"After playing it maybe 5 times, the screen went out and all you get now is sound. Not recommended."
1,Fun for one season,The kids had lots of fun on it for the first season. Took it out this season and it will not hold air and is coming apart at the seams. I reported this to toyquest.com and am waiting for them to respond.
2,love the scenery created,"The charectors are interesting and I love the images/scenery described. Ive heard it may become a movie which would be great, but I really hope they change the ending if so. Hated the way it ended for the lead."
2,Much nicer than the photo,"The photo for this item is washed out and displays the toy with curled, distorted ""wings"" -- the actual item is has smooth wings and the orangy-red coloration on the sides of the head is nice and bright. The material it's made from is silky and the whole item appears well-made."
2,Nice movie,"This is a typical nice Doris Day movie. It's a movie about the little guy fighting the big guy. Doris Day being the little small business owner, who happens to ship lobsters. It's not a serious social statement type film, has some laughs. Doris Day is as good as she is in any of her films. I bought this film for my mother who likes to watch older musicals and comedy films. She liked it."
1,Worthless Crap!,"Do NOT buy Excalibur or ""Forever Flashlights"" unless you want to waste your money. I too was lured by the idea of saving money on batteries and lightbulbs. And I was also impressed by the ""Forever"" title, which gave me the impression of a life-long product. Well just within a year after buying one it no longer works the way it's supposed to. Shake it, push the button, and no light. But shake it while the button is in the on position and the light will flicker on and off like a strobe light! That was kinda fun for about 7 seconds. So, the capacitor stopped holding the charge. For those who don't know, a capicator is just a battery. Now it's a useless, ugly paperweight, soon to be landfill crap. This thing is made rugged though, so it should last about a million years in a landfill!! :("
1,Ship of foolishness.,"I just don't get it. The production team behind DARK CASTLE films are reputable movie makers, however, so far all three of their flicks fail to do anything but produce lots of eye rolling. As with HOUSE ON HAUNTD HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS, GHOST SHIP starts out great, then falters. Great production values and decent premises are there, but all three films progress into either the absurd, or are just muttled by a confused plot or lack there of. Lowest common denominator movie watching especially for fans of the genere. Pretty much before GHOST SHIP left port, it sunk."
2,Great Product!,"We gave the Staub to friends as a gift. They were absolutely delighted and made us dinner in it! Fabulous winter stew turned out wonderfully! The pot conducts heat perfectly, holds heat in to keep the food warm for long periods of time and is absolutely lovely sitting on the stove. All of us are delighted with the pot!"
1,Paranoid world view,"I first read this book back when it first came out, in the early 1990's I think it was. At the time I found to be a very poorly written and very clumsy novel. I have read some of the author's other works and find his paranoid world view to be more than I can take. I recently tried re-reading this particular book again and find it even harder to read than my first attempt. It is not something I would recommend to any one."
2,Perfect compliment to What To Expect,Takes the nutrition aspect of preganancy one step further. A great addition to the other pregnancy books. It give you ideas and tips for how to eat what you already know you need to eat.
2,Jack Hill directs this little bizarre classic film!,"One of the last films in Lon Chaney Jr.s career. The great Sid Haig is in this film as well. Carol Ohmart steals the show as a spider obsessed vixen who, with a net and knives, catches any intruder with her personal spider web. Watch out for the ending!"
2,Satisfied,Delivery good. Aircast works. Good quality of materials.Playing golf without pain once again.
1,Save your money.,This book is dated in its information and outdated at the same time. I purchased this book years ago and after reading it was very disappointed. The constant raving about Nixon got tiresome and the technological aspects do not apply to today's technology advancements. This book rates with Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book. Lame. Save your money and buy a military manual or at the very least something that is up to date and not political. Also the recipes in this book are very dangerous and I question even if they would work half way.
1,What the hell Happened?,"I'd have to say that blink 182 sucks now. Their older stuff was much better. Their first release was probably the best.I HATE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEM PUNK NOW. THEY AREN'T PUNK AT ALL. THE BAND EVEN CALLS THEMSELVES PUNK. THAT IS SO ANNOYING. This cd and band is horrible. After this cd and selling out, I lost my interest in the band. They were much better AND MORE PUNK with the old drummer. This band used to be good and now are just for teenybopper girls and homosexual boys. For some of the other reviews, blink 182 isn't the only band that writes their own music and plays their own instruments. If you want real punk, try Bad Religion (The best punk band ever), Pennywise, NOFX, MXPX, Good Riddance, Descendents (which blink 182 does NOT sound like), and any other REAL punk band. BLINK 182 IS NOTHING BUT A JOKE!"
2,Recipes are great.,"I really liked the idea of a year of recipes, but having tried this out for a week so far, I've found it lacking. Although I loved the idea of a weekly grocery list, this makes skipping recipes impossible, which I have to sometimes because they call for equipment that I don't own (like a BBQ grill) or foods that I can't eat, and the portion sizes vary tremendously. However, all the recipes for the first week I tried were delicious and not too complicated."
1,RIPOFF!,"How can anyone expect to pay almost $20 for this? I think that it's an insult to anyone who considers themselves a Springsteen fan, whether old or young, for the record company to reduce his finest work (his first 5 albums) to one lousy CD. C'mon, 2 songs from the River?!!! If this isn't a blatant attempt by Columbia to ride on the coattails of Bruce & E Street's recent tour success, then I don't know what is. Save your money."
2,An amazing story full of the truth that no one faces,"Not very many people face and recognize how many teenagers face pregnancy. But Plummer has told so trufully a story of one of the many teenagers that are told that they are pregnant. I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down, not even to eat and sleep! I love how Plummer has told this story with not only two peoples point of views, but three. This book is truly amazing!"
1,Forget about buying this,Not worth the $5.99 I paid for it. Rent it or watch it online first before you buy. I had a hard time staying awake.
2,Works very well,"I purchased this card for a Kodak digital camera. It works just great! On a 4mp camera, the 2gb card gives me over 1700 pics, or 88 minutes of video. Not bad! It seems to work very well. Well worth the money"
2,A WILD AND WOOLEY TAIL,Black Sheep is one of those movies that when it starts you think you wont like it but then it becomes so endearingly loopy you end up going along with this wild and wooley tail(tail not tale on purpose).Who can resist a scene with a sheep driving a truck.And where else can you see a victim fight off a killer sheep with his own dismembered leg.Another scene involves gassy sheep and a zippo lighter.Our hero tries to crawl past the mutant sheep covered in lamb wool only to have an amorous male sheep take special interest in him.The movie has enough wacky elements to make it fun to watch and for those who need it it also has buckets of gore and i am proud of myself that i made it through this review without mimicing a bleating sheep.
1,can't play DVD - incompatible with my DVD players,"Could not play the DVDs. They were incompatible with our DVD players. Source was ?? ""German"" and required a ""password"" of some kind. Would still like to get a useable copy of Scarlet."
1,First-gen TabletPC to avoid.,"It's not the worst tablet to own, but it doesn't hit any of the sweet spots for a tablet other than WiFi abilities.1) It's not convertible, so you have to buy a USB keyboard for data entry.2) It's not using WindowsXP for Tablets, so you don't get the integration of Microsoft's specific handwriting recognition abilities.3) The hardware is pitiful, clearly offering power-saving compromises to overcome some engineering problems. The CPU is slow, the RAM is limited, and your hard drive isn't exactly fast or large.The best of the first-gen tablets was the Fujitsu Stylistic, but it cost twice as much. Of course, it also had twice as much ability. For tablet shoppers, the second-gen offers WindowsXP for Tablets, Office 2003 with OneNote (really leverages the tablet's strong points), better CPU selections and more mature engineering (convertibles!). Toshiba's Portege 3500 is probably the best tablet in the second generation, and that's the one you buy.Fred"
1,Boring read...,"I was very disappointed with this book. The book is represented as a book about Russet's father, this was not the case. The book details the life of Tim Russet rather than his father. Although many references were made about his father is was not about him. I bought this book to learn about being in WWII and the ""greatest generation"", Big Russ' generation. If you are a Tim Russet fan and wish to learn more about him and his Democrat background this book is for you."
2,compact is the wrong description,"I don't know about how long they last, but they are the largest compact fluorescent bulbs I've seen. I only use them in a few places, because they don't fit well under lampshades and ceiling fixtures with standard globes.It's a good price if you can use very large ""compact"" fluoresent bulbs."
1,disappointment,"After much consideration, I chose this over the Nespresso, because of the positive reviews. It is uglier in person than the picture depicts,(big, plastic), noisy, and takes too long to heat. The foam is not nice either. Back to the nespresso -- quiet, good foam, looks nicer on a counter, takes up less room, and you have the option to just heat the milk without the foam, if desired."
2,The Time!,"The writer's are precise in their name reference to the western devil. Art imitating life. Great job writers, directors, producers and crew. Bravo!"
1,Satan enters the handheld market!!,"Stay away from this product, It's EVIL!!!!!This unit is completely useless. It crashes even with full power while doing a simple Note or Word document. Pictures jpg, gif, or any other format, (Even with installing the companion software for it), look atrocious. It has to be re-synced and given a new name on your computer after each restart with the battery switch. This cannot be relied on in any way shape, or form.The only good reviews written on it are:1) Paid for by Toshiba.2) Written by someone who thinks they know what you did wrong, (It is not you).3) By someone who wants you to suffer as they have.Along the lines of always trying to stay positive here are some good things about it:1) The unit has no issues when powered off.2) It makes an attractive paperweight.3) Can be used to pound thumbtacks into the wall.4) It can be used as a fly swatter.5) Makes a great Rug-Hockey puck.6) It's handy dandy as a Windshield Ice Scrapper."
2,Excellent Book,"Very effective book, if followed strictly. I use for myself and for my patients, as a physical therapist. Better than anything any doctor will tell about treating neck pain."
2,Sheer Pantyhose,"I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose and thigh highs, I have been wearing them for about 15 years. They look and feel good on my legs and under my clothes. They are very sheer and sexy. I can wear them all day and they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles. They are also very durable, I usually get 5 or more wearings out of every pair.I used my Amazon Prime membership for the shipping and received free 2 day shipping. The packages arrived on time and in good shape."
2,the best cd by godsmack,i think this has to be there best album it has nice tunes such as whatever and stay away and voodoo and time bomb a definetly a must this cd is great and i really enjoy it.
1,Wish the lenses were bigger & darker - even though I ordered large!,"Good concept. Just wish the lenses were bigger an perhaps less flat across the lenses. The lenses smash against my dog's eyes. Tried adjusting the nose piece to prevent this. But after a few steps, the glasses don't stay in place and continue to smush his eyes. I have a pit bull mix with a pretty broad nose. This may work well for other breeds. Also would like the lenses to be darker. They seem fairly light. They are much lighter than in the pictures."
1,Very Disappointed,"My son bought this tent with his money, and the first time we set it up to see how it worked the outer pull broke. But he still used it the first time to camp. After that first time of camping he now has Three holes in the bottom of the tent and two holes in the side. Very thin material, considering we camp all the time and have had our other tent for 15 years and it has no holes. Now he has a new tent that is duct taped in several places with a broken arm, that probably won't last another two caming trips and is out the money he worked for and saved."
1,Fall apart castle,What a piece of junk dont waste your money. It is supposed to snap together just like the directions say Uh Yeah Right. Everything falls off and the music works only once in a while. If you ever so slightly touch or even look at the balcony funny it falls off.
2,Pretty good.,It's a good translation which was easy to follow. A good book if you want to learn more about Han Fei Zi.
2,Who doesn't like puppets?,"If you've got even a hint of imagination, you've gotta love puppets. And these puppets are no exception. Human puppets with even the slightest attention to detail are hard to come by. These are neat because you get a good blend of different characters to play with. The only downside is that they're not the easiest to manipulate...is it just my hands? I can't really find a way to move both of the arms and still have control of the head. Maybe I'm expecting too much from these puppets. At any rate, they're still going to be lots of fun as my daughter and I put on a puppet show. Pretending and imagination are developed by toys like these."
1,Stupid design/purchase,"Thermometer doesn't work on your wrist. It must be off your wrist for 20-30 minutes to get a good reading. You can't see the reading if it's about 9 o'clock or any hour:45.Other digits are easily obscured by the hands.THE BAND IS A NON-STANDARD TYPE (NO PINS) SO NOT EASY TO ADJUST. THE LINKS ARE TOO BIG AND PINCH HAIR. FINE LENGTH ADJUSTMENT IS LIMITED TO TWO HOLES ON THE CLASP, which doesn't cover the range of lengths you might want.Several design elements are totally frivolous. One has LCDs marking the seconds around the perimeter (good idea!) for the last 30 seconds of each minute, but not the first 30 secs (stoopid). Another shows how far along you are in the current 10 minute slice. As if.Like with pretty much all watches these days, you can't count on the alarm to wake you up.Gets maybe an extra star for being good looking."
1,"Akai LCD 26"" Bad buy","Purchased this tv, after six months it would power off when it got warm, so we exchanged for a newer model and now the new one after a year will not turn on. For a while if we pushed the power button over a 100 times it would finally come on a couple of nights ago it took an hour and a half before it would come on and tonight it does not come on at all."
2,This book can answer all your fertility questions!,"I have been telling my family and friends that my husband and I have been actively trying to conceive for 5 months. Well...after reading this book (I read it cover to cover in 2 days, by the way!) I realized that we really had not even begun to try! As educated as I thought I was and as knowledgeable as I thought I was about my body, I didn't know NEARLY enough about conceiving until I read this book! I am so happy... not just because I KNOW it will help me conceive but because I now know all about my body! This is not a book for those people looking for gimmicks, tricks or old wives tales. This book simply teaches you about your body so you will have everything you need to get pregnant (or avoid pregnancy). My husband and I loved it and we will continue to refer to it as we try to conceive our first child...something tells me it won't take long now! Thanks Toni!"
2,an outstanding theoretical text...,"after reviewing what other customers thought of gender trouble, i decided that it was time someone spoke in pain english.butler's feminist text is a brilliant critical examination of gender, a must for any reader interested in feminist or queer theory. the language is difficult, yet richly rewarding...go slow, let your mind explore the many avenues butler leads her reader down. after reading gender trouble, you may like the text, you may dislike it, but there is NO way that you won't learn a great deal and be introduced to a variety of original and provocative thoughts on feminism and gender studies.there is a reason why butler's gender trouble is widely considered one the revolutionary texts on feminist theory...so i encourage you to endure the ""difficult"" writing and broaden your horizons."
2,The Heart Of Success,"The Heart of Success is an intriguing book for any of us who are fascinated with success and achievement. The book takes an honest look at how a select group of incredibly gifted individuals have triumphed in the arts, athletics, business, and politics. Forty short success stories about the likes of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, NBA coach Red Auerbach, kidney dialysis inventor Belding Scribner, and the six-time Grammy-nominated opera star Frederica von Stade. While the individuals hail extremely different success stories, it is the underlying themes of will, discipline, intuitiveness, perserverence, and risk that ties these people together and makes thier stories cohesive. The Heart of Success is an easy read and one that answers questions for those of us who look at the great ""achievers"" in life and have always wondered how they did it."
2,Hidalgo,"Hidalgo was an amazing movie about Frank Hopkins, the last drunk american cowboy, that actually pulls of his reputation by entering the ocean of fire, a 3000 mile race across the Arabian desert. This movie was filled with emotion, it was a very underrated film for some reason but it racks up there in my book, 10 of 10 easly."
1,Quit working after the warranty expired,"Bought this for my wife because she is not a PC fan. Shortly after we received it, we had problems with it not charging. The company sent us a new power cord. Worked okay for a week or two and then same thing happened. We thought it was the cheap cord (made in China) and bought a cord from an Apple store. Didn't work. Two repair shops said it ""was toast."" Couldn't get a refund or replacement because it was past the 30-day warranty. Now it's a paper weight."
1,DONT DRIVE IN FLORENCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAP!!,We purchased this map from AMAZON only weeks before our trip to Italy. Either it was incorrect from the start or has never been updated since its publication....or there are one way gremlins afoot at the publishers!!After trying every approach into central Florence using this map we realized that at least HALF of one way streets are WRONGLY MARKED! Finally we chucked the map and followed the actual street signs and found our hotel.
2,Small size with lots of info,I had this same book for when I lived in NM. Now here in the NW (ID) I got this one. I am a biologist and find this book very helpful in the field.
1,Fall Apart Racing to the Mall,"We bought this for Christmas for our 6 year old. She loved playing with it for a day or two, but it will not stay put together! It is flimsy as others have posted. I would like to give this product a better review but due to the poor quality, I can't. The track sits untouched because it's too frustrating trying to keep it put together. Don't buy it."
1,where did Capt. Marvel go?,"After watching Thor and Capt. America with my grandchildren, I asked them where was Capt. Marvel and they did not know who he was. How sad he is lost. The serial was a lot different that the comic books I remember, as little Billy was a crippled seller of newspapers on the street then who used Shazam to become Capt. Marvel. The story line itself was interesting since the 'Scorpion' was a cheezy villian. It was great fun to watch and brought back the days, when for a dime you could see a feature picture, a b picture, a cartoon, newsreel and a serical. Popcorn was a nickel. In Spiro, OK the theater was segregated, but I loved to sit in the balcony anyway. Glad those days are gone."
1,Never Again Without Reading the Review First!,"First of all I have read every Spenser book to date, I hung in there when they stunk, knowing Parker would eventually get his act together. He did, and I kept reading. Just finished Hugger Mugger it should be titled Mug a Reader! What a waste of time I almost didn't finish it! I read to the end with the hope it would get better. The only enjoyment I had was reading about Spenser's feelings for Susan, their relationship is one I envy.Total waste of paper and my money. I will never read another Spenser without checking the NY Times Book review first."
1,junk,"Small amount of rain collapsed side, stretched awning and bent legs. I bought the name brand as I thought it would be more durable that say a Dick's brand, wrong answer. Not to mention that two feet on each side is not the roof, but where the legs go out too. Total disappointment, total junk. I've owned many canopies, gazebo's and awnings, for the price this was the worse value."
2,Looking to expand my my taste in metal,"Less melodic than I am used to but the band is incredibly skilled. not exactly my style, but I recognize the skill."
1,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman","I was going to order the 2nd volume of Mary Hartman only to find out: #1 It's not on DVD, but VHS! I don't have a real problem with that since I have a combo-player. However, the reviews have showed that the tape is a rip-off! Missing episodes which obviously makes it harder to follow the story.Also, it is extremely short, timewise. Why doesn't someone create a decent, professional Volume 2? Then, and only then will I by it!Marilyn Murphy"
2,A great book for anyone restoring an Isetta!,"Having recently fallen in love with this tiny bubble-car made by BMW in the late 50s and early 60s, I was surprised to find myself with one, albeit a fixer-upper, in short time. After going to a minicar and microcar meet, the other Isetta owners said: 'You must buy this book!' and 'This book is truly amazing!' I got the book and indeed they were right: this book is astounding. Mr. Jensen offers insightful step-by-step guidance with useful pointers and tips for every facet of restoring the 1958 sliding window export model of 'the rolling egg.' When I bought my Isetta, the seat and inside panels were missing. Imagine my joy when I found, in the book, templates for the panels and a design for a replacement seat. It was almost a spooky, spine-tingling, X-files kind of sensation. It this thoroughness into the restoration process that I found extremely useful. Indeed, this book is truly amazing and, if you are restoring or upkeeping an Isetta, you must own it."
1,Swizz needs to change hiz beatz!,"I don't know how many times Swizz can use the same beats, but just add a different hook. Swizz snapped when he first came out, but after a while, you get tired of hearing the same thing over, and over again. He didn't hook DMX up on his last CD, and he f--cked-up Drag-on's debut album. He needs to change it up, or stop. I must admit that ""Twisted Heat"" by Twista & Drag-On is tyte, but Swizz needs some new Beatz."
1,Not a good product,"I bought this because it was much cheaper online than at the store, but I wish I would have spent the money to buy it at the store. This product is a huge waste of money. I pink started peeling off a few days after I put it on my phone. It is completely peeled off except for a few parts. The only purpose it serves now is to protect my phone. Spend the money at the store don't buy it online."
1,"A disappointing, very predictable read","If this book has been recommended to you because you have enjoyed books by Earlene Fowler, Jean Hager, and/or Sandra Dallas, forget this one. I found the characters and the plot to be very predictable, and the style reminded me more of what one might find in a Harlequin romance. Very disappointing."
2,"Not sure that it does what it says, but my boyfriend likes it.","I use this stuff mostly for the scent. It has a very pleasant, soft scent that enhances my regular perfume. My boyfriend really likes it, but I think it's mainly for the scent, not because of some attractant power. I don't get hit on more or anything.I've read that Pherlure and Athena both really do work if you are looking for something effective. They are both more pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Review of Talking Heads C.D.,"This isn't the time to be stocking up on ""talking heads"" recordings. The recording was a disappointment. I would not encourage a friend to buy another ""heads"" recording."
2,love it,"the case fits my 14"" widescreen laptop perfectly. It also looks nice, was a great bargain, and fits a ton of other textbooks/folders in the storage compartment. I think this is a great buy. The engineering and appearance of the bag gives it a look of quality. highly recommended."
2,Great Stroller!!!!,After A LOT of research I chose this stroller and I am very happy with it. It fully reclines so you can use it for a one month old newborn and you can use it for a child up to 55lbs max. It is well made and nicely padded. I find it very easy to open and fold. It holds a diaper bag on it's handle and will not tip backwards. It looks different in a very cool way. The only drawback is that the underbasket cannot hold large items due to a large X frame. But it holds many small to medium sized bags. This stroller knocks Maclaren out of the park!!!!!
2,Who let the dog out!!,I bought the Melissa & Doug Chihuchua Plush as a gift for a co worker. I was very surprised by the quality of the item. It was a great gift and I look forward to buying another Melissa & Doug animal.
1,Why did Avery make this product much worse?,"I was happy using CD Stomper several years ago. After reading several negative reviews, I was wondering about this newer product, but I ordered one to try out. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative reviewers. Because of the unnecessary tabs, the sheet jams all the time. I use Canon Pixma MP150. This printer has no problem with the previous product or any other papers. This newer product is thinner, so it is very difficult to tear off. I really don't understand why Avery made this wonderful product much worse. I will never use this product again."
2,song in the movie,"Hello, there is one song that is all instrumental. It's got a ""surfer"" kinda vibe to it . .it almost sounds like Dick Dale. Do any of you know the name of that song that is being plaid when ""sh%t break"" is running through the school trying to make it to the men's room? If you know this song please post it i've been searching for it for the longest time."
1,was alright,Was not like they say it should of been. The original was way better. Always be better too.Nothing else to say about it..
2,North Dallas Forty,The book was a Christmas gift and arrived in a very timely manner. The recipient has already read the book. It was in excellent shape. Thank you!
1,Warning for small business users,"If you have a two-line phone system and a two-line answering machine, then this printer is not going to work for you if you need the fax feature. You don't learn this until you start to have problems. Then you read that the supplied telephone cable is a 2-wire cable and that your answering machine must be connected to the printer.Considering the printer is called an ""OfficeJet"", it's not very office friendly! I am amazed! What were they thinking when they designed this product?"
1,Disposable Cover Song,"The first time I heard this I wanted to kick my TV screen in. Apparently, Sixpence think so highly of this song they're willing to sell it to the hucksters for commercial use. I'm with the LA's fans, get their version which is on a great album. I hope this trend doesn't get out of hand--mediocre bands selling cover versions of great songs to ad agencies. Thank goodness for the Neil Young's of the world who will never sell out."
2,Close Inexpensive Shaver,This shaver is rated right at the top by Consumer Report and they are right! Doesn't trim your pocket book and gives a quick close shave!
1,Maybe later...,My 14 month old LOVES sesame street and doesn't like this video. She actually opens the DVD player and throws the DVD whenever I play it!
2,"Laugh out loud, bend over funny","No doubt this is one of my top 5 favorite comedies. Not just amusing, but laugh out loud, bend over funny. You have to see this movie. I'm not sure why its not considered a classic. I'm waiting until it's released on DVD to add it to my collection."
2,THE classic cult film,"Finally! It's out on DVD - the cult film to end all cult films. Certainly the greatest film ever to star Emilio Estevez. It's a real tour de force, the story being a complex tale - part alien conspiracy (x-files eat your heart out), part road movie, part pure science fiction, and part screwball comedy. Basically a car containing an alien entity has been stolen, and all and sundry are after it, including some repo men, who are after the car as there's a $25000 bounty on it. Harry Dean Stanton is his usual brilliant self, but in truth, the whole supporting cast are brilliant. Special mention must go to director Alex Cox - he has never been able to match this modern masterpiece, and never will. He can be thanked for the little touches - the punk, dying in the store, blaming society, the store itself containing all manner of items marked food, drink etc..pure genius. Buy this film - it is the greatest B film of all time."
2,Up in the Air Review,"The DVD was just like a new one. I was actually cast as an ""extra"" in that movie. I can be seen for a few seconds just to the left of George Clooney on the dance floor at the wedding reception. Since I am in it, I definitely wanted a copy. My friend, (who was also cast as an extra, but you only see his bald spot) and I have shown it several times to our friends and family members. We are very happy with the quality. The movie was great! I don't think I could have found a better price with the same quality anywhere else."
1,Not the right size,I ordered one LONG-beanie black and when i got it. It was for a little kid or someone with a very super super small head. Don't buy this unless you are a little kid.
1,Would not purchase this if you want good sound quality,Poor sound quality - no adjustments for treble or bass - sounds cheap and tinny. Returned this product for refund.
2,Like it a lot,I've been enjoying this product for months. The only drawback is that it doesn't have anyway to stay in place - would be great if it had a strap or something else to keep it in place.
1,Didn't work for me....,"So I set this up. I even read the instructions. The instructions say to place it at the entrance of your yard rather than near your garden. Well my yard is wide open, no fence, hence the problem with deer in the first place. So I can't do that. maybe that's why it isn't doing it's job for me. The shocker definately works, I tried it. the logic that a deer will smell the scent, shock themselves, then be detered makes sense unless you have 4-5 deer that travel together. The unit takes 15 minutes to charge in between shocks. IF one gets shocked, there are still other deer that can keep eating my vegetables. I don't even know if I'm shocking one of them. I just know that this isn't working the way that I hoped. I gave it two stars because mechanically it works, I just don't think the product concept it as sound as it is made out to be. I will get one of those motion detecting hose sprayers that amazon sells, that is pretty fool proof. Next year will be a better season..hopefully."
1,Very easily came undone with shoulder straps!,I used the bag about 4 times to carry my rather light Yamaha P-95 keyboard to band practice (only 26 pounds). The bag tore out the seems under where the shoulder straps connect to the bag. I can see where they absolutely should not have put the ability to connect shoulder straps with such low quality seem connection. So... you CANNOT use the bag with shoulder straps. I now have a bag with 2 wide open seems to the insides of the bag - not good.
1,bike basket,This basket it s hard to put up and it keeps on moving....I tried to use it for my little dog and it could not hold him. My dog is only 6 pounds.It's really made with cheap material.:(
1,not satisfied with product,the product arrived in good condition and with all accompanying needed instructions. but it does not perform as stated in the description. we still get computer generated calls.
2,It's Got Heart!!,"The Melbourne (Aust) based Production Company recently revived 'Damn Yankees' for an all too brief season. This CD has a feeling very similar to that captured by the outstanding performances in Melbourne. Jarrod Emick is brilliant as Joe Hardy with great feeling and good strength and fine tone - much like David Harris brought to the role in the Australian production. The rest of the company also brings much verve and energy to the show.This is an excellent CD with very welcome added tracks that flesh out the story line for the uninitiated. A preferred choice to the original and now quite dated, production which is also available on CD. Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed, 'cause ""It's got Heart""!!"
2,Second review on Corona paper collection,"I concur with the assessment of the first reviewer (I am also from UCSB). A knowledgeable person can easily figure out some of the redaction except for the budget figures. The article is probably largely derived from the special issue of Corona published in the 70s in Studies in Intelligence. I have seen this volume at UCSB (from the 1995 meeting) in a colleague's office.Besides the geologic application, there are also the identification of chemical warfare sites (not completely certain how they made this accessment (it's can't just be double fences)), uranium mining in China, and other gems."
2,Likes,Works great so far. Saved me a lot of money !Falls over cuz Its So light but well Worth For Price. Good deal.Thanks!
2,A Bit Outdated,"Anthony does a great job of laying out methods for paying debt down. As with most financial books, this one out dates quickly, but the author provides some timeless advice. When read in conjunction with other financial help books, Anthony's ""Debt-Free by 30"" helps round one's understanding of paying off debt."
2,Quite pleased,"I'm quite happy with the Notebook Cooler. It's very easy to use, fits nicely under my iBook and keeps it noticeably cooler. My last computer overheated and fried the hard drive, so I was very concerned about this happening again. I'm pretty well convinced this will make the difference!"
1,Saints and Shadows is a bust,"I am sorry to everyone who liked this book but you are just wrong. I am a real lover of urban fantasy and was interested to read this book. I have enjoyed Jim Butcher and Ilona Andrews and Patricia Briggs and even some of Laurel Hamilton's work (the early ones), but this book was just terrible. Its plot was paper thin and the characters were completely cookie cutter with no depth. The bad guys were pure evil and the good guys pure good. The romance was predictable and boring. It was as if someone took the best of the urban fantasy books and said, ""I am going to write one too and do it one week"". I have no interest in trying this author again and recommend that anyone who reads this review head to the other authors that I have mentioned."
1,"Powerful concepts, trite examples","I found Three Minute Therapy to be chockfull of examples that were not compelling to me--people having panic attacks over elevators or paying bills, or a woman having an affair who wanted an ironclad guarantee of financial security should she leave her husband.Cognitive therapy is powerful, but I think that soemone considering this book would be better off with David Burn's ""Feeling Good"" books, which are better written, contain more depth, and deal with more day to day problems than Three Minute Therapy does."
2,"sex magick, karma, necromancy, the transmutation of feces...","Wow! A first-person account of the life of an aghora, a hindu mystic who has made it his life's mission to rise above fear and disgust and embrace reality as a seamless, non-dualist whole, paradoxes'n'all. Included here are many amusing and entertaining discussions of sex magick, karma, necromancy, the transmutation of feces into roast chicken, and a host of other off-beat topics. This book would worth the price of purchase for this insight alone: ..."
2,Crossroads 2007 DVD is great!,"The two disks of the DVD contain a wealth of extraordinaryguitar playing. Many guitarists from the 2004 DVD are included,like Robert Cray, Doyle Bromhall, B.B. King, John McLaughlin,Robert Randolph, John Mayer, Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy, Los Lobos,Jimmy Vaughan, and Vince Gill (and of course, Eric Clapton).Several guitarists appear on the 2007 DVD that weren't on the2004 DVD, like Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Jeff Beck, SteveWinwood, Sonny Landreth, Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson, allwelcome additions. A few guitarists, like Joe Walsh, JamesTaylor, Steve Vai, ZZ Top, J.J. Cale and Carlos Santana fromthe 2004 DVD don't appear on the 2007 DVD, but this is probablydue the way the two events were scheduled. If you like to hearthe guitar sing, this DVD is for you."
1,Don't buy this book,"The author is mainly interested in slamming Microsoft and object-oriented programming. Unfortunately, he never gets off this soapbox and gets around to teaching anyone how to write a complete program using VB Express. A complete and disappointing waste of time and money. I will most certainly avoid works by this author in the future."
2,Time Running Out,"OK, I GIVE UP. I am to the point where the price doesent matter,at the rate of release I may not live long enough to see the entire series.The way it's going it may be close. what a sad state of affairs to take another seven years to get the series.I HOPE THOES OFFICE PUKES AT PARAMOUNT CAN GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER."
2,Marcus at his best!,"This is a unique book. After a brief introduction highlighting the important biographical and philosophical parts of Marcus's life, the author recreates a historical meeting between the emperor, Galen (noted physician), Harnouphis (Egyptian high priest) and his brother Lucius (co-emperor) which took place in 168 AD. During this esteemed gathering each of the participants engages Marcus with philosophical questions. At other times Marcus is the inquisitor and asks his guests to express their beliefs. In this way a dialogue is established that brings to life what it must have been like to have been in the presence of each of these noteworthy individuals.Many books have sought to show us the life of Marcus Aurelius but this is the first one I have read which made me feel like I had been in the presence of the master himself. Bravo!"
2,DNA and Tradition: Ancient Hebrews,This is a great book with lots of information for anybody that wants to understand the concepts behind DNA and the link to the ancient Kohanim dynasty. The book is good for either neophytes or advanced individuals in the field of DNA that want a higher level of specific knowledge related to Cohen Modal Haplotype. The book further has a good linkage to the biblical versus that are the underpinning to the Kohanim group.
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED,THIS HAD TO BE THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. iT WAS UNBAREBLY SLOW AND BORING AND HAD NO REAL SUSPENSE SO IN SIMPLER TERMS IT SUCKED.
2,One of the best chick flicks ever,"Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!"
2,Best math book for graphics programmers I've found,"I've read quite a few math texts looking for an understanding of the math necessary for 3D graphics software. This was the first one that I was able to read straight through, like a novel. I highly recommend it for an understanding of 3D math. It has clear descriptions that build gradually."
1,Gigantic : the story of the author's ego (0 stars),"This is the worst biography ever published. The author is not clever or witty as i'm sure he believes himself to be. (he refers to himself as ""Gigantic"" in the 3rd person; what else needs to be said?) Clever if you consider that he's probably making money from the sale of this book on the strength of a great subject (pixies) and a cool cover. In addition to having no interviews with the band that weren't lifted from other sources, half of the book isn't even about the pixies. Every other chapter of this book is a short fictional work about a fan who becomes obsessed with Charles Thompson (Frank Black). This is just a cheap bait & switch to increase the thickness of the book and make it appear as if the author actually has something worth saying. Trust me no pixie fan, no matter how huge, could possibly find anything of value in this book."
2,Great,"This book was good. The best part was that there is finally a Xena book including my favorite character, Joxer."
2,The Original Mother Goose,"This book is in fantastic condition. It has the same pictures from my Mother Goose book that I had when I was a child, and that was many years ago. I'm sure the people this book is intended for will have a wonderful time reading it to their children."
2,perfect cheese curls,"this grater cuts cheddar,colby etc cheeses into short curls that melt or blend perfectly into sauces, omelets, or toppings."
2,Exactly what I needed,"Yes, I agree setup is difficult if you are not computer saavy. But I got it opened, configured, and playing music/slides on my family room TV in less than 2 hours while working on other things.I haven't done playlists, but overall I like the performance and interface. A great low cost option for people who have a wireless network and want to display photos or play music. Now I can move my CD Carousel to another room in the house!"
1,Every fine author lays an egg now and then,"We have seen it a million times: no matter how good you are, no matter how excellent your editors are, no matter what talent you have; every now and then a fine author turns out a loser. Violin is.Too bad. Anne Rice is excellent and her previous books have been image-filled, lush, unique and had that keep-'em-up-at-night quality. Violin, on the other hand, plays much like a concert you didn't particularly want to go to on a Friday night after a hard week. It puts you to sleep."
2,a voice from the other side,"Perhaps the title of this book should have been, ""Old men create policy and young men do the dying"". This book answers many questions for me, some i have carried around for decades. A must read, it belongs in every Vet Center and on the desks of politicians.Thank you Eddie for doing this one."
1,Dissapointing attempt at writing on important topic,"This book appears to have been butchered by non-scientific editors who have removed essential explanation of diagrams and shortened any sentence that appeared to have syntax that would trouble anyone over the age of thirteen. I opened it with high hopes since I was looking for a gentle introduction to an important topic that I could recommend as initial reading for students. But I hesitate to let students near it since it has so many mistakes and blunders. (One quote: `Together with Niels Bohr, Wheeler discovered fission'. Has any scientifically educated person looked through the text before publication??)The fact that diagrams are full of elements that are not referred to in the text is symptomatic of the very unprofessional way that this book has been produced. Aczel actually has some nice persnal anecdotes... what a wasted opportunity!"
2,Wow Nick,"I bought this CD just because I'm a pop music fan and I figured it would be an ""ok"" buy. But whoa! This is a whole lot better than I anticipated. Truthfully, though, I have not heard every song on the album because Just listening through on the first listen, a few songs really popped out that I continuously play over and over again. ""Help Me"", ""My Confession"", ""Miss America"", ""Heart Without A Home"", and ""I Just Wanna Take You Home"" will have you hooked for months (or at least until Timberlake's album comes out)! Especially Miss America. There's hints of rock on the songs Nick cowrote and the songs by others are more pop-ish. So there's lots of influence on this album. Overall, a Top 10 of 2002, at least until the pop scene erupts which started last week with Nick and Christina and will be going on for a few weeks now."
2,Really interesting bio.,The guy is actually more of a cheat with 3 card monte than a poker player. If you ever saw Rounders this guy is Worm not Knish. Great read though. This guy lived a high live. According to wiki he was broke on the end.
1,Step Away from the Gate,"This gate is simply worthless. After wasting two hours of my Labor Day, I finally have it attached to the wall. Using the templates was worthless, as they didn't match up correctly. After drilling countless holes in the wall, I finally found a semi-straight alignment. Now the gate doesn't close without using significant pressure, and it takes two hands and a foot for my wife to get it open.This gate was designed by a very cruel individual who likes to make parents suffer.Stay far away from this gate."
1,LBD,"I tried to read LBD: It's a Girl Thing by Grace Dent. I tried to like it, I really did. But the writing was weak, the characters dull, immature, and slutty, and just like Louise Rennison's books, she tried so hard, *too hard* to sound quirky that it all came out wrong. I had to stop reading when I got to ""What have the grown-ups got up their sleeves next? Full Muslim burkas to be worn by all under eighteen?"""
2,The Adventure of The Watsons Go To Birmingham,"In the Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham the main characters are Kenny, Byron, Mama, Dad, and Joey. Some of the main events that take place in The Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham are Kenny helping Byron get his lips of the frozen poll outside. Also, when Byron decides to go out and get a conk without his parents permission and ruining his African American hair. The most important event in this story I think is when the Watsons Go to Birmingham on there vacation. This book is mostly fiction is only has one real event that actually happens in real life. The event that is real is when white people bombed an African American church!"
2,for the the grown and sexy,the album would have got 5 stars from me if 2 tracks weren't so bad well i wont say bad i'll say just was not that moveing good music is supose to move your feelings up and down like a rollercoaster some people not what i mean by that but all in all the album was i think was money well spent. it's a good R. kelly/MJ/james brown/112/jodeci/boys to men/NE kind of album he mixed a lot of styles and i think thats really cool if done right.
2,It's for a Mac; of course it works.,It was painless. Just like my Mac.The only pain will be when it goes for $25 next week. Or next month.
1,Poor sound quality!,"Though the musica has mucho potencial'...la qualita de recording es terrible'! Save your money....or buy it from me for dirt cheap, mi amigo/a !"
1,"dead birds? dead slow, dead plot","This movie starts off very promising and goes nowhere fast (actually it goes nowhere quite slow). A group of confederate soldiers rob a bank and hole up in a farmhouse for the night. So far so good.Now, we are treated to a very very slow buildup that goes nowhere. Lots of atomosphere but no substance. And the last half of the movie makes no sense. Demon children that hide under the bed, a dead wife that is never explained, and what looks like a werewolf (where did he come from?), and a man vanishing into smoke make for one totally incomprehensible ending. And let's not forget the title of the movie which also makes no sense. What a waste of such a good start to a flick."
1,no hope,"i bought this book to get understanding and to try and figure out why wicca is growing and spreding faster than Christianity in our area. i still do not know why. after reading the book i saw how unorganized and everything the religion is. it offers no hope to those who believe and certainly there is no ""power to be obtained""... i found the book not only uninteresting, but probably the most misleading of any i have read so far."
2,More than I expected,"I bought this book for my grief study by accident, and it ended up being a ""good"" accident because it is a great compilation of different scenarios in grief. It is more of a book for someone trying to understand the family system in grief and is more a textbook for students than someone who is directly grieving and wanting to know more about what to expect and how to cope."
1,Should have read reviews,"I always read reviews, but didn't think it necessary for such a minor purchase. I should have...it shrunk! Not just a little either...it's not useable."
1,Skip this Printer and do your self a favor!,"DO NOT but this printer.....it ALWAYS needs to have the head cleaning utility used, and doing this, wastes all your ink! At 25+ a pop for ink, it is NOT worth it! You can NOT leave the printer off for a few days, without needing to run the nozzle cleaning util like 3 times, to print something decent!!WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!Do your self a favor, and stay clear of this printer!!"
2,Wyoming,"I keep ordering more of these socks. Long wearing, comfortable even in summer, but I particularly like them for wearing when I do the barn chores in our cold weather. They seem to breath fairly well, so my feet are warm, but not sweaty!"
1,Will not unwind,The antenna will not unwind from the reel. I returned this one and will trySangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antennawhich looks very similar to this one.
2,Some good songs,"There are a few good songs on this cd, especially the first one How to Save a Life by the Fray. I love Grey's Anatomy and the producers really picked the songs for the soundtrack well b/c each song reminds me of the show somehow."
1,Junk,"Came apart on the first use. I knew I was taking a risk buying this but I went for it because I have had good luck before with similar items, I guess my luck ran out."
2,Fun But Trying,Twilight Princess is a wonderful game. Awesome graphics and an old so familiar concept. Once again you must deliver Hyrule from the hands of the deviant Ganondorf. The graphics are great and it feels good. Using the Wiimote just feels natural in this game. Now for the bad part. Fishing with the Wiimote is a hassle. Annoying and frustrating come to mind as words to use for this requirement. You could literally be stuck for hours trying to catch one fish. I've tried various methods and none really seem to help. You just either catch it or you'll get frustrated and give up. Also there is a major glitch in the game where if you save in a particular area you are pretty much done. I've not seen any tips for getting out of it. Other than these two concerns the game play is fine. I've not played the GameCube version of the game to see if it fares any better but its a good game for the Wii (other than fishing).
1,Not One Of The Best,"This was the first book that I've ever read by James Neal Harvey. I have to say the artistry on the front of the book does absoulately nothing for the actual contents inside of it. I found this book to be a very slow read, that is until the last 100 pages. Near the end things seemed to pick up and go quickly along. The romance that was in the book was rushed through, there was too much police talk in the beginning which may have been what turned me off a little bit. I just didn't find the book to be as captivating as I thought it would be. This only proves one thing ""NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER""!"
2,Great Garmin mount,"I put this in my Dodge Charfer patrol car after my suction cup mount regularly fell off the windshield. While working I frequently accelerate, hit the brakes, drive through the interstate median and take corners fairly fast due to calls I am dispatched to. I have had this mount in my car about a month now and it hasn't moved at all from the day I put it in. I have not been disappointed."
1,A shipwreck,"Many parts of Life of Pi are well written and Martel has a unique writing voice. This story lagged in the middle and about halfway through the book, I was hoping that either a shark would eat Pi, the tiger would drown or they would both get rescued. The book is definitely based on a good idea and it sticks with the reader. However, the book wasn't worth my time and I don't understand all the hype about it."
2,The River of Doubt: expedition and metaphor,"The River of Doubt is about both a journey of geographic exploration, and the challenges that people set for themselves. This expedition is as much about the individuals who took part as it is about the exploration of the river.Reading the book gave me a taste of the Amazonian rainforest, the dangers of unknown exploration and a sense of the courage of most of the participants.Clearly, both Theodore Roosevelt and Colonel Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon were extraordinarily talented men.It left me with a sense of sadness that this triumphant achievement did not bring a greater sense of fulfillment to most of the survivors.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Deathly Hallows part 2,Saw this at the cinema and at home after purchasing the dvd. 3D at the cinema didn't enhance the film at all and I enjoyed it more without having to wear an etra pair of glasses to see limited 3D effects. If you forget the books and just take the film as the final sequel it rounds everything out fairly well. Voldemort was played very well and is the reason to watch this finale for the main part but is disappointing when he turns whimp at the end. Overall I enjoyed the film.
2,Worked Great,The repair kit did a great job at fixing the flat tire on my bike. It was easy to use and came with enough pieces to fix many more flats.
2,When the Levees Broke,This is a superbly done piece on Hurricane Katrina. My hat is off to Spike Lee.
2,The strongest book of the series,The third book of the Witches of Eileanan series is the strongest with Isabeau asserting herself and running afoul of the Righ by stealing Bronwen.The more we see of Maya and her machinations the more fascinating she becomes. Isabeau's finding of her mother and father and the battle with the Mesmearden are strong elements of the story. The remnants of the AWL hold a powerful resonance of contemporary society and the intolerances inherent.There are three more books to come. ...
1,Why?,"Why in god's name would anyone remake Ordinary World??? The original was (scratch that, IS) beautiful, thus it should have been left alone. Please DJs/Remix artists of the world, turn your attention to lesser music, not classics like this."
2,Good Stuff...,"This is the good stuff. Even my grandma would be shakin' to this first wave skankin' reggae. For the Brits out there, it's worth the price for ""Soul Limbo"" alone, which you will fondly recognise as the raw and vibed-up original of the BBC's cricket music. Absolutely inspirational! If you've come so far as to read this, don't hesitate to buy. This music willl make you happy."
1,Does not fit LitterMaid exactly,I've tried all kinds of automatic litterboxes. The LitterMaid gets stuck often. These boxes do not fit as well as the ones that came with it. A nonautomated litterbox has worked best.
1,We Have All Been Here Before,"The basic plot line is a direct lift of Shallow Grave, a better acted and directed film. Do yourself a favor if you're tempted by this and see Shallow Grave instead."
1,NO customer service,My son received this gun for Christmas. All but three darts were ruined by either the loading mechanism or the air pressure during the first day of use(chopped/broken shafts or blown out near the rubber cap). I have emailed BuzzBee on several occasions and had absolutely no response. I would not purchase this or any other BuzzBee product- I will be spending the extra money for higher quality NERF products in the future.
2,Great information about a confusing time:,I bought this book for my son. I have read the entire thing cover to cover and have decided that he is only ready for some of the material at this point. He will be allowed to read the whole thing in a year or two. This book gives great info on health and hygiene as well as changes in the body during puberty. There are comments about becoming sexually active that I am not comfortable with at this point but I think that may just be because I don't think my son is old enough for the details.I do recommend this book but encourage parents to read it and decide for themselves if their son(s) should read the whole thing or not.
2,President CEO,Finding special accessories for older electronics can be challenging.The Palm Tungsten 2 e PDA would ONLY recognize a 1 gig expansion card.Amazaon was the ONLY place I was able to locate one.
1,Not very impressive.,"I'm a big fan of the Flecktones, and Victor Wootens bass skills especially, but this CD just doesn't cut it for me. I thought there'd be some major jam sessions, there are, but at the cost of some very cheesy and poorly written lyrics. There is way to many special guest at times, and all of the chatter on stage during sounds gets very annoying. I expected only Victor and a bass guitar, true, there are a few songs where it's just him, but then the rest of the group ruins it. Maybe my expectations were to high after hearing his work on the Flecktones......."
1,No benefit of owning this title.,The title seems different than what the content should be. Has a fancy looking cover but lagging in content. The example programs found in this book are not very good at all. This book was hard to read and provided little use to me. Their is no approach to learning how to build the applications in this book - eveything is slapped together by topic and it jumps around to much to follow along. The book attemps to teach Visual Basic Database Programming and Visual Basic Game Programming but never seems to be on cue. I would rather buy a book on each type of programming seperatly (ex. Visual Basic Game Programming or Visual Basic Database Programming). I would not run out and try to launch a career after reading this book.
1,Excellent Movie But I will never see it,I was not aware(my fault) that I could not play this dvd on a US cd player. It is in Australian format that I guess I was unaware was different. Great movie if I ever get a US version. Recommended but How many Stars? I couldn't see it.
2,Awesome wok spatula,"I love this thing. Makes me feel like I work in a chinese restaurant! The curve at the tip fits the wok perfectly and makes it easy to stir fry with. The wood handle comes unattached and you have to press it into the metal handle when you get it, but so far it is holding up well."
1,Not Easy To Use,"I just wanted a pouch to hold my leatherman skeletool. I got this one online. It looks good but it is not designed to fit on a belt, which is what I want it for. So I have to say , that it is next to useless. The description provided does not inform buyers that this is not suitable for belt use. Waste of money."
2,Good coffee maker,Heats the water to 180 degrees F which is hot enought to brew green tea and make a good cup of coffee. It is well worth the amount of money I paid for it. I do recomend this product.
2,Mechanix Wear are the best automotive gloves!,These types of gloves are the only ones I use when working on vehicles.
2,How much better is the remastering?,"For those of you who own this CD, may I please ask for an ear comparison between this ""remastered"" version and the 1990 Bangles Greatest Hits CD? I have the 1990 Greatest Hits, which doesn't sound bad to my ear. However the CD case says ""AAD"" which means it was recorded analog, mixed analog, and transferred digitally. Is this new version ADD? (And I'm not asking about attention deficit disorder) In summation, how does the audio sound head-to-head with the 1990 Best-of? Already having these songs across several CDs, some of us would appreciate an opinionated appraisal of the sound quality vs earlier releases. Thanks. Rock on Bangles! I'll always love the electric inflection that pulses in Susanna Hoffs's singing voice. It's something really special... (I wish her vocals had been more prominent in the Doll Revolution songs rather than having her share singing duties) Thanks again!"
2,Coveside Bluebird House,"A well-constructed, properly dimensioned Bluebird house. It was a gift for my Mom, who can't wait for spring to see if the Bluebirds agree!"
2,Fantastic unit,"I use this thing every week. It works great and is highly accurate. Allows you to reach out to places impossible otherwise. Just how high is it from the footings to the brick freeze? Easy. Just place the tail of the laser on the footings and shoot the brick freeze. Whammo! 18'5"". Great.How far is it from this stepdown to that stepdown? Whammo! 16'8"". How far is it from this layout string to the footings? Whammo!Is this side of the porch header the same height as the other side of the porch. Shoot both sides, allowing the PLS1 to display the difference and whammo, you know if you need to level it or not.I could go on and on. Just cost too much."
1,Waste of Money,"Like many other parents I bought the whole DVD set hopeing that it would help my children. (3 and 20months) To my dismay these DVDs were very bad quality in deed. The graphics didn't attract my 3 year old son at all, and he barely watched for 5 minutes before running away. My 20 month old daughter watched for a little while but some of the odd graphics actually upset her to the point of tears. The alphabet DVD is too long and not visually appealing enough to make children of these ages want to watch. I strongly reccomend that if your child is near or over 2 years old, don't bother with these DVDs."
1,You love to roam? You will with this phone.,I have had this phone for almost 2 years. I am not very impressed. The coverage for the phone is horrible. The phone switches from analog and digital roam constantly. If I wanted to pay too much for service this would be the phone to use.
1,does nothing. scam scam scam,I used this product for more than a month. It did NOTHING. The reviews are all BS and this does not work. Save your money.
2,Hot Rollers do the job,"These hot rollers are great. Heat up very quickly, and the one size fits all clips work perfectly. Hair is ready to go in five minutes, start to finish."
1,As an Elizabeth George fan I am disappointed in her latest,"I was surprised and disappointed that George's work In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner left me totally bored, dismayed, and repulsed. It seemed to have little saving graces. I couldn't stand Tommy, his pompous inability to see beyond his own vanity was not the Tommy I knew and liked. Barbara is annoying in her hope that Tommy will come around - I wish she would have been less eager and forgiving when he finally did instead of excusing his bad behaviour. (note my English spelling). Because I have enjoyed all of the other novels so much I will look forward to reading the next one. I found the world of S&M not my cup of tea but I appreciate the author's bravery in showing us its degradations. No more of that please!"
2,Classic film,When I revieved this film I watched it straight away then about two weeks later it was on tv. These two writers in San Fransisco writing their collums for the festive season but they are arch rivels because they are writing for two different papers.One is a very big paper and the other is a small one but they are run by the same company.At the end the two papers are combined together and the arch rivels live happily ever after.
2,This should be on DVD!!,"This film comes from a time when Hollywood was not afraid to tell character-driven stories that touch the heart in strange and deep ways. Other reviews summarize the premise and plot of this excellent film quite well. So I'll just add my plea that someone, PLEASE remaster this and release it on DVD. It's too excellent a film to lose to tape decay."
2,Healthy glow,"After reading the positive reviews and tips about this foundation, I decided to try it. I'm glad I did, but also a little sad. Sad because it's NOT cheap and now that I've tried it, I just can't go back to using another foundation! It takes the red out of my skin and gives it a dewy, even glow. It's never cakey and doesn't settle into my lines. As others have said, use a brush and it will blend perfectly every time. Also, when spraying onto the brush, use quick little bursts, apply then spray another quick burst if needed. It really doesn't take much and you don't want to waste any. I probably wear this foundation 4 days a week, (in order to make it last longer). I really don't care about looking ""flawless"" when I'm running errands or working out! For those days, I just wear a tinted moisturizer (Sonia Kashuk from Target, is an excellent one).Almost forgot-this foundation does not make me break out as have many I've tried and it's a bit cheaper on Amazon than at Nordstrom's."
2,"Wesley Dennis, Country to the Core","On April 9th, 2005 Wesley Dennis and his bnad Country to the Core played at Alcazar Shriners for a 'Country Western Cookout' I was in New York State. On Monday April 11th, I received a report from my office assisant about the dinner/dance. I was told that the food was good the band was loud, but the singer was GREAT!! I knew that this would be the case as this is not the first time I have booked Wesley Dennis to play at Alcazar.I look forward to the next time I book Wesley for our place. I am listening to one of his CD's at the present. Excellent!!"
2,Sparks the imagination!,"I am so glad I discovered this book. My children enjoy telling a different story every time we open it. The fact that there are no words in it makes the children invent a new story each time, and I believe it develops their imagination better in a way, than with a storybook with pictures. I also like the art involved in this book, the minute details that the author/artist had included are adorable! I enjoy reading it myself! Each page reveals several goings-on in a small town, it is so easy to imagine yourself walking among the characters."
1,101 trees of indiana,"Too technical , does not use the commen names , does not show the limb paterns of tress , a booklet from Perdue will give more useful info for the person in the woods."
2,Excellent guide for teaching children about moral education.,"This is a great book if you're teaching children's spiritual education classes. Excellent reference. If you want to embellish the lessons for older children in the Ruhi 3 series, this book is the best way to do that."
2,Very satisfied,"The headset was exactly what I expected after reading previous reviews. The material is very thin and light - not something I would want to travel with. I have a large head, and the fit is very comfortable - very light on the ears. The sound is good, although I don't listen to quality music with them. The mike is two-way adjustable. Overall, I'm very satisfied."
2,Big haus,"This cot is big, way big, I mean you just can imagine how hugely, mid-bogglingly big it is!That being said, I have one issue, it rocks back and forth a bit when tossing and turning, otherwise it's very stable and super comfortable!"
1,Not A Good Method,This method is not very well organized and is not something a person trying to learn the blues with something that can help them grow along the way. There are a few things of use but not much for the price. The flashy dvd guitar playing is over done and not necessary. People buy this stuff so that they can learn and not something to watch someone else show them how good they are after years of playing. I would not recommend this to anyone but would advise them to look for something with better instruction and not just bits and pieces. Try something with a book/cd like the book by John Ganapes...Blues You Can Use. It is put together as a real teaching method.
1,A Return to Love far Surpasses this Latest Effort,I am beginning to wonder if this author and Donald Neale Walsch have something in common. They don't know when to stop and leave a prior miracle a miracle. I am very disappointed with this book by Marianne. It is like she didn't write anything new that hasn't already been written by her and written much more clearly in her first A Return to Love. This seems much more like her capitalizing on her reputation and duping those of us who truly thought she might have something NEW to say. A money making venture for her and a major disappointment for me. It appears to me it would have been much more honest of her to re-release A Return to Love than to dupe us with bits and pieces of already published work.
2,Get Your Tiki Party Going!,"Just when my ""grog log"" was beginning to fall apart in curacao-stained tatters, the Beachbum comes out with the new edition. Intoxica is even BETTER than the first. Timeless recipes and unending fun await. For anyone who wishes to delve into the world of exotic drinks, this is the BEST book that I've come across. In no time at all you will be mixing the most amazing and tasty concoctions in your own kitchen.You will never order a tropical drink at a bar again. Get This Book!"
2,A US Brit Cultural Experience,"Did not know what to expect from this video but being a US person owning old Brit iron I could not resist seeing it. The video is about the bike (only old Triumphs) but really it is more about the people who own them. Some of the people in this video are more likely to cut and chop the old brit iron than restore them to their original ""glory"" and that is simply less attractive to me than appreciating the bikes as they were. Not that it is right or wrong. The DVD is excellently done and the producers are to be congratulated."
2,A Winner from Wouk,"Tracking the life of young Margorie Mornigstar (nee Morgenstern), Wouk traces the conflicts of young love, religion, feminism, and the pace of the changing world in the mid-20th Century."
1,brianbot,"Brian sings wonderful old songs, but there is no heart or soul. Sounds like he is singing each song for the 1000 time, which he is."
2,If u get any reggae single..get this..tight!,"This single from Diana is what got people hooked onto her slick singing style of mixing reggae and R+b in one. If you want it smooth she can give it to you smooth and if you want it raw she can put it down just as good as patra or any other female reggae MC. All the remixes on this are good, but the stand out mix is the 2 dancehall mixes. The 5th track is just an instrumental extension of track 4. Track 4 is the track to turn up and ride to or play at a party. U didn't know? Well now is a good time to order this and see just what i'm talking about.Get it!"
1,MCSE Implementing and Supporting Web Sites Using Microsoft S,This is probably the worst MCSE Study Guide that I have ever purchased. Does the author even know about the subject? The examples are horrible and the content is horrible. People WILL NOT be able to pass the Site Server test after reading this book. This is the biggest waste of money. Please learn from my mistake and don't buy this book.
2,Great speakers for the price,"Plenty of mounting options. These sound crisp and clean. Good response on the mids. The his are clear. The innovative +3db button and directional tweeter are very useful for getting the right amount of hi where you want it. I don't get much bass from these (even considering they are 6.5""), but what bass response I do get is pretty tight. Others reviewers report decent bass, so it may be that I'm not pushing only 22 RMS each @ 4 ohms. Doesn't bother me though, as I've got a subwoofer for all my bass needs. I've already recommended them to a couple friends."
2,Pretty,My daughter will love this for Christmas. It's a traditional little girl's music box. It is much larger than I thought it would be though.
2,Great Smoke Taste,Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
1,Poor quality clay,The product looks nice and makes a nice present for grandparents. We had a heck of a time getting the clay to roll out evenly. The included rolling pin is a joke. The clay sticks to it so badly we just used our hands. We ordered a different one for ourselves that has a side each for the hand and foot separately. The clay in that set is vastly superior. The difficulty in using the clay would deter me from buying this or recommending it to others. Keep looking. It was really frustrating to use.
2,Go buy it!,"This is a great book,taking a new twist on an old sci-fi and fantasy classic; Angels.A very interesting twist, but I wont ruin the surprise ;)pick it up for yourself!.Especially if your tired of reading the same old things over and over.unique size and good paper will make this stand out on your shelves as well."
1,defective product,Unit operated for a day and a half. Even during this short time period the compressor was very noisy at startup and the fan sounded as if it was hitting something as it was speeding up. After this 36 hour period the unit would run for about 5 minutes and then just blow hot air. With so many other portable products available I would caution anyone thinking of buying this unit.
1,HORRIBLE,"Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen. So ridiculous. Horrible. Even if I wanted something that was a little goofy/ light-hearted, this is absurd. It just dumbfounds me that so many ""stars"" would participate in this, but I guess everyone has their price."
1,No Stan Bush?? That's lame.,No Stan Bush on this soundtrack? That's about as lame as Bumblebee being a freakin' camaro. This gets a zero.
2,Quinn is fabulous!,"I love books where the heros are morally ambiguous and maybe while they might have some noble motives, they are also admittedly selfish in their actions. Most authors will shy away from this, giving their hero(ine)s some honorable backstory about why they are stealing. Hooper doesn't do that with Quinn. He likes the challenge and he doesn't feel bad about stealing money from the rich. He's a fabulous character, though the backstory is somewhat convoluted. He charms you into falling in love with him, even when his motives and methods for doing what he does are no longer a mystery.For some reason Morgan just didn't seem to be much of a believable match for him. Hooper kept alluding to her brilliance, but there wasn't much evidence of it. She wasn't stupid by any means, but she didn't seem as smart as Hooper kept giving her credit.I won't ruin the ending, but it left enough loose ends open to leave me wanting more of Quinn. I want a third installment!"
2,The best book I ever read,I laughed all the way through this book. I can wait until his Comdey Central show comes out.
1,The Red Church,MMMMM. This isn't one of my favorite books. I like horror and supernatural novels but this on missed the mark with me.
2,doggy doors,"EVERYbody with a pet should have a doggy door. What a way to go :o). The only thing I wish is that it looked the same on both sides. The person who put mine in put a frame around the other side, doesn't look so good. It's in the garage though, so that's okay."
1,I don't like it,"disappointing, poor packaging, the pieces were coming loose inside the box and can not bear the weight of the pieces so broke. instructions for assembly are very poor. armed after the team has a lot of vibration"
2,Love it!,"I loved this pillow from the first night it arrived. What a difference from trying to use regular pillows bunched up next to you. I have used it every night for several months now. Even my husband loves it. Occasionally he will take an afternoon nap, and when he does, he sneaks away to the bedroom and snuggles into my contoured pillow! But I must admit, as I have gotten larger and am only 3 weeks from the delivery date, it is getting increasingly difficult to climb in and out of the pillow. But once I'm in, it's still super comfy! I highly recommend this pillow, depending on how large mom is, how large dad is and how large your bed is, because it does take up quite a bit of room."
1,Guess I'm not enough Deadhead,"'Cause I just can't ""hear"" this music.Garcia was a musical genius, but maybe this albumis a bit too self absorbed, for certain it's too advanced for me.For others maybe a hit, for me, a big miss."
1,STILL OVERPRODUCED BUT NOT HALF BAD,"Best Song: Moving OletaWorst SOng: SecretBiggest Let Down: I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels. (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!)Other Good Songs: If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely;Forgettable: Love Revival; Somebody;O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune.The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare. But the material here isn't half bad. ""Moving Oleta"" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for ""Song of the Year"". By far one of Reba's most moving performances!"
2,Thank you,It is good method and experiance to buy from youAnd i will buy alot of things from in the futuer
1,"Paratrooper: Tucker is Right. Scott, Parenti and Olds Cowered Under Fire.","I was there. Tucker is correct. Parenti has no call whatsoeverto write the bulljive smack he does in this book about MikeTucker. Ian Olds, Garrett Scott, and Christian Parenti allhid behind a gun truck in the middle of the day, on thatmission. 9 Jan. 04, Fallujah. I saw it. I was there. Thisparatrooper knows. And damn right, Mike Tucker has all theright in the world to set the record straight. And heis the only one who has returned to Iraq, in deep, to honorour warriors. Fitting that he does not cast any stones inhis books on war at journalists, because Tucker understandsthat journalists are not the story, the warriors are.A Paratrooper. Alpha Company, 1st - 505th, 82nd Airborne."
1,satanic drivel at its worst,"A relic of the Satanic Panic days of the early 1990's, this book should be consigned to a museum and NEVER read by anyone who doesn't understand that it is obsolete, out-moded, disproven and utterly bogus. If you do read it, pay special attention to the sections wherein the author discloses her lengthy mental health history. That explains the rest of the foolishness."
2,This Rocks,Paul has always been a classic along with Christy Moore. The recordings were well mastered and are great listening. Rock on!
2,As amazing as the first effort,"The first novel in this series, Altered Carbon, set up the story in Broken Angels. This writer has an amazing ability to mix prose and brutality, thoughtful introspection and all out mayhem. Scary what resides in our heads!!!"
2,The Best Album of the Year,"Every song on this cd is excellent , the 2 songs that can be heard on the radio ( heavy and run ) simply make it better , every song on this album is great . A must buy . A+."
2,stuntman,"this game is wicked!It has superb graphics, and is very easy to play.There are plenty of levels to play and the price is good value for money!!!"
2,A little disappointing,"The short ""season"" for shows such as this is frustrating. Still, we were disappointed more on the lack of consistency this ""season"" than the previous ones. When the relationships got so mixed up at one point, we considered giving up the show. We stuck through that and we were okay with the way this season 3 ended but we sure wish consistency in the storyline and characters would remain."
2,"CONVENIENT, EASY, and QUALITY ALL IN ONE!",This camera offers it all in a lightweight and compact camera. Canon has done a wonderful job with this one. I have taken it with me everywhere I go and it's so light you sometimes forget you have it. The quality of the pictures have also been excellent and I have had no problems with red eye. I liked it so much I just bought another for a friend. Excellent!
2,Excellent product for the price.,Completely satisfied. First night entertaining went really well. Would recommend it. Looking forward to putting a lot more use into this product.
2,Equal parts laughter and mystery,"If you haven't read Evanovich, don't start here--start with One and work your way up, because the character development is significant to the plots, and you just won't get as much enjoyment out of the book if you aren't acquainted with the characters and especially Stephanie Plum's relationship to them.Evanovich does not write rocket science, and her work will likely never be listed in the bibligraphy of anyone's doctoral thesis, but if you're headed for the beach, or have a quiet weekend ahead, take Ten along--you won't regret it."
2,Another year at Hogwarts... FINALY!!!,"Anyway, as ecpected, the fifth novel in the awesome Harry Potter series is to die for. If possible, I think this one highly overshines the others. I can't keep my nose out of this book for a second! (well... except for right now obviously)The plot in this book is HIGHLY developed. In my opinion, Harry seems more like a real person in this book. His personality is more defined and understandible. And he finaly TELLS PEOPLE OFF!! Even if it is the weird british way of telling people off. In my opinion, everyone, including his friends, finaly get what they deserve. (tho, he could yell more at teachers than at Ron and Hermione)And of course there is another wonderfly evil Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher. But I won't spoil anymore of the story here.Well... seeing to how typing this is cutting time away from reading the other half of the book, I'll just say this... This book was worth the ridiculous wait, and is the best one so far!!!13..."
2,A Helpful Treatment on a Relevant Topic,"For a long time I have been dismayed with the teaching that one may remain in known, deliberate, continual, and unrepentant sin--and still be saved. I have attempted to research the various forms of both conditional and unconditional security. In an attempt to be discerning and fair, I read Charles Stanley's book on Eternal Security. I was dismayed to learn that he would say that one may be saved by faith, but then fall from faith and become an unbeliever, and STILL remain in a saved condition. I think that Dan Corner's book on this teacher and teaching is both balanced and needed. He shows how Scripture refutes Stanley's ""once saved always saved"" position, and he explains how the word of God does teach security--a security that is conditioned on continued obedient faith. This small book should be supplemented with Corner's larger book on conditional security."
1,Quite disappointing,"I had never read one of Diane Ackerman's books so when I saw this well-reviewed in the NYT, I decided to check it out. As someone who's read a fair number of reflective garden books, I found Ackerman's prose weak and lacking in much real service. From a natural history standpoint, she wrote nothing that surprised me. I can't comment on how it compares to her previous work, but I can say that I wouldn't buy this book again."
2,review,"This product was as described, purchased for my 18 mo old grandson. The animals are small enough for him to hold in 1 hand. He and his brother had fun trying to hit the ""basket"". Would recomend to a friend."
1,Below Average book,"It is an ok book for B2B introduction. That is all it is worthwhile reading. Also, some of these information are somewhat outdated. Financial market is very different than electronics market for example. Sure some of the market fundamentals are similar (such as liquidity, and transaction level....), but the nature of the underlying assets is very different. Get an used one or borrow from someone for a quick reading.... I bought it brand new while visiting Hong Kong.."
1,worst money I ever spent!,I found this book bleak and depressing. I could not begin to identify with any of the characters. The only reason I gave it one star is because that's as low as the scale would let me go.
1,Hitler's Rise to Power,"Hitler rose to power when his book Mein Kampf, meaning My Struggle in English, became popular throughout Europe. He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke. Hungary was bought out during WWII and along with Austria was a big turncoat- Sweden remained a neutral country. I wasn't around during WWII, I don't know what it was like. Transylvania was bought out during WWII."
2,Brilliant and Vigorous,"This CD is one of the most energetic and seductive Middle Eastern, instrumental albums available. Michel Godard on Tuba and Nabil Khaiat on frame drums are regulars in the Abou-Khalil circle. Interplay is lively and thoughtful, fusing improvisational techniques of America and Arabia. If you like this look for: Arabian Waltz, Blue Camel or Al-Jadida. Wow!"
2,"GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON, but PRODUCT NOT THE GREATEST","This is a decent price for these refills, and the free shipping is definitely nice. My only problem with these packets is that they don't last very long. They have been lasting approx. 2 wks per pack - so that adds up. They just don't hold very much toothpaste. But the toothpaste that they do contain, the fresh mint, is very good - good tasting and goes well with the sonicare.PROS: Tastes good, good price.CONS: Doesn't last long."
1,crane fm antenna,"The crane fm antenna proved to be only slightly better than a 300 ohm dipole available from Radio Shack for about $3-$4.00. Keep in mind that the higher up on the wall you go or hung with string (to prevent interference) from a window shade cross member, the better your reception will be with any indoor dipole type antenna. Buy a dipole for $3-$4 and use the remainder for something else."
1,double dipping,Wait for the extended edition blu-ray. This release does not include extended editions. It is a total rip off. The studio is just trying to make a buck. I bet that they wait until The Hobbit is about to be released and then release the extended editions with a discounted movie ticket or something. But lets hope they don't wait that long. Don't give them your money for this p.o.s!
1,not cool,"Sam, the narrator, is consumed with being ""cool."" This indicates he clearly is not, and we have to assume the same about the author. A self-absorbed child who stalks his prey is about as interesting as a mashed potato sandwich. What crap! I didn't waste my time finishing it."
2,Not enough personal stories!!,"The one and only thing I absolutely HATED about this book was the way he'd jump back and talk about the conquistadors, etc...I have history books that will give me that info..you aren't offering anything new there, except perhaps your perception of those events...Tell me what it was like, what YOU saw in various truck stops, etc...Tell me MORE of it!! I wish I could just toss a bag into my car and take off."
2,Kinetic Great - Don't loose your Lens!!,"I love the EyeToy and Kinetic - great for someone like me who needs motivation, but does not like to leave the house and hit the gym.HOWEVER.... DO NOT LOSE the extra Lens that comes with Kinetic for the EyeToy as you can't get a replacement for it ANYWHERE! Sony has been NO HELP at all. And I just can't focus the camera without it. So very sad - so I am watching eBay for cheap versions of the game, just to get a replacement lens. They REALLY need to make this lens available as an accessory to purchase on it's own."
2,kicks butt (literally),"I'm a yoga instructor and will definitely be recommending this to students and fellow instructors! Because this is definitely, hands down, one of the best Yoga DVD's I've ever taken. The instruction is super clear and easy to follow, you could literally do it with your eyes closed. It's perfect for beginners, mid levels, and advanced. No matter what level you are, the 30 minute sequences put most hour-hour and a half work outs to shame! So whether you're looking to deepen your practice or get a good work out in, this will give you the chance to do both, guaranteed!"
1,ABC BLOCK BOOKS,The books are just the right size for my 9 month old but she wants to chew them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone whose baby likes to chew books. The books don't hold up. I also found the box they come in combersome for storing. I do like the images. I had to put these away for a later time.
2,A Book That Will Forever Change Your Life!,"As the President/CEO of HowYouMakeMillions.com and EmpowerMag.com, I'm always looking for books that will expand my consciousness, renew my spirit and answer key universal questions that have eluded me for years.Robert Pino's book, Absolute Victory has given me those answers and deepened my sense of awareness. You can never go back to the way you use to think when you read this book by an author I simply called The Alchemist. He will lift the lead from your life and help you manifest gold!"
1,No Snaps!,Product says it comes with snaps to hold the pad to the table. No snaps in the box. When I called to complain I got the runaround and no help at all. Lousy customer service.
2,"BUY THIS ALBUM, SUPPORT SKA-CORE",Just a beautiful CD. This is the kind of genius that comes from Tomas Kalnoky and his bandmates. Catch-22 isn't good anymore because he left. Catch-22's loss is Streetlight Manifesto's gain in this cd.
2,See this movie,"Everyone should see this movie. I saw the cover and waited to purchase as it is not what I gravitate toward, but saw it and passed it on to many to watch. I see why it had everyone talking and being shown everywhere. We need more movies like this today. Thank you, Alex Kendrick and crew!"
1,"Lots of plastic, not much color","Disappointed that it's so much smaller than it looked and the center plastic part seems to be about 95% of the toy. Grandson likes it, but can't use it without getting the opposite color on his hand. Clever idea, but not well executed."
2,Brilliant!,"I loved the tenor of the writing and the atmosphere of this book. I thought it outstanding. The negative reviews I have read seem to come from people who prefer the straightforward, ""tidy"" detective novel. I was not bored at all, and found it very engaging. Yes, there were numerous what some called ""loose ends,"" but I do think that such was intentional. Not everything turns out to be what is expected nor does everything turn out to be relevant. I, frankly, am a bit intrigued about where the fig came from . . . must we be told? Or can we not stretch back in our chairs and wonder?"
2,You can't go wrong with a horse!,"I went and saw Hilago last night and really enjoyed the movie! In fact, I had been looking forward to seeing the movie since December 5th of last year. I can truly say that this movie was worth the wait.I love horses, so any movie that centers around a horse is worth seeing to me. Hidalgo will rank on my list of horse movies to own, just like Seabiscuit, Black Beauty, and Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken.Viggo Mortensen gave a wonderful performance as Hopkins(and whether the western legend is true, Mortensen has my respect). Mortensen brought Hopkins to life in a way few could have done it.When it comes to Hidalgo's performance, I'm speechless! I have great respect for the trainer, but even greater respect for the horse! I agree with someone else who said, ""Hidalgo should win an award for his performance.""There were a few slow parts, but overall it's a keeper:) I did my share of crying and was caught up in the moment. Thanks Disney, you've done it again!"
2,GREAT ALBUM!,"I THOUGHT P WAS DONE FOR AFTER THE RELEASE OF ""ONLY GOD CAN JDGE ME"" BUT HE REDEEMS HIMSELF SLOELY BUT SURELY ON THIS ALBUM. THIS IS NO LIMIT'S BEST THIS YEAR!!"
1,continous misfortune,"I love all features of this camera, pictures are beautiful, it is easy to take them, but... There is no way I can use it now - it has some electrick shortcut in it that makes battery to overheat while not in use, burns it out after couple shots, lens gets stuck in open position. I sent it for repair since it is still on manufacturer's warranty and they returned it to me not working at all after 1.5 months of wait. First - do not rely on warranty. second - if you buy - check that you cna take more than 10 pictures at a time - that has been maximum I could do. If light is low than about 3 - before so called repairs..."
2,Versatile and useful,I use it with my Leatherman Wave. It fits nicely in the Leatherman sheath. It holds its setting. You can't take your car apart with it but its great for small jobs.
2,Invacare Manual Wheelchair Review,"Great wheelchair for a great price. Only thing I would have wanted to know before purchase was if the foot rests were able to be adjusted updward (they do not), and if the seat will last (not sure it will)."
1,"Wasted money on this product, fleas are happy","We have two dogs and two cats. The product has done absolutely nothing to control the fleas. Plus, my older my cat had an allergic reaction on her neck. The fleas have moved into our house and will not leave! Cannot wait until I can apply Advantix, a product that actually works. Save your money everyone!"
1,It worked great until it died...11 months after I bought it,"I bought this because the manual frothers are messy and the battery operated chargers quickly slow down as the batteries wear down. I was careful to follow all the recommendations from other reviewers, including letting the battery run down before recharging. I loved the speed and creamy froths...until yesterday, when it refused to recharge. Now it seems my only option is to throw it away. If it had replaceable rechargeable batteries, I would give it 5 stars, but why make something that has to be thrown away after only a few months?????"
2,WONDERFUL,"I'm not really a movie buyer but this is one movie that I had to go out and buy! Fraser and Weisz are a great team. Im in love w/ this movie. You wont be dissapointed with this movie. I watch it everyday! Im a little obsessed with it! Its all I think and talk about. I have the book too, its also good! This movie is amazing. The comedy is great so are the special effects!WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! I can truly say that I loved this movie and I think YOU will too. Its not a waste of money, AT ALL!"
1,Rip Off!,"Two songs - are you kidding? And one of them was BAAAD! So if you put a dollar value on the good one, this is the biggest rip off!"
2,Excellent!,Works just like one would expect a non-stick omelet pan to work -- things don't stick. :-)
1,"Boring, Corny and Predictable","This movie was not good. Not good at all. I even watched this movie a couple of times, just to give it another chance and both times regretted it. It seemed like both characters were trying too hard to act, the lines were corny as well as alot of the scenes. I think I would have liked this movie better if they had different actors for the main characters. Jennifer Lopez is a ok actress, the only movie I have really ever liked her in was Selena. Matthew McConaughey is an overrated actor, even though I think he is quite handsome he is seriously lacking in he acting skills department."
2,INTEX 66705,"My first one lasted for over a yr, without a problem. Then it created a leak that I could not find . But this was my only bed so Iwas not upset with that. So I bought another one and its fine. Now that I have a real bed I only use it for a spare. They are great beds and they last a long time . I'm looking to buy another for my niece, cause she has no bed.Great product by Intex...Thank you."
2,Outstanding,"I disagree with marsneptune, who only gave this 2 stars. I think this is a fantastic album...I'd say it sounds exactly like what would happen if Brian Eno and syd Barrett produced a Warren Zevon album, or if Joe Walsh had Pink Floyd backing him: a beautiful blend of folksy simplicity with incredibly tasteful and brilliant production, moving vocals, intelligent lyrics. It's right up there with ""Another Green World"" in my book, and that's saying a whole heapum lot.This album will definitely appeal to fans of early Roxy Music, Bowie, or rock musicals like Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Rocky Horror, and Velvet Goldmine. An essential document of the times."
1,Disappointed in Amazon,I can't believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?
1,As The Universe Turns,The first half is interesting. The second half is written as if the author is being paid by the word.
2,Great Foodsaver,I have had this machine for about 2 years and had trouble free operations. Could have a faster seal cool off system for faster operation but satisfied the way it is.
2,Fresh Approach,"This is one of the most unique Steel Guitar projects ever recorded. From Country to Mexican, from waltzes to Hawaiian and Movie Themes, there's a little bit of everything, played with musical mastership. Who ever thought about the Star Trek Theme being a Steel Guitar instrumental? Kayton Roberts' version of ""Bells Of St. Mary"" is simply beautiful, the whole recording mixes styles so well that listening to the record is pure pleasure."
2,Practical,"No nonsense guide to the art of writing. Witty, humorous and straightforward, no fluffy wordisms that plague the writing of today. Loved it."
2,A Good Introduction,"This book combines readability with good content, being one of the most often selected introductions to logic and critical thinking on the university level, it obviously holds a great deal of merit."
2,It does the job but...,"Pros: The Culligan HSH-C135 was really easy to install. I didn't even need to call the plumber or a handyman to replace my old showerhead. From the picture, there aren't many components to snap the filter and shower head. My old shower head also uses a flexible hose so that it was just a matter of unscrewing off the old one and screwing the new one in. It was also nice that a teflon was provided that I don't have to go out buy one. The water that comes out has nice clean feel to it. When I get off the shower, it doesn't feel like there are still some suds left.Cons: Because the water has to go through the filter, much of the pressure gets reduced. The same amount of water comes out but the direction is more downward than really spraying out. I tried fiddling with the settings. Sadly, I couldn't improve the water flow."
2,Good,"This book is less an autobiography than it is a memoir of dealing with cancer. The entire book is pretty much about the nitty gritty details of cancer, which could prove a valuable comforting resource for those going through something similar. Wish there had been more about her life and career. But it's pretty much all about cancer and Gene Wilder, whom she obviously adored. I like that it feels like you can hear her voice when you read--it sounds like her and can be very funny and touching. She seems like a great person and someone you would have loved to know as a friend."
1,What a nightmare ! Don't do it !,"After much research - I took the plunge - and plucked down [money] for this thing. What a mistake ! Musicmatch software syncing to IPOD was awful - with dropouts - and transfers in which you had no idea whether the songs were transferring or not. There is no visble indicator of song transfer ! Then I tried Ephpod after reading some reviews - it just caused XP to freeze. Believe me, I put computers together as a hobby - and this thing was a big mistake. Don't spend your money ! Poor software & too expensive - even with the 10GB ! I'm returning mine - last Apple I ever own !"
1,Good? Yeah Right!,"I am the biggest fan of Iron Man, but this book was very disappointing! I am a huge fan of the comics and when I read this book i felt that the writers just didn't even try to write a good book. There was too much action and not enough plot. The writers did not bother to describe the charactors. The story did not have enough of the main charator [Iron Man] and focused more on War Machine and Caption A. The story was loose and had too much going on at once. The book jumped around and didn't stay with the charactors."
2,Forest of the dead!,"Great zombie flick lots of suspence, twists and blood. 28 Days Later in the forest!"
2,fun,"my daughter was so excited to get this scooter she cant wait to ride it it shipped very quickly and looking forward to a lot of fun,"
2,"Works Perfectly, Easy to Install","Within 15 minutes of receiving this card I had my local area network up and running between two computers. Admittedly, I was looking to do something very simple: two computers, side by side, connected with an RJ45 cable (not included with the card). The drivers included on the CD-ROM work fine with Windows 98. My only complaints are that the card sticks out of the PCMCIA slot about an inch and that if you remove the card and reinsert it the card needs to reinstall (a simple process). I bought this card as a cheap test to see if I could set up a simple network before trying to tackle a wireless network. I am so satisfied that I will probably buy D-Link wireless hardware."
1,Too many quirks spoil the broth,"Although not a bad writer, Brenchley cannot easily fit his tale of mysterious amnesia with his tale of an ambiguous angel; it was as if Buffy the Vampire Slayer and NYPD Blue decided to air a crossover episode--the genres are just too different to be a good fit unless handled brilliantly, which is not here the case.I myself found the mystery angle compelling, and was annoyed when the angel angle intruded. This wasn't enough to put me off his work entirely--this was an interesting attempt by a writer new to me--but I can't recommend it as a satisfying read.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
1,Step away from this book,"If you like gratuitous vulgarity and an unengaging attempt to insert an intellectual backdrop over a lame story, you'll love this book."
1,poor quality screwdriver set,"I needed a good quality hardened steel screwdriver set to take my camera apart and bought the above set as it was labelled as a ""jewelers"" screwdriver set. Well,jewelers use hardened steel and the steel on this set is as soft as 2 hour old macaroni. The first screwdriver I used twisted out of shape on the first turn, the 2nd one twisted out of shape too, neither would loosen the screws. I sent it back to the manufacturer and they quickly credited my account."
1,Disappointing mistakes throughout the book,"What a disappointment. I'm taking the test tomorrow, and I fear for my grade. Having worked with Oracle8i since its release, I was just looking for a quick read to brush up on the breadth of topics in the exam, and get reaquainted with the exam style for the Oracle tests. Boy I sure started with the wrong book. The amount of technical errors are astounding, particularly in the exam questions! In addition, the exam questions are poorly written and do not appear to have any relation to the style I will expect on the test. Wish me luck, and steer away from this title."
2,A Great Motivational Book. Well worth it!,A very enjoyable read. Having the stories about the sports stars interwoven into the text made it a lot of fun and is a great way to illustrate the principal being discussed. I really liked the summarization at the end of each chapter. I've even taken some of the of bullets from the chapter reviews and put them on a bulletin board at work to motivate the group of employees I manage at Boeing. I strongly recommend this book for everyone but feel it's especially valuable for young adults about to enter the real world or anyone starting their own business.
2,Excellent Approach to Science and Religion,"The assertion presented in this book that science and religion are not only compatible but need each other is right on the mark. Moreover, Khursheed's daring statements about scientific discoveries in areas such as physics enjoy greater acceptance now than in the 1980's when the book was published and continue to be just as timely."
2,Disturbing and overwhelming,"I deeply enjoyed the first album but it had a number of catchy tracks (Hitler in my Heart, The Rapture, Blue Angel) that pulled me in. As previous reviews have mentioned, ""I am a Bird Now"" takes a turn to the low-key, but the album more than surpasses his first effort. A skeleton of song and voice, this album is powerful, disturbing and incredibly overwhelming. One listen will not suffice, give it some time, you'll fall in love."
2,Moog- a trusted company,"Much beefier than the stock links on my 2003 Mercury Marauder. Moog has a good name to it, and now I see why."
2,THE BEST REVIEW READ READ,"alright lets get started. i am going to give you a honest opinions in the shipping and as well the game itself.Shipping: I got my package on the first day of the estimation date. It was packaged decent enough in a white envelope type thing, with paper for cushioning.Game: The game was in pretty well condition. There were to my surprise no scratches on the disc whatsoever.Game-play: the game itself is pretty fun, even though i am only on the 3rd level. there are a bout 20 levels that last about 25 minutes each. YOu can use your sword and fire powers to defeat enemies. The bosses were one of the best parts of the game also.Overall, pretty good game, not the best, but if you can get it for a decent price i say go for it!"
2,Great gloves,These are the best gloves I have come across for roofing. These gloves have outlasted all others. Dexterity and grip is good. Wearout is great as these kind have been in use daily for two months before the finger tips wear out. In a roofing enviroment that is great!
2,I've read it over 3 times and it gets better every reading,"I was reccomended this book in 5th grade, I'm now in 8th. When I read it then I only skimmed it and loved it, in 6th grade I picked it up again and read it to my favorite CD (311, self titled). Now every time I listen to that CD I remember a part of Enders Game. I can't wait until the movie comes out."
1,Mark Twain this is not,"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point. Kerry Shale will have you absolutely spleeping through passages that would have you in a belly laugh if you were reading it yourself. And his interpretation of Mark Twain's characters is only adds to the boredom. Just because they talk in local dialect, and have predjudices and superstitions, does not mean that they are all ignorant buffoons. Mark Twain is hillarious and some narrators will have you peeing in your pants listening to his books. Pass this one by."
1,"Cheap product, bad vendor","This product sounds like a good idea, and maybe somewhere is a good idea. But this is not the one to buy. I purchased two pairs, one tore the very first time I wore them. Getting a response from the vendor and replacement pair took weeks of constant follow-up. I'm pretty sure if I had been less persistent they simply would have screwed me out of the cost of that pair. The second pair began falling apart a couple weeks later, but at that point I was not about to deal with the vendor again. If you want gel wraps I recommend looking into other brands - these Everlast one are cheaply made and not worth your money. Even better, just stick with the traditional hand wraps, which I am back to after this experiment. Don't recommend,"
1,Leaker!,"I bought this canteen with high hopes for all my other Stanley products have been fantastic. However, this product is horrible! The very first time it was filled with water, it leaked at the round hole where the two different plastics met. I wanted to get a refund from Stanley but their site would not allow me to the correct area and it would have cost me as much to send it back as I had paid for it, therefore, I tossed it away and will never buy one of these again."
1,No No Nanette,I have had a better product at one time. It got lost in the shuffle of my moving. I hoped this would be a good replacement . It definitely has not been. Disappointed is what I got.
1,"Will not seat to toilet tank, and leaks around valve.","Model includes two different gasket for the large nut connection to the toilet tank. Neither one provided a tight seal. With either, moving the hose slightly causes leaks around the gasket. Do not purchase this product.Update: They gave us a free replacement, but we just tried installing it, and it leaks around the factory installed joints around the valve. An excellent product if you want slow, accumulated water damage to your home."
1,Screw up,Ordered a printer at the same time as the cables. The cables were back ordered. Got the printer with no problem. The mailing label for the cables had my billing city & zip code instead of shipping city & zip code so USPS could not findnthe address & sent it back. Guess no one had a phone!
2,Great light reading,"Robert Lanham does what he does best by lampooning this particular genre of characters. The book reads quickly and keeps interesting thoughout. While it is a bit out of date at this point, most people with a pop culture sense will be able to get a kick out of it, or perhaps even pick up on a band, book, or movie or two in some of the books lists. I also recommend picking up the other works by Lanham if you enjoy this book."
1,What the......?,"Why do both of these reviewers say they can't wait for ""Devil Within 2""? Sounds very fishy to me. Even if they liked it (which I find hard to believe), it's almost like they know what's coming and want to promote it. Hmmmm....sounds like they might have been involved in this flick from the start. Beware!!!"
2,"Finally, A Good Alien Environment!","Most film makers cheat on sci-fi by trying to make us believe that a desert scene with a colored gel taped to the camera should pass muster as another planet. Twohy goes the extra mile here, creating believable outdoors scenes, good characters, and great monsters. A real winner that will hopefull put the makers of the Alien series on their toes."
2,SMOOTH CHRISTMAS OFFERING,Wynnona's first solo Christmas collection is a pleasant addition to your holiday collection. Wynnona's voice is strong and controlled with supportive musical arrangements.The highlights: a haunting O COME O COME EMMANUEL and an emotional IT'S THE MESSIAH showcase her vocal excellence.
1,Warning about buying HD DVD movie,This came nicely in original packaging however does not work in the DVD or blueray player.
2,Excellent Product,I've been using this product for last few months. Audio & Video quality is better than other VCR model. Worth while spending..
2,The shining rocks!!!,"Excellent item ,great picture.Quality is awesome.An old classic presented the way it should be.Totally worth its money"
2,Action packed. A must for Han Solo fans.,"This book was beautiflly writen. i want Han and Bria get together soooooooo bad, and they finnlly did. this book was great, the best of all three."
2,Dragons of Winter Night,"I really enjoyed this book. This book had all the makings of Dragons of Autumn Twilight (the book before this one in the chronicles) and more. The reason this book was even better was the characters were not constricted to just one group, they were spread throught the world of Krynn. The group has even greater and more perilous adventures in this book because they are split up and out numbered. In their adventures they meet up in the end and join for the next sequal.You shoud really read this book and enjoy all the wonder of Krynn just a was privaliged to."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers."
1,"Great price and condition, terrible book","The seller did their job, it was in great condition and a great price, but the problem with this is that the material is just ridiculous, I may venture to say it is one of the worst reads I have ever had."
1,Don't even THINK about it!!,"Wow, I don't think that I have ever been this disappointed by a mail order item before. The case is really poorly constructed. It is two thick pieces of plastic. I couldn't get the two parts to stay together. It is really was low-rent compared to the very nice iPod itself. It reminded me more like product packaging than an actual product. This probably costs $1 to manufacture. I bought a lovely iSkin at a local Apple store. Which is an excellent alternative."
1,Not so good,"Buy these from Private Island on Amazon instead of this seller. They are much better quality and are packaged properly for lens protection.These sunglasses came in a large carton, with little protection material. They were floating around the box in a plastic baggie.I ordered two pair. Both came with scratched lenses and a damaged frame hinge. I don't know if it was because of the way they are packaged. They may be just poor quality from the manufacturer."
2,"I'm Head Over Hooves For ""The Horse Whisperer""!","This book sank deep into my heart. The passion that can exist between two people is amazing, once you find it. This story stirs the emotions of the heart. I'm not one to cry, buy as I finished it, I felt something. It stayed with me for days, I can't even explain it. It was forbidden, everything natural that the characters felt for eachother was overruled by responsibility and priority. Just read this book, then you'll know."
1,Will NOT help you pass actual test...,"Studied the book thoroughly, got 55 and 52% on REA tests in this book, then took an OFFICIAL CLEP test and got only 44%. Took the actual test and didn't pass; got only a 47% almost nothing covered in REA book was on the questions. If anything you need an additional textbook to study with to be able to pass. All the other REA books so far got me through but this one didn't. Sorry REA, you need to go into more detail for this test..."
2,This is great!,"This is actually a fun book. The best part is the audio CD that has a spirit guide meditation led by Sylvia. Sure her voice sounds like she's either been gargling acid or she smokes too many cigarettes, but the meditation , if you're in your right mind ACTUALLY WORKS! This is a must-read for any Sylvia fan."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"2 stars may be a bit harsh--but I was sooooo disappointed. His Holiness the Dalai Lama does not need Howard Cutler as an interpreter -- his ideas are elegant and eloquent -- and can stand beautifully alone in their simplicity. From the cover, I thought the Dalai Lama wrote the lion's share -- but Cutler was entirely too present to satisfy me."
1,Not for touch typist,Note that there is an extra key between where one positios their right hand over the letter j and the enter key. Very frustrating for touch typists. I threw it out!
1,E3 error code,"This phone SUCKS! We spent a good $100 on this phone and all it does now is just display an E3 error message and all the lights blink. I suspect it has to do something with the circuits but I am not quite sure. Either way if you want your phone to last for a long time and be reliable, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE! Panasonic really screwed up this time and I would hope they do something about this because this seems to be quite a frequent problem."
1,buyer beware,"This Tweezer is a fake. It isn't comparable to my several other Tweezermans. It actually doesn't even as work as well as a drugstore tweezer. Also, this tweezer arrived without a box. It came in a single plastic tube and not a regular blue box like Tweezermans come in."
2,GREAT book!!,Book in near pristine condition even though it's over 50 years old. A very pleasant surprise and a great purchase.
2,Easy to use - recommended for med length hair,I was able to make a cute updo in about 10 seconds. Very versatile.
2,Works as advertised--wished I'd waited for pricedrop!,"Works as advertised. Used our ""learning remote"" to program on/off and channel settings. Allows top notch video viewing from DVD/PS2/Wii.Owned 2 months now, no issues.."
1,Not as good as expected,"Our pics taken with this camera on the first sunny days of the spring turned out very washed out and flat. They were so underexposed that later software modification on the computer could not entirely bring them to acceptable contrast. Pictures were not sharp enough. Enlarging pics to full size on the computer revealed annoying color casts similar to those seen on frames transfered from digital video tapes. camera is very heavy, not convenient for lengthy hiking trips. battery life is good though. all in all we are very dissapointed with nikon d50."
2,Just for the fun of it.,"Whereas Jake Shimabukuro is a master at showing what a uke can do using shock and awe, Gerald Ross shows what a uke should do by playing very pleasurable music."
1,Pitbulls are not good pets,"I love animals and bought this book thinking it would share some heartwarming stories about rescued dogs and the situations that arise when they enter your life. What I got was a book about Pitbulls. The flap (very misleadingly) says the book contains stories about all kinds of dogs but in reality this book is only about Pitbulls. I'm not sure why anyone would want to own a Pitbull,even your homeowner's insurance may cost you more as a Pitbull (or Rottweiler) owner, and the breed is statistically proven to have an aggressive behavior. One section of the book describes a situation where 2 dogs get into a vicious fight and the author has to intervene. That is not a ""pet"" I would want my children or friends or neighbors around. I was very disappointed in this book and felt it was lobbying to entice people into owning a vicious animal and consider it a pet.On the other hand, if you want a good book with heartwarming stories, read ""What the Dog Did""."
1,Cliched & Hackney,"Nothing original, along with poor writing and character development. Too bad, because it could have been so much better. Save your money and your time."
2,Gotta get this!!,"The first release 'Stay Gone' is the best song. I immediately fell in love with it, and I recommend this album for any true country music fan!"
1,Horrible....Don't Shop!!!!!!,"I should have known better to rent this movie when the book seemed so dull. However, I thought with Steve Martin in it, maybe it would be ok. WRONG.This movie is AWFUL. It is boring, the characters are bland and weird, the story is so blah it is virtually nonexistent. Its just plain creepy that Steve Martin is having sex with this young woman ( and she is ok with it, ewwww). His character is just as noninteresting as everyone else's. Thank God we didn't see him naked.Don't waste you time on this one."
2,All-Around Good Album,"I'd just like to put my two cents in and say that I thought this was a pretty good album. Reggie Young, who played with Waylon Jennings in the 1970s and 1980s, plays some great guitar on this CD, and if some of the lyrics are a little weak (I have to agree with the other reviewer who found ""God Must Be A Woman"" to be a bit theologically off-putting), the music more than makes up for it.I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to call it one of the greatest albums of all time, but I like it. If you like good, solid country music with a little bit of rock mixed it, you may like it, too."
1,Poor to say the least,"Nothing scientific about it...poor, conjecture and as usual no evidence,,a lot of silly not worth while to buy, I like my money back"
2,Lackawanna Blues. Bravo Zulu!,"Highly recommended DVD. I'd of recommended it as a Christian DVD, except for a stupid needless sex scene in an auto near the beginning of the movie.Lackawanna blues takes you through caring, love, tolerance, hate, bewilderment, and finally to redemption, caring again, and understanding. Excellent film! I cried during 50 percent of it!The old black lady 'Nanny' did an extraordinary job in this HBO Special; she deserves an Emmy! Bravo Zulu! And praise be to the Lord Jesus! I can't believe how old Louis Gosset, Jr got so suddenly..."
1,UFC Classics Vol. 1,A lot more talking and other filler thanactual fighting action. This would makea great thirty minute video if edited downto the actual action.
1,Is This Book A Joke?,"Love vitamins? Love tanks?? LOVE TANKS !?! Oh, please... I am so glad I borrowed this book from the library. They can have it back."
2,Wonderful resource,"I am a Pre-K teacher and this is a wonderful, multicultural matching game that my kids love to play again and again. A wonderful diversity resource."
2,Finally an antenna that works!,"I love this antenna! I saw the price and thought what could it hurt and the reviews on it looked great. I had recently purchased a Phillips Brand Antenna and it did not work well. I spent a pretty penny on that one and it got very little channels and I constantly had to move it.When the antenna came it was really small, smaller then I expected and it looked cheap to me. As soon as i attached it to the converter and scanned channels it picked up over 30 channels. The picture on each channel were clear almost like cable channels and I had to only move it once to get all the stations to stay clear. It fits perfectly behind my tv.Only downside is when the weather is bad or its windy it slightly falters but that is to be expected. To me its the little antenna who could, perfect."
1,Insert Batman to sell comic books,"Wow what can I say about this graphic novel... I honestly didn't like this book, but just because I didn't like this book doesn't mean I can give it a 1 star. It was a book, it had color and technically it was completed. After reading this book I felt like the author's just wanted to shock me. It didn't feel like a true batman story, and the ending was a joke. I don't want to give anything away, but the way they made Harvey look in this book was horrible. Took his coin away and moved him Tarot cards, give me a break.On the extra content, it's nice to have, but it's completely unneccesary. Infact after reading through it I was certian that the author was just trying for the shock and aww effect."
2,Reusable dry disc filter,"These are very good filters, especially for reusable. Easy to put on, hold up well in washing and last a good while. I am on my second order of these. And will be buying more. A good price for the product and good service."
2,Great read on Ohio River History,This is a well done account of the history of the Ohio Valley. It is raw but factual and keeps you turning the pages. A great read.
1,The cinematography was nice...,"I can allow for an incredible amount when it comes to movies, but it still didn't help me to enjoy this one. I know that this film wasn't meant to be taken as high art, but I couldn't even stomach it as a parody. The only things I did like about it were the beautiful scenery, camera angles, and some of the comedy. Waaaaay too much slow mo - take all that out and its running time wouldn't last 45 minutes, and seeing as how it only has about 5 minutes worth of story, you'd better heat up some popcorn.I love films of the nature that ""Six-String Samurai"" represents, and I can at least admire the concept, but its execution was horrible."
2,"relax, it's vic","'merriment' and 'mighty monkey' are instantly classic vic songs. those who already like vic will enjoy this album, it's one of the better ones, very subdued vic, very piano, very mellow, sometimes very sad. some great vic melodies herein, even some beatles sounding background harmonies. great stuff, the one disappointment being that it's ten songs and only thirty minutes long. other than that, it's near perfect vic. another golden chesnutt if i may say."
1,0 stars,"Disappointed. This book is worthless. The author should not try to write a book while smoking dope. The first half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial. The last half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial. Yes, I know the Mac-is-great, I love the Mac, Macs are cool, Macs are usefull, rah rah rah. Unfortunately, the book is content free. No actual developers were involved in the production of this book; no actual developers were informed by reading this book."
1,What's the point,"There is an occasional insight here, but ultimately this book is embarassing. You know that horrible scene in Bittersweet Motel with the two guys sitting talking about the difference between girls who ride in the jeeps and girls who ride in the microbuses? Imagine if those people went on tour and wrote a book about it."
1,"Poorly Coated, but Worth It if You Find it On Clearance","The size is perfect for the Black and Decker Countertop Convection oven Model T01675W. (This model can hold a 9 inch pie pan or cake pan.)There is plenty of room for the heat to circulate around the sides of each ""pan"" in this set.However,I found, like other reviewers, that the non-stick coating is poorly/cheaply applied. Only after a few uses and washings it started to come off.(And I did not scrub it hard and only used a soft sponge.)Since I found this identical set at Marshalls for $10, I still consider it worth the money as the Black and Decker parts would have cost me 4x as much (plus S/H). However, I would not pay the $16-$20 that Amazon has been and currently is charging for it."
2,Why can't the DVR do these things?,"I had Ultimate TV for over 12 years and it finally stopped working and since I had no idea where to purchase a new one (was informed it was no longer on the market) I had to resort to a DVR. I am so very unhappy with this new setup. The Ultimate TV makes the DVR look like the Bastard Stepchild. It only records one program at a time. I does not have the capacity to remind you or automaticaly change the chanel when another program comes on you want to watch and navigating the remote takes a Phd in rocket science. On the Ultimate TV everything was very compact and concise.One or two buttons on the remote and you had the info. you were looking for, usually all in one place. And, of course, you cannot access the inernet with the DVR. I simply cannot understand why this product had such a short shelf life. It's one of the best things I've ever owned."
2,excellent knife,This is one of the best pocket knives I have. It is excellent quality. I have several pocket knives and this is one of my favorites. Sog has a lot of good knives. I have had a great experience with Sog knives.
1,Doesn't work for me,There are other products with the same principal ingredient. I heard recommendations for this product but it has never done anything to improve razor burn/bumps for me.
2,Jack the ripper indeed...,Well I did not order this cd but one day i got this cd in mail and to my suprise i had already added it to my wishlist hummmm...anyways this band is just weird okay very dark and weird but in a very good way. I love this cd. And normally i dont care for british music but for some reason this stands out above all. EVERY song is great and full of wacko/dark vocals.
2,Excellent,"Loved it. Definitely one of the best academic treatments of Lilith out there. HOWEVER, I will tell you that there are a number of instances in this book where I feel that Hurwitz is trying to make direct literary comparisons and/or character associations to Lilith without sufficient evidence. I'm not saying he is wrong in ALL of these comparisons, but I do think that there are times when he doesn't sufficiently support his claims.All in all...an excellent piece of work.I definitely recommend it!"
2,works amazingly well,"I've gone through more pc game controllers than I care to admit and gotta say this one is AWESOME. First off, the design is great, and works well for everything from old arcade games to first person shooters and fighting games. Additionally, the wireless has been flawless for me once I got it set up right...I ordered 2 off amazon and didn't realize you only needed one receiver for up to 4 controllers. Once I unplugged the extra receiver both controllers worked great with no interference. I also have a g7 wireless mouse, a wireless router and a wacom tablet (I think they all use 2.4 ghz) and have no issues with them or any dropped connections. I use the controllers for my home theater setup that's about 20 feet away through 2 walls and this causes no issue."
2,Plenty of room for high resolution photos...,We went with the 8 gb memory card for our new Canon XSi DSLR and have no regrets. We are able to shoot at the highest quality setting and have enough room on the card to shoot worry free. The writing time is great and we are shooting away to our hearts content.
2,"Canadian disc, not too much of an issue","Like title says, it's a Canadian disc but that just means it says ""Herós"" in smaller letters in some spots. Takes a bit longer to load on my USA NTSC Panasonic Blu-ray player, but it warns you of that. After the initial load, the rest plays fine, no pauses in scene transitions. Transfer is pretty good for a film that's over 10 years old. Trust me, this film is worth Blu-ray. If you've never seen it, the color schemes are just brilliant and look beyond beautiful in enhanced quality. Shipping took about a day or 2 extra but for $8 and change, I can't complain."
1,Sounds like old records!,"It's amazing to me how the reviews to date on this terrible disk include several fives! Although there are many selections included, including the Diamonds' greatest hits, many of the selections are apparently recorded directly from someone's old records. On modern equipment the fidelity is just awful. If you enjoy this fine 1950's group, you will be most disappointed."
2,A must read.,"I really enjoyed this book. This is a must read for anyone that enjoys reading about hunting in Africa. I did find that there were repetitions, slightly modified of events that took place In ""Karamojo Safari"" but they are just a few. For the most part you wont want to put it down. This is like looking through a window into the past of a Africa that no longer exists."
2,CUTE,"When I listen to this album, the word ""cute"" comes to my mind. I am a huge Hilary fan, and absolutely love her music. This CD, however, was recorded over two years ago. When comparing Santa Claus Lane to her latest release, the difference is astounding. Now she has a much stronger, deeper, and more talented voice. I still listen to this CD for Christmas, because even with her voice being high pitched and more digitallized, she still is far more tollerable than the whiny groan of Celine Dion. I would buy this CD for the 8 - 15 age group. If you are looking for Hilary's developed, natural vocal talent, go for the self-titled ""Hilary Duff"" instead."
2,"""The laughs just keep on coming""","Season 5 of ""All In The Family"" had some memorable episodes,such as the four-part season opener ""The Bunkers Fight Inflation"",in which Archie is laid off from his job at the loading dock & the series 100th episode which was hosted by Henry Fonda-It was a look back at memorable ""AITF"" moments (ie:Archie meeting Mike,Edith's menopause,Gloria's miscarriage).Season 5 also saw The Jeffersons leaving the neighborhood for their ""deluxe apartment in the sky""-The pilot episode of ""The Jeffersons"" (1975-1985) also aired that season-All in all,this was a great season in more ways than one."
2,Extra Tall Gate,"Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate - White (30"") I have this gate and it functions really well. It is difficult to put together in that you think it is broken because it doesn't seem to come together at the top....BUT it does when you continue to crank it down. I have another brand of shorter gate that is the same system. I did find it in black and my only negative comment is that I would prefer the door walk through be a bit wider. It does stay put."
2,Motorolla NOAA Radio,"This weather radio performed as expected during the Tornadofest that hit the southeast the last week of April, 2011. Moved the radio to the bedroom during the night but it did miss one Tornado warning for our area. I'm thinking it was due to the location of the unit in the bedroom more than anything."
1,Used to be a big fan,"I've read all of Harlan Corben's books and thought they were witty, imaginative and a great read. My husband & I picked up the unabridged audio CD version for a long drive this week. It was so awful we stopped listing to it and tried the AM stations. Very disappointing. The plot wasn't bad but the dialog was awful and rehashed the same thing from 2 or 3 perspectives. It was like he added about 200 pages of superfilous dialog to make up the word count."
1,It's just plain bad...,"Having read a handful of reviews prior to watching this, my bar was set pretty low but this failed to elicit even a chuckle. The movie rapidly sways between American Pie caliber phallic jokes (which fall flat) and painfully dry Lifetime-level relationship drama; I have no idea what kind of viewer they had in mind when they made this thing. Save your time and money, and watch any prime-time half hour comedy at random, which is sure to provide the same level of entertainment. The scenery was the single redeeming item here. Watching this during a sub-zero Northeast winter provided a bit of vicarious warmth."
1,Doesn't work in stereo mode.,Bought this for my cell phone so I can have hands free and stereo mp3 access. The first one didn't work in stereo just mono. The company promptly sent me another one ( didn't want he broke one back). Got #2 and the same thing was wrong. I tried it in 3 different cell phones and even 2 different 2.5mm house phones with no luck. You get what you pay for but you should get what is advertised ( Stereo ). Company was top notch though.
1,"Item does not match description, poorly put together.","I know this is a cheap item so my expectations are aligned with the price. However whatever the price, the item should match the description. The description says ""59"" full size professional tripod for any camera or camcorder"" however at maximum height the tripod is only 51 inches tall. That may not seem like much but it's the difference between recording at head height or chest height.The over all build quality isn't great but it's cheap so I can live with that. But I can't get the camera level which is a deal breaker. To fix this I would have to file away part of the mount to allow it to move to the level.I'm going to return the item it isn't up to my $6 expectations."
1,"Buy ""Two Towers"" instead!","This is a very mediocre game based on the book. You will probably enjoy reading the book much more than playing this game. If you want a ""Lord of the Rings"" game, I highly recommend ""The Two Towers"" which is much better."
1,Not what's advertised,"The battery that I received it's not like the one showed in the picture, I purchased this battery because I was expecting a Samsung battery and it was not, I received a generic one with scratches on the surface."
1,ummm... maybe I am in left feild picking daisy's but.....,I just didn't vibe with this band. They sort of sound like 'The Ex' which is a GREAT BAND (check them out) but they lost me with their signing. This would be a great band if they didn't sing. Its almost like going to the dentist.
1,"7 months old, sprung a leak!!!","We bought this in February. We used it about 5 times a week to brew 4 cups of coffee. Yesterday (9/17) we set it up to brew coffee.....came back into the kitchen 5 minutes later to find that all the water was now over our counter, and in the drawers underneath the counter. Was it our human error? So we checked it over the sink. We poured some water in where the water is supposed to go.....water quickly began dripping out from underneath the water housing unit. Not from the coffee pot mind you. :-( We still haven't got hold of Black and Decker to see if they will replace it or somethingALSO, we only use filtered water in it so no, it was not hard water messing it up somehow....."
1,i hella love hyphy,"and this aint it. on a jazz rating this gets deez nuts. so cereal. its subpar wack jazz at it's crapyist. and making hip hop digestible for non hip hop audiences? don't listen to hip hop if you dont like hip hop. hip hop sampling is nothing like these garbage guitars and keyboards over a beat and hook. and if you don't have the musical intelligence to understand that... then i have a pair of kenny g tickets for you.im not intending to be defamatory according to the review guidelines.. but im calling it like i see it. from someone who has little jon next to the john coletrane and duke ellington album recorded on impulse! in his record crate. (read: records, vinyl, albums, LPs)ps, i think i got jipped out of the one star i was forced to rate this."
2,Better Than I Thought it Was Going to Be,"I purchased this e-book to learn more about the new Nikon Capture software. I am not a professional but have enjoyed photography for decades. I now shoot in RAW to obtain maximum flexibility. I own Adobe CS2 which is a very powerful program, but for most of my personal work, I just don't need that much power and the time it takes to ""process"" a photo. I decided to try Nikon Capture with the new Control Points. It is a great program. Since the new version came out, there aren't many resources for training, books, etc. This e-book by Jason Odell was one of the first, so I thought I would give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised with how good of a book this is. Jason takes a very practical approach and the book is very easy to follow and learn from. I would highly recommend the e-book for anyone that needs a little more instruction on the new Nikon Capture."
1,"First book by this author, not sure I'd read another","To sum things up, this book could have been cut in half (at least!) and gotten the same point across. I almost gave up on this book a few times, but for some reason kept reading. The ending was okay but everything leading up to it was long-winded. This was my first book by Jodi Picoult and I honestly don't think I would read another by her, sorry to say."
2,Good History,"Well written overview of the history of these battalions with very good content. My only complaint is that the men of the battalions are listed by date of death rather than alphabetically (making it hard to find a particular person). It would also have been nice if he had listed all members of the battalions, not just the dead, especially as he refers to having access to such a database in the foreword."
2,Awesome!!,Best series ever! Finished this book in three das amd immediately jumped to the next one. Fun at evry scene and thrilling adveture! I greatly advise anyone to read and enjoy R.A. Salvatore and his many works
2,Top-shelf book on teams. A foundation text.,"Larson and LaFasto put their outstanding research into easy-to-understand language. The book is foundation reading for executives and team members who want to understand the key variables that spell success for teams. And it's an easy-reading 138 pages presented so anyone (5th grade reading level!) can understand their findings. I know the authors, and have the utmost respect for their scientific methodology and experience. We use the matching team/ leadership assessment and training program to help client organizations plan, build, and fix their teams. Really an excellent reader, and a foundation of our consulting practice."
2,Most of Jason's movies are pretty bad`,I didn't like the second and I didn't really like the first. Jason X was good but did they need to make nine rough drafts first. This one was bad but I thought some of the characters were ok. The same thing happens everytime though. At the end of all the movies a girl is left running away from Jason. Is that worth seeing ten times. Jason's my least favorite slasher of the three and his movies are by far the worst. Please don't make Friday the 13th part 11.
1,Not well made,"I'm giving this 2 stars because it works great for small and quick meals. However, after my third use, the lever to the warming lid broke off. Now it is secured with duct tape. Yucky. After the sixth use, the back of the unit, the white coated metal is now a burnt brown color. Makes me nervous that it gets hot enough to color the body so quickly! As with any appliance, do not leave unattended!"
2,Good quick overview,"This is a good overview of vitamans, minerals and other supplements. A good starting place and quick vitamin reference. I read the paperback version years ago. This has some updates to that."
2,Much better than I thought it would be.,"Despite it's title (which does the book a huge diservice), this book is a great beginning point for anyone interested in wicca or wondering what the witch in their life is up to. It covers a wide variety of topics with a light touch, but underneath that it's quite serious. I know this gets a lot of flack, at least it does in my local wiccan community, because of the title. Don't let that put you off. It really is quite good and is probably one of the best 101 books I've ever read."
2,Great value for money,"I received this walkman for my twelfth birthday and since then I've been using it non-stop. The G-protection is incredible. I wear it when cycling, running and when I practise gymnastics, I've shaken it, dropped it on the floor, even out a window and it doesn't skip at all. Battery life is good and the sound quality is excellent. The player itself is lightweight, attractive and easy to use. The Remote is a great feature and means I don't have to keep getting it out of my bag when I want to change tracks or adjust the volume. There are a wide range of volume settings: I prefer my music fairly quiet and always keep the AVLS switched on. The headphones I swapped for some of my own: the originals were cheap looking, uncomfortable to wear and I prefer the small, in-ear design. However, this is a small drawback and the CD player's other features make it a product that is great value for money. I never regretted choosing this Walkman, and I would recommend it to anyone else.~Jenna~"
1,mediocre,"The transmitter works, but poorly, signal intensity/range is weak compared to other transmitters I've used. Also I didn't realise that with my model of zune (8gb), this transmitter does not fit flush with the sides, it sticks out about an inch from the left side of the player, which im guessing is because it was probly designed for older, larger zunes."
2,Nice,I bought this for my uncle for Christmas. It arrived on time and was in great shape. I'm sure its a good buy!
1,Awful mix,"This soundtrack was bad. The songs and the mix of artists was not effective. Seems like it was all thrown together at the last minute. The only good song is Kenny Lattimore's smooth Beautiful Girl. Particular disappointment goes out to Maxwell with his two tired, full of fluff songs. Pass on this CD or dub it from a friend. Spend your dollars on Amel or something else"
2,Tremendous Comic Book Movie on BLU-RAY,"I thought that Spider-man 3 was a tremendous comic book movie, Sure there are flaws; to many villians,not very plausible and maybe a bit to sentimental. Who ever stated that comic books are plausible? There is outstanding action all the actors are superb-Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) is a treasure. The special effects are outstanding and most of all the movie has HEART.The BLU-RAY is a state of the art High Defintion presentation with exquisite picture and knock-out PCM sound. This is a must buy, now is the time to enter Blu-Ray High Definition!"
1,WHAT TO DO BEFORE BUYING SOMETHING? ESPECIALLY ELECTRONICS DIVICES...,"What I do first of all, is to read about the product that I want to buy on Relatives Magazines or Internet sites. There, you can learn from the especialist, usually who speak because of the industry pay him, but not always.But, what you shouldn't never do is: Don't read about the owner's opinions, because, we don't receive paid from anybody, sometimes could be, because, everything is possible, but your instinct will show it to you, even though, not always.Por eso es que opino que el articulo anterior me ayudo. Asi aclaro mi punto de vista sobre ciertas garantias, los que trabajamos para compañias de telecomunicaciones, sabemos como funciona esto...Be careful!"
2,Loved It!,This movie is so fun. I sure hope that the two of them make more movies of the type again. Loved it!
2,Fabulous,"I read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. It soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. It took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it."
1,Loved it until it broke,This was the perfect good-looking replacement for boring Pyrex and I used it often - until one day it suddenly cracked right down the middle while I was roasting a small turkey breast in the oven. Makes me completely wary of purchasing another as they're quite expensive. I have a similiar roasting dish from Cost Plus that's made in Portugal and is still going strong. Wish I could find more of those instead. (much cheaper)
2,"Nourishing, High in Calories","MY cats really love this.Even a very fussy cat will find it irresistible. High in calories , it's great for small eaters who need to gain weight and strength.There is no wheat flour in this product, so that not need be a worry."
1,flaky products,"A retractable usb cable seemed like a great idea and for the first few weeks I loved it but very quickly items I plugged in were no longer recognized by the computer. I thought it was the computer for a while. One day while switching usb jacks in frustration I noticed that if I held the cable at a certain angle it worked. Quickly, the necessary angle got narrower and narrower until a week or so later, the cable no longer worked at all. The materials these cables are built with are not up to the stress of repetitive extend/re-track movements."
2,How to support your local sheriff,It was a gift for my brother who is a huge old movie buff - he has already watched it a few times since Christmas and calls me everytime laughing about something he has seen.
2,It's a compelling read,"This book was my introduction to Larry Block and a fine one at that. More than a mystery this book is a real novel! That said, I do think that there are moments when Block is a little bit over the top. In particular with the character of Susan. The long psudo-porn scenes with her brutal to read and add little to the plot. Maybe her sexual obsession is her way of coping in a post 9/11 world, but I didnt buy it personally. I thought everthing involving her was a tad indulgant on Blocks part.That aside though there are pleasure's aplenty here for the decerning reader and I would recomend this book."
1,$80 for $20 Worth of Product,"I have done the master cleanse diet and yes it works but its a shame how people overprice items. Do some research on your own, you can find the HOW TO's on this diet all over the Internet. The products all together will run about 20-25 dollars. You can find in any health food store or vitamin shoppe and grocery store. Just make sure you use the grade B Maple Syrup. Google lemonade diet or master cleanse to get all the free reading material you want and also visit youtube for free instructional videos about this cleanse and many more. In this economy its important to spend wisely and save where ever you can. GOOD LUCK!!!"
1,Not totally useless,"I bought this to use in my car. It was not powerful enough to do a more than a modest job. I wish that I had not bought it, and just paid for a powerful vacuum at the car wash. The Dirt Devil will do OK if you are just picking up dust bunnies, cat hair, or light objects. I gave it 2 stars instead of three because I consider it's label, ""Extreme Power"" to be false advertising."
2,Good paleographical primer,"This is truly a 'pocket-sized' book, but well-made. It's a good introduction to paleography, and I've found it very useful. I use this in conjunction with online resources, which I appreciate but just aren't the same to me as an actual book. I purchased this one to aid in genealogical research."
1,WAY FUN. WAY TOO VIOLENT,"THis game is alot of fun. I know what people have said. The graphics are terrible, the control stinks ... blah blah blah. THis game is a lot of fun. Bullet time fast gunning action can't be beat. Unless you have some assemblance of a soul. YOu can not honestly play this and feel like everything is ok. THough I had fun, I felt guilty the entire time I played it. Every single level requires you to bust down a door and begin completely obliterating about 12 people. This can't be good for the soul can it? SO, though it may be tempting. Avoid this one. I can not recommend a game that glorifies so much blood and gore.Bottom Line: Is it Fun? Yep. Will I keep it? You will finish it in about a week. Multiplayer is terrible. Is it for kids? You should be huung if you let your kids play this one. And, what's bad for kids is rarely good for parents."
2,One rare book,"I'm reading Mrs. Bridge for the 3rd time. It's unlike anything I've ever read before, except Mr. Bridge, which I've read twice. Highly recommended. An extraordinary and brilliant read. I only wish they were 1000 pages."
2,"Great product, well crafted","These were a gift to my mom for Christmas. She loved them and kept commenting on how well designed they were--weighting, coating, etc. This site was also much cheaper than some other online sources for the same product."
2,A lot of nostalgia at a great price!,"I won't review the movies, because chances are if you are looking at this, you've already seen them.The special effects have long since been the spectacle they were when the movies were released, but that doesn't stop the power of the story of a boy looking for an escape from his everyday problems. Imaginative, uplifting and fun it's quite the bargain.The second movie doesn't quite have the power of the first, but if nothing else it is enjoyable to visit new locations in Fantasia and meet new characters."
2,Great book!,"I love the valdemar series, i was estatic when i found out there was a new set of books coming out :) I am only on chapter 6 but it's rocking so far =)Anyone notice that there's a little blip where the name Elspeth is used instead of Selenay? Its when Alberich and Selenay first meet, a page or two after.Probably use to always writing about Elspeth the past few years :)"
1,Bush on cover explanation,"John, the reason bush is on the cover is because it's against NCAA regs to use a college player's likeness to make money. Therefore they have to use kids that are no longer playing college ball. That's also why there are no names for any of the players in the game.It's one of the many insanely stupid rules the NCAA has come up with, but there it is."
2,Fun,"The beginning was a little slow, but as you get to know the characters, you learn to love most of them. There is wonderful use of forshadowing, in this book especially, and I only have one criticism. This is totally a male fantasy. This theme of hormones (yes hormones, not necessarily love on the guy's part) begins to run a lot deeper in the later books, and is somewhat annoying to us female readers, but overall it is a fun read. It goes by fast, adn you really get to know all of the characters. Don't be daunted by the size of the book it is a fast and enjoyable read!"
2,This was a great deal....,strats...tele...just about any solid body..will fit in this bag....got my Wildkat in it now...til I buy a HSC later...great for the Washburn Series-X also...
1,Superficial and repetitive,"A complex topic (fatness and size acceptance) is presented with a one-sided perspective, and worse, the book is boring. While some of these ""facts"" might be new to a few readers, mostly this is a rehashing of old data combined with her qualitative research and personal experiences. Every chapter ends with tips, and they all sound very similar. The chapter on the spiral of acceptance sounds very similar to the Stages of Change presented in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, but her suggestions for how to go through the processes are, again, very simplistic.The idea that some weight loss for health can be appropriate is an anathema in this book.Maybe an o.k. introduction, but if you are the least bit familiar with size acceptance, read elsewhere. (The best part of the book is it's cover.)"
1,it kinda sucked a lot,"""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" is the song to blame for the death of punk music. Dexter Holland's voice is incredibly annoying. I kinda liked ""She's Got Issues"" and ""The Kids Aren't Alright"", but the rest of the CD is very bad. I used to like the Offspring, but now they completely sold out with ""Pretty Fly"". If you want REAL punk music, check out Bad Religion or Refused."
1,SUPER JUNK,"Gift for 10 year old daughter, wotrthless piece of junk. Will try to return it to toys r us. WE GOT IT FOR FREE & ITS WORTHLESS!"
2,Best of an Designs TEXT!,I've use a differently design for use a photoshop or other something you will need it now. I've enjoys of a differently designs on the computer. Thanks so much :)
1,Almost Garbage,"First, this is published by an extreme left-wing anti-US military company. It is forwarded by pointless political propaganda.However, this follows the theme of the entire book. While there is some useful strategic information in Giap's words, you have to wade through tons of Communist ideology to siphon out a few ounces of outdated information.At best, this is a diluted companion to other more informative texts. Or for indoctrination into any pro-Communist anti-U.S. group."
1,Did not work,"I followed all of the instructions and very carefully added the colored ink to my cartridge, but could never get it working in my printer. I'm very disappointed and had to trash this one and order a new HP cartridge."
1,Worst cookbook I've owned,"I own many cookbook and actually can cook fairly well. I've tried 10 recipes so far and each one is crap. I think something went wrong when translating the Italian on measurements, cook times, and cook heats. This may be the best Italian cook book out there, but only in Italian. Avoid the frustration and lost $s, and get something else."
1,This Movie is Terminally BAD!,"Boring, slow, Dull, one of the WORSE movies I have ever viewed. Save Yourself some precious time and watch a good movie, i wish i did. how the heck could a studio allow such rubbish to be released. it makes you wonder."
1,He sang better the first time,"His voice is strained, the music sounds like a warped record and I will never play this cd again. Better to use the sounds of 40 years ago, than to sing them 40 years later."
2,It came with child,"To my great surprise, inside my gallon of Tuscan milk was a small orphan boy. Thank you so much! WILL BUY AGAIN!"
1,Didn't do it for me,"I did finish the book, but wouldn't recommend it. I wanted to like this book, and did enjoy some of the descriptions of the authors interactions with his younger brother, but found much of the book too tedious. I like memoirs and autobiographical books where the author seems to be open and honest, but Eggers book did not ring true for me. Skip this book and read This Boy's Life by Tobias Wolff."
1,Not a good value,"This is too much like SQL Server 7. If it said SQL Server 7 on the cover or just SQL Server, I suppose that would be ok. But it says SQL Server 2000.I agree with the other reviews that say its boring. Its very, very boring - its a tough read. You can't just sit down with it - it will put you to sleep.Also there's no XML info. There should be lots of it. Its just a real disappointment."
2,Just guide bushings,Not a whole lot to say here. These are just Bosch guide bushings and they work well....not alot to them.
1,THIS ORDER COMPLETELY SUCKED!!!!!,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE AND IT TOOK ABOUT 2 WEEKS TO GET HERE, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT I CAN NOT PLAY THE DVD ON MY PLAYER BECAUSE IT IS THE WRONG REGION!!! I TRIED TO RETURN IT AND WAS ADVISED THAT i COULD NOT RETURN THE DVD!!!! NOW I HAVE A DVD THAT I CAN NOT WATCH!!!! THIS SUCKS!!!!"
2,Mom Loves this Stuff,I ordered this for my mom who swears that it is a great. she says it works quickly. It's hard to find in stores so I am grateful that Amazon makes it easy to obtain online.
2,T.M.N.T Leonardo,"This is a very durable toy. The swords are cool too. However, disappointed with the pack that is supposed to go on Leo's back. This did not attach and will not. My son has fun playing with him though and that is what really counts...I guess."
2,Unbelievable ship time!,"This part was ordered just prior to Sandy's arrival on the East coast. It was shipped from their warehouse in eastern North Carolina 10/29, arrived in my rural box in southern South Dakota on 10/31! Not only was the shipper prompt, the postal service more than timely, but the part put my house generator back in service after only three days interruption. The starter assembly fit better than Honda's OEM part that had failed."
2,Works,Used it in a Cajon Drum I built. Worked great and not much money. Just wish it was super saver shipping eligable. As for all things from Mucisian's Friend.
2,Never buy another one.,"Bought several of these light a couple years ago and they STILL WORK!!! Unlike regular tripods which break and need constant bulb replacement, these things last. The one time cost will more than pay for the 10 tripod lights you would need to replace over the length of any project. Not only the replacement cost but the cost to replace the bulbs or fix regular tripods make this light a great deal. I highly recommend trying one and am sure you will want more."
2,"John Williams is a master, but.....","The music is fabulous. I have one reason for the four star rating: it's incomplete! I have all three other SW soundtracks, and they all contain the complete score from the movies. I don't know who made the decision to do differently with TPM, but I think it was a mistake. Other than that, this CD is a must-have, unless you want to wait for the complete version."
1,DisneyMania 4 fails to deliver-- Don't waste your money,"I usually love Disney pop, no matter how enhanced the performers' voices are (which is usually the case, since Disney uses actors with lots of appeal and only marginal vocal talent), but this ranks as one of the most inane, bland compilations.The only songs worth listening to are ""A Dream Is a Wish"" (which is carried by the talented Raven and Alyson Michalka) and ""If I Never Knew You"" by the Cheetah Girls.The worst songs are ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Tisdale has a terrible voice, and this version of the song is constructed poorly), and Miley Cyrus's rendition of ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" which is too slow to be enjoyable."
2,"Solid book, but not alot of depth","I have found this book to be a good reference, especially as a quick reference. It is clear and concise. The examples and text however lack detail, as such when using something for the first time I prefer to use other texts that go into greater detail."
1,It's getting hard to take,"(1) I am not interested in Patricia Cornwell's political views, which seem to erupt from every character's mouth, esp. Scarpetta's. Is it possible she's changed editors? That would explain this phenomenon, as well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are in desperate need of editing. It's fairly typical for a bestselling author to suffer under bad editing b/c people feel they can't say anything to her.(2). Why kill Benton Wesley? He was the only thing that made Scarpetta seem even vaguely human.(3). What is the purpose of the Lucy character? She seems to be getting weirder and weirder. If the point is to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians, even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious security risk, well, I am still not convinced."
2,Works Well,"This tool works well for what it is; if you lose your disc in the middle of a stream where you can see it but don't want to actually wade through the stream to get it, then this is the perfect tool for you. However, don't expect too much of it; you're not going to toss blind into white water rapids and start pulling out free discs by the dozens. It's not actually a golden retriever, it won't get your paper in the morning, shoes in the afternoon, or a beer from the fridge in the evening. Conversely, you won't be on pooper scooper duty with this in tow, but it might still be your best friend."
1,Wrong Name,You can't relax to this cd. To much talking by Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis. And too much clapping before and after most of the songs. Was very disappointed. Sent cd back and haven't heard from any body yet. Will not order any more until I hear from them.
2,Davis & Dvorak - Not So Bad,"There are clearly better choices available when it comes to inexpensive 2CD sets of Dvorak's last three symphonies than this title by Colin Davis. In fact, there is even a better one in the very same Philips Duo series -- the one by Witold Rowicki and the London Symphony Orchestra (see my review). Other better buys are the Giulini on EMI Double Forte (not the horridly slow Sony title that was mentioned below), Von Dohnanyi on Double Decca, and Kubelik on DG (see my review of the box set of the Nine Symphonies). With that being said, this set is really not so terrible. I think we all feel a little let down by Davis because so many of his other Philips Duo offerings are among the best of any given work available -- the Complete Sibelius Symphonies, Haydn ""London"" Symphonies and Beethoven Piano Concertos to name a few. Oh well, you can't hit a home run at every at bat."
2,Best acne product ever used,"It has cleared probably 80% of my acne before I even finish the box. This is the only product that ever worked for me. It is not drying, not irritating. I especially like the retinol formula. I see improvement every morning I look at the mirro. Now I can see hope that my acne will be completely eliminated soon. I will continue to use this product as a preventative."
1,"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.",I am a HUGE SOUTH PARK FAN but this thing STUNK. They hurried up and cashed in on the popularity of the series. Even my two kids wanted to leave the theatre because they were bored with it.
1,Three days of fun and now in storage...,"I was very excited about these based on the reviews, but forget that and realize that they are simply flat pieces of wood all cut to the same dimensions. They are very thin, so even though the children had fun for a day or two stacking them, they do not resemble any actual building materials I have ever seen. This makes it difficult to do anything useful with them, and not particularly educational unless your child is going to build Dr. Seuss houses when they grow up. If shaped like bricks, they'd be far more enjoyable and practical.Our creative and smart 7-yo and 3-yo have not touched them in months after three days of stacking them and trying hard to balance them on their thin sides. So in that sense they are educational because my children learned what shapes aren't great for building with."
1,BEWARE OF THE POT HOLES OF BACKROAD,"A confusing chronological order and unrevealing flashbacks mar this Indie thriller. An overusage of pointless panoramic vistas doesn't help either. None of the characters are likeable, especially the psychotic Jasper and Joseph, the mysterious stranger. The finale is senseless and does little to bring resolution. BACKROAD is obviously intended to be a parable on good vs. evil, but ends up a disjointed example of style over substance---and the acting is pretty bad!"
1,Never again,"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality."
1,"Works, but not as well as I would have hoped","I bought this originally because I had seen it used before. It worked so well, and my dog sheds quite a bit, so I was hoping to have the same success. However, it doesn't remove as much hair as I saw when originally used, and you have to press pretty hard to remove excess. Also, unless my dog is wet, it removes barely any hair. Quite disappointing."
2,Tired of doing your school work?,"If you're tired of doing your school work or having define this or who said what, than here you goFor 6$ you can save a few hours and get a better grade!"
2,Only The Beginning!,"This miniseries directed and partly produced by Charles Dutton is set in Baltimore. It's almost the people behind The Wire are using an ensemble cast. I just watched the miniseries again after going through withdrawal from Treme. Great acting by everyone. Only this time I'm paying attention to all the actors who moved into The Wire, in other roles. Gritty street scenes. An up close and personal look athe world of drugs in one little 'corner' of the world. If you missed or if you've forgotten it, I urge you to take another look. If you are a fan of The Wire and/or Treme I urge you to take another look. This was the beginning."
1,Huh? What? What time is it?,"Oh, sorry... fell asleep again. That seems to happen every time I put this on. You know how everyone describes a CD by saying ""this sounds like X crossed with Y?"" Well, watch the 11:10PM weather forecast on a really small market local newscast (preferably where it snows a lot), then filter in a really boring AA meeting, and you'll have ""A Ghost Is Born.""In many Wilco reviews, there are phrases like ""takes a while to sink in"" or ""takes repeated listenings."" That is what people say when they really mean ""this sucks, but I'm going to force myself to like it, since everyone else does."""
1,32 flavors...,"Alana definitely has some talent, but the fact that she goes and covers an Ani DiFranco song fundamentally without RBR's permission, and then turns it into a teeny bopper hit is a bit argh, shall we say angering. She totally missed the point of the song. save your money and buy Ani's Not a Pretty Girl instead."
1,STunk,"This movie stunk. Don't see it. It's the gayest movie ever made. I would give it 0 stars, but it's not allowed."
2,A trust in the goodness of creation,"This work I found extremely interesting. In particular I enjoyed chapter two - Jesus and the Ecology of Galilee: Ecological Factors and Human Culture.I found the use made of Halovr Monxes' discussion of place as a contested space very insightful.The work reveals Dr. Freyne's great understanding of Jesus in the context of Galilee. It opened up for me such questions as why Jesus was attracted to the villages of Caesarea Philippi and to Mt Hermon: to the wellspring of the Great River.The following line from page 149 touched me in a special way:""His (Jesus) was a faith that was grounded in a trust in the goodness of creation as he had experienced it and reflected on its mysterious but hidden processes.""May the ebbs and flows of the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus be empowered by this fine work."
2,The Greatest Movie That Will Ever Be Made...Until Episode 1,"I know it may have some flaws (like Mark Hamill's wooden acting in the first few scenes) but Star Wars: A New Hope isn't just a movie, it's an event. Seeing it makes you feel good about your fellow man. It makes you believe in the good guys again. And in a world full of negative imagery, I like the escape that Star Wars has to offer. I'd rather tolerate a few minutes of mediocre acting than a whole movie of despair."
1,Kindle Joy,I love everything about my Kindle 2. I read a lot and I'm only concerned about storage and the fact that I can't erase what I've read. It's the perfect size to take anywhere...and I do!!!
1,WARNING - doesn't run on laptops,it would have been nice if lucas arts had bothered to tell us that this will not run on laptops. you can't upgrade the graphics card on a laptop to enable you to run it either. I have a 2GB PC but this still won't run! REgardless of your views on the game - don't buy it if you have a laptop
1,"Absolutely atrocious, avoid this game like the plague","This game was so bad, and left so much to be desired, that I, someone who never writes reviews, was compelled to write one, just to keep other people from buying it, and ultimately further rewarding an extremely subpar release. The game play is horrible. The graphics are sloppy. The animation is unfathomably choppy (the frames per second are very very low, maybe they could've gotten away with this 10 years ago on Nintendo version 1 or something). If you're expecting anything like arcade gameplay, look elsewhere. This was something that was dished out to the public to make a few bucks, and not much more. Quality and effort just weren't put into this game.Blah, wasted money."
1,Heart Cutters,"Ridiculous set of heart cutters. Two of them areexactly the same size and shape, plus there's onein the set that doesn't even resemble a heart....Not sure what it is. Only one small one in the setas well. Disappointed."
1,complete waste of money,i bought this for my son who loves spiderman.. he slept on it one night and never wanted to sleep on it again. it is so rough that it can almost be used as a pot scrub. it was a complete waste of money.
1,TRASH!!!!,"You get what you pay for, thought I was saving money but still getting a compatible phone for my Vonage system.. it was compatible it just didn't work..Phones would not charge and base would not boot up. several calls later with Vonage I found out these are discontinued old models.. don't waste you money or time. I did it for you."
1,I'm an old 3EB fan,"I bought this cd simply because I love Third Eye Blind, and I still do love the band despite this new effort. Listen to it before you buy it, don't buy it on spec like I did. The problem is not that their talent has disappeared, but that it's a flat recording. I don't feel the umph that I require from a song. It sounds like they beat it to death in the recording studio, and lost the emotion of the words somewhere along the way.I was so surprised that I switched players to make sure my speakers weren't screwed up. It wasn't the speakers. In well thought out lyrics and sounds, somewhere it died for me. It seems from the other reviews that many people disagree with me, but my recommendation is to listen to this cd somehow before you purchase it. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should see them live to find their spirit, because I don't think it made it to cd."
2,best i have used,I have had all the various juicers and this one is a work horse performed so well I have given away all the other juicers I usedIt is the only single gear juicer that the auger is offset to accomodate carrots and other vegetables the other single gears cannot accomodate because the auger is directly under the feed tubeA+++++++++++++++
2,"Works Good, Easy To Clean","This hand blender is not only stylish, but does a great job of blending smoothies and whipping potatoes. It is also good for whipping home made butters and lotions. The bottom part comes off and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleanup."
1,BEWARE; author is a scam artist...,"I could not even get through the first chapter despite repeated effort and vigilant prayer.... I have since had the misfortune of a lengthy relationship with the man that claims to be this author (he is pictured in the books) and know him to be predator, a liar, a thief and a disgrace to the Christian faith. His ""ministry"" has damaged the walk of many Christians and brought shame upon the Christian community. Please pray for him but DO NOT support his works."
2,9th Da IIIest!!!,"True School HipHop From Start To Finish!!!! Illmatic Beats, Dope Rhymes, Straight Classic Hiphop Sound all the way Through, 9TH wONDER IS A BEAST! COP IT!"
2,An exceptionally readable book on Kung Fu,"The Spirit of Shaolin is an exceptionally readable book for those interested in discovering Kung Fu. It takes you on one man's journey to finding himself through this practice. That the man happens to be David Carradine, TV's Caine, is an interesting parallel. For those more versed in Kung Fu this book may contain too little, for those who adhere to Bruce Lee and his methods this book may anger, for those of us who are curious and who are an unwritten page ourselves this book is just what the doctor ordered."
1,Was sent the wrong clip,"The company sent me the right case but the wrong clip. I contacted the company and went back and forth with them for a while and I haven't heard from them since. Mistakes happen, but fix them."
1,Bad reception and no security,I purchased this monitor as a replacement for a more expensive monitor after the handset broke. This baby monitor lacks any security so you are broadcasting out to the whole world your baby's room. There is significant audio and picture static and other interference. Our screen would sometimes pick up security cameras from a car dealership down the street. The handheld unit is very bulky and the camera mount makes it difficult to mount on the wall and angle. Considering this unit is $140 its a rip off. I would look elsewhere.
2,Review of Mr. Rush's AP Environmental Science Class,"This dramatic account of this toxic dinoflaggellate is factual and descriptive. The beginning is well-paced and keeps the reader's attention. However, toward the middle of the book the plot becomes repetitive and more politically based. It was frustrating for the reader to read all the processes of funding and the failures. The book informs the public of a topic that is kept secret by the government. The author researched the data well and presented the information in an interesting way including a cliff-hanger to end each chapter. Overall, this book is recommended for an interesting read into the danger that lurks the coastal waters of North Carolina."
1,Writing for the audience of oneself,"Mr Zinik's work is not destined for ""the masses"" and I don't think he really wants it to be enjoyed by too many. The use of the languare is so sofisticated that sometimes one wanders how the author with all those complicated words manages not to get wherever he wanted to get initially. Couple of stories are amusing but too long (for the content) and most of them are promising at start and dissapointing at the end. I would not recommend buying this book unless you are particularly interested in the mindset of intellectualised Russian intelligencia that is trying to meet ends in England and is unhappy about everything."
2,Great Value,My son loves Thomnas Trains and these DVDs are priced well. Received on time and continue to order many others. Great product and he enjoys them over and over.
2,Surprisingly funny!,Very funny movie - mish mash of multiple genres into one fun ride! Janet McTeer's performance is unforgettable. Tony Curran plays a great villain; Paz Vega... well... she's a killer. Scott & Alphonso make a very funny duo.
2,Want More Storage for all those Digital Photos? This is IT!,Compact and easy to use with just a USB cable and no complicated new sorftware to master. And with more storage space than the hard drives on both my 3 year old desktop and 2 year old laptop combined. It has proven to be the perfect solution for my storage needs. I couldn't be happier.
1,Useless,"You are better off buying your kid a pair of scissors. This toy requires the user to move the cutter VERY, VERY slowly to get it to cut through the paper or foam. It's not very accurate, doesn't do a great job cutting, and requires D batteries. Waste of money."
1,"Dont buy this book to learn ""groundfighting""","I must admit that this book is well produced. Great pictures and a nice hardcover and illustrations BUT the content is terrible.First of all this guy is a ""hapkido"" expert. He has no business writing a book on ground fighting and the techniques in the book show this. The locks he shows will get you killed against anyone with experience in grappling. If you want to learn real groundfighting buy a book written by someone who is a true expert like Royler Gracie or Rigan Machado. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the most effective and efficient art of groundfighting and is what people really want.Why do I know that this is what people really want? Because if it wasn't for the recent popularity in ""groundfighting"" started by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu experts such as the Gracies and the Machados this ""Art of Groundfighting"" book would never have been produced. Don't waste your time."
2,Helpful workbook,"Wipe Clean Activity Work Book (Wipe Clean Activity Books)A wide range of activities including dot to dot, letter, number and shape tracing, counting trucks, animals or bugs, Mazes, writing words, word search, upper and lower case letters. Use over and over. What could be better?"
2,Wonderful part of the Borrower's series,My family loved the Borrower's Series--even into adulthood! Each story is well written and filled with images. One feels as if one is a borrower themselves and can see the world through their eyes and miniature height. Great fun!
2,A great book but you need two more aids,"This book is great! The exam is real tricky - its the only one I have ever failed on first try - miserably! No book can prepare you for the Architectures exam fully but this book gets very close. I guess if you have a few years experience in data modelling you can pass with just this book. but if like me you have very little experience in data base design and data modelling, you definitely need something else. I bought and read the Data Modelling book by Lawrence Sanders after I failed this exam. That is a little book that fills in all the gaps! After reading these two book, anyone can pass this exam. Oh, one other thing you most likely will need is the Transcender sample tests. This exam is unlike the othe Microsoft exams and without the Transcenders it will be a shock the first time you do it and that may cause you to fail. So invest in the Transcender sample tests for this exam and you will be glad you did. Good luck!"
1,Bad Gloves for Cold Weather,These gloves are not good for cold weather. I have run with these gloves when the temp is between 25-35 degrees and I could do better with a pair of $2 cotton work gloves. The gloves look nice and fit well but the main purpose is to keep your hands warm and these gloves fall well short of keeping your hands warm.
1,inferior design-sporadic effectiveness,"After researching many smokeless ashtrays, I chose this more expensive one based on technology and the makers name. Should have just bought one of the lesser priced ones. Talon states it needs cleaned occasionally-twice a week is more like it. The nicotine builds up all over the outside dome quite rapidly. It is difficult and awkward to clean. The two small plastic hinges which regulate the angle and height broke off within the first month.-Thus it keeps falling down on itself. Do yourself a favor and buy a smokeless ashtray that is half the price. This one falls apart more quickly than an AMC Gremlin. In addition, no matter how carefully you clean it[I treated it as if it were a piece of china], it works only off and on once it has been cleaned."
2,The best chimes I've owned,"I bought a set of these Wind Dancer chimes for my new home, and I can't believe how beautiful the sound is. Apparently there is a difference between ""tuned"" and ""not tuned"" chimes, because these chimes make subtle, clear sounds that are perfect for weekend naps. I've had other chimes that are too clanggy-sounding for that all-important task!"
2,It actually works.,"I'm 15 this year, and I actually enjoy this book. Believe me, I've tried for a while to find a good vocab book. ""1100 words you need to know"" seriously sux, and the rest of them are pretty bad too. The only other good one is a very small section in ""Up your score"". But anyway, this book is a page per word with a huge picture in the middle and a few sentences with the word in it at the bottom. Then once in a while there's a review. THis is the first book I have used where I have actually remembered the word after say about a week. And if you don't want to fall asleep memorizing the word in the first place, this is the book for you. Buy it. It works."
2,Jerry loves em!,Our vet recommended a supplement for Jerry. This appears to be helping certain conditions. We will reorder when we run out of this purchase.
1,"Unreadable, Obtuse","I bought this book to learn about World History, in order to comprehend todays world a bit better. Last night I gave up. I made it to page 429. I scanned ahead to WWII to see if it would improve. It did not. I am 62, and have an advanced degree. The reading is just incomprehensible. As others have stated you have to read some paragraphs several times to understand what the author is trying to say. It is obtuse to the nth degree. An example: he uses the words ""Anatolia"" and ""Levant"" without defining them anywhere in the entire book. I learned more from looking up these words online and reading about them in a miniscule fraction of the time I've spent reading the book. The maps are atrocious. All in grayscale and extremely difficult to tell one gray shade from another. The text on most of the maps is unreadable. I do not recommend this book."
1,NO CLIP,"The case I received has no clip. Must be ""new and improved"" version.... Too bad because the case itself is nice, there's just no way to clip it to anything."
1,Generic Junk,"The Cutter Wore A Hole In The Screen After About 3 Shaves. So Stick With TheGenuine Remington Parts. They Cost A Little Bit More, But They Last A WholeLot Longer, And They Work Much Better Too ! Check Overstock Or Drugstore.ComFor Genuine Remington Parts. Their Prices Are Good."
1,This book is [not good],"My review title says it all. If Reilly set out to write a really bad book, which would eventually be made into a really bad movie, he succeeded admirably with ""Area 7"". I recently read the book at an island holiday resort, and the only reason I didn't throw it in the rubbish (as I eventually did when I returned to the mainland) was that I had nothing else to read on the beach. Reilly develops his characters such that you frankly don't care who lives or dies. His plots are inane, and considering the research he claims to have done, they contain numerous technical impossibilities. Frankly, the book reads like it was written by a 12 year old. Someone should also disable the italics function on Reilly's word processor. Not only are italics grossly overused, they often just don't make sense. Save your time, don't buy this book, and certainly don't read it."
1,not what i expected.,"it did not provide me with clear information.i did not show me how to make the windows i was hoping to build and i feel it was written for an actual tradesman or someone with a lot more window building experience.if i had that knowledge and skills, i would not have been looking for such a book in the first place.not happy with the purchase."
2,Great Book,I am just lost of word to describe this book. It is one of the best book I read in my life. Even with the known ending the character building the dialemma and the story development is just extra ordinary
1,Amazingly Bad,"This volume contains but three short speeches by Malcolm X, all of which are available elsewhere. These essays were then dubiously re-edited and reorganized by Archie Epps in some sort of misguided attempt to refine them.The first 60% of the book, moreover, is taken up by Epps' own scattered, incoherent essays, which are astonishingly bad. Epps had the idea of comparing Malcolm X (a person) to ""Shakespeare's plays"" (not a person), which is an incoherent idea in itself. His method of scattering random Shakespeare quotes throughout a thin account of Malcolm X's life makes this bad idea, weak in conception, even worse in execution.If you're interested in reading Malcolm X's speeches, which you should be, get ANY other anthology or collection in print. Anything would be better than this."
1,"""Cardinal Proof"" but not ""Squirrel Proof""","The perches are much smaller than I thought they would be and the cardinals cannot perch and feed on this feeder. Smaller birds - finches, nuthatches, chickadees and sparrows - have no problem.It's not squirrel proof as they figured out on the second day how to hang from the bottom, avoiding the perch, and eat seed out of the trough. It's not easy for them though and has slowed down the amount of seed I was going through. Also, the top of the feeder slides up easily and they can get inside it by just pushing the top up. My husband put a clamp on one side to fix that problem.I'm disappointed that the cardinals can't get into this feeder and will keep my platform feeder up for them. So in the end, I guess I'm not really using less of the expensive birdseed after all!"
1,"Very, very disappointing","I have read every book Stephen King has written and this has got to be the worst ever. It took me weeks to agonize through it and I only finished it because I started it and hoped it would get better. Now I am reading ""Wizards and Glass"" and can't believe the difference in writing, like 2 different people wrote these books. I hope Stephen King will go back to his old style of writing and leave the love stories to the romance novels. He is still the best horror fiction writer ever."
2,Just right for carrying necessities,"This is the nicest waist pack I have ever owned. It's got room for the necessities without feeling like you should be carrying a backpack instead. I like to wear cargo pants, carrying a book, two wallets, a cell phone, a pen or two, a knife, and so on. For those occasions when I want to wear shorts, this pack can take care of everything I normally carry.That doesn't mean it couldn't be improved. The cell phone pocket is too small for an Android phone, and the other front pocket is too small for a largish wallet. But the cell phone pocket is perfect for a large Leatherman or other knife, and the middle pocket is just right for a paperback book. The front pocket holds change, lib balm, thumbdrives, or other small items, and the large rear pocket, while oddly shaped, could contain a swimsuit, small towel or something similar. The waist strap is adjustable to about 48 inches, and if you need more than that, I suggest you wear it across one shoulder like a bandolier."
1,Don't buy,I purchased on Amazon and it was used buy my 3 kids over the age of 10 for about 30 minutes before the chain became separated from the claw. Impossible to fix with out unscrewing many screws and taking it completely apart. So it was packed back up and sent back to Amazon. NOT WELL MADE at all. Don't waste your time like we did. Just a junk toy.
2,UnTouched,"Nas, what can you say about him? He can't be touched. Great album, and yes, you can call this that. There is not a single track on this lp that will let you down. Nas' rhymes are deep, take the messages he gives you and let them help you through life. Nas never slipped off, just wasn't given due respect. And it's about time he did."
2,Absolutely excellent,"The WRT54GL is a fantastic product. I have bought two so far, one for me, and one for my parents. Both have been solid and stable performers since the day they were installed. This router is also incredibly priced. For most people, this would be quite enough, but this model offers many advanced features far beyond what is typical for its price-point. In addition, DDWRT runs excellently on this router. In total, this is a great buy, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,"A honest, good and important book","Contrary to what one might think, this book does NOT make the argument for ""leaving it up to the experts"". Quite the contrary, it ecourages science educators to stop teaching science ""because"" people ""need"" to know basic scientific principles (it may be difficult to accept this, but Shamos gives loads of evidence of why it is an empty goal). The book does by no means discourage the teaching of science. It argues for a CHANGE in the way science is thaught, and in the reasons behind the way science is thaught. Its main argument is that science must be taught because of its aesthetic value, because that's the most realistic way to get good, effective and, above all, honest, science teaching."
2,Excellent Background and Setting,"It's interesting to have a campaign set in the Asian lands of any world. Honor is key above the traditional good and evil. This Rokugan sourcebook excells at giving you a great setting for the adventures. Filled with politics and intrigue, as well as the traditional kill the monsters stuff. It really has something for everyone. Maybe it has too much detail, because it causes me to worry if I will remember everything on the fly. Take notes!"
1,Excluded Tracks - AudioSlave - Revelations,"Movie was nothing special.But!! There were 2 killer tracks in the movie that are not on the soundtrack. Apparently they are from AudioSlave's upcoming release ""Revelations"".The track titles are:""Shape of Things to Come""""Wide Awake"""
2,An inspiring contribution to metaphysical studies,"In The Vast Enquiring Soul: Explorations Into The Further Reaches Of Consciousness, Ronald Russell argues compellingly for the including of the human soul into everyday thought and conversation, that any scientific concept of the world will remain incomplete unless taking the soul into consideration. Russell evaluated current consciousness research by scientists, philosophers, paranormalists, theologians, poets and historians, and found that consciousness doesn't reside only in the brain, but within the whole body, the earth, and the universe. The Vast Enquiring Soul is an informative, articulate, fascinating, and at times inspiring, contribution to metaphysical studies and the nature of human consciousness."
1,"wrong cover, wrong album, wrong number of discs","This isn't the 2-disc ""The Complete Helen Ward on Columbia"". Corrections need to be made. I can't differentiate between the sellers' products. Your description says 1 Disc, but there are too many songs showing for one disc. Also, it appears Helen Ward sang many of these songs, but it's not the complete edition."
2,It has a tone of seriousness in its subject.,"I liked the book for being different from the normal Saint stories. The plot is wide and it makes you think. The Saint plays a more thoughtful role in this story as he can't make a false move. He knows that he is the only one who knows anything about a coming war and he is the only one who can stop it. Actually, that's what I liked about this book. The Saint didn't do anything remotely rash in this book."
2,It's become a favorite.,"Both of our children love to be read this book, and it's a great bedtime book. Beautifully illustrated."
2,Great for Training Treats,"I have used these as training treats for better than a year. My maltese loves them. I don't find them to have a bad odor in the least. They are soft, so easily cut into tiny pieces for training. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.I feel they are safe and healthy for the little furbabies!"
2,Proof you don't need a fancy gym to work out,"This book should be taught in schools. I have learned things from it I never thought possible, and really enjoyed it.This is a true ""low cost"" type workout book, it really focuses on solid workouts to build strength and burn fat, but doesn't rely on expensive machines or equipment to do so. Most of these things can be done easily in your own home!It really focuses on ""adult"" schedules and I like that. When you're juggling a job, family and who knows what else you dont have a lot of time and that is the focus of the book.The author knows the subject well, and it shows. It also focuses on hard work, not fluff or BS. This is not a ""get skinny quick"" scam book by any means. The author is very honest about what you need to do.I'll definitely be coming back to this book and getting even more serious about it. It's worth the price for sure!"
1,Not as versatile as you think,"I had cubing vegetables. It is a chore during cooking that I have never fancied. I thought with this I could save a lot of time. Unfortunately, that just wasn't the case. The product couldn't go through a 3/4"" slice of sweet potato and the outer layer of a peeled onion (i.e. not the husky layer) gets stuck in the grate. It was not a simple matter to get all of the vegetables fully through the grate is what I am driving at. There was always a litle work afterward."
2,trusted friend,I used the vhs Shape your body when it first came out for years and it did shape my body in all the right places. I love it!
1,Very disapointing,"I bought this dictionary for my 3rd grade daughter to help her on spelling. The excitement was gone in 30 minutes after not being able to find more than 3 words in 10 searches. Many easy words can't be found, and most of word descriptions are so simple that she still can't really understand the full meaning of the words.The calculator feature in the dictionary is pretty much useless.She likes to play Hangman with me, but we always have to add the word to the word list, and ask Hangman to get the word from the list.There is also a game called fun with Spanish and French..it was interesting to look the sentences in Spanish & French once, and that is about it.The screen resolutoin is very low, so the letters are quite jaggy.I am very disappointed with this particular dictionary. Maybe I should try the other more expensive models."
2,Survival Strategies for Parenting a Bipolar Child,This book is a must for any parent who has a child with Bipolar Disorder. After my son was diagnosed I have read wverything I can find on Early Onset Bipolar Disorder. There is not much out there but this is one of the best. Mr Lynn covers each topic in a straight forward manner and in an easy to read and apply manner. If any one you know has Early Onset Bipolar Disorder or Bipolar in general this book is a must!!
2,The Best Show on the Air!!!,"I am so excited about this DVD set! The mother-daughter relationship is heartwarming and sweet, and Stars Hollow and the people who live there are quaint and hillarious. I would reccomend this to anyone but especially a mother and her daughter(s). It is an amazing show for the whole family. It's so rare to find such a good quality show that everyone can watch."
1,Basketballs,"$5 balls foir $20 each - cheap, rubbery, and too big for the hoop they claim to be designed for."
1,Pink Floyd is terrible !!,"Damn, I wasted my money on this stupid album! I can't understand why Floyd has so many fans! It is usually safe to buy the debut album of a ""supergroup"", but either this assumption doesn't hold good for this band or they're just another mediocre, overrated band."
2,bring the forest alive,"I loved this book not only for the excellent directions and nice pictures but it gave me an instant craving to start working on a quilt with the simple ""puzzle method"" patterns. My quilt is finished and looks great."
1,So boring I skipped almost 3/4 of it,"In a weird coincidence, both this book (on CD) and The Nanny Diaries (in print) arrived for me on hold at our local library the same day. It was like having two copies of the same book, both of which were boring and annoying. After reading (or listening to) about the first quarter of each book, I skipped to the last chapter or two, just to make sure that I wouldn't miss any strange and sudden surprises. I didn't. While listening to this book, I was put off by several elements: the reference to ""Jappy"" college colleagues, the narrator's inability to tell her two Indian roommates apart after living with them for a year, her repeated use of the ear-grating phrase ""as best as."" What is supposed to be so compelling about characters who have the boss from hell and are too stupid to quit? I'm glad that I didn't waste time reading both of these books in full, and that writing this review constitutes the last chunk of my time they will take up."
2,This book is to long for college classes,"This book provides a great deal of indepth information. It was required reading in Chinese History Studies At Oklahoma State University Under Dr. Park, who completely tried to destroy every reasonable rational the book provided and used certian passages to distort history to fit his idea of it. So buy the book, stay out of Any classes taught by Dr. Park and learn on your own."
1,Horrible waste of time,This book by far was very disappointing. Three quarters the way through it gave u a dictionary.....What the heck.......then that was it...it ended like that!!! By far very disappointing read.
2,Mr. Reese tries to give the Biblical view.,"I was privileged to have Mr. Reese as a professor at Central Christian College where I received my degree. I sat in several of his classes, especially the class on Acts. He was always sincere in his teachings and wanted to give the correct understanding of the Scriptures. Even though you might not agree with what Mr. Reese has concluded, you will always be given as much information as he could find and share with you. I would recommend this book for anyone who is desiring a better understanding of the Bible."
1,Note my name,"Did not finish as was bowled over by the unbelievable amounts of rubbish his book contained, i have to admire both sean and ann, despite being unable to tell the truth they continue to spurt out books like this. no wonder people in america are supposed to be idiots, this kind of thing is probably the only media these people, (and i stress i am not among them) got hold of.oh and sean, when someone is presenting facts to you, it is not 'fair and balanced' to shout 'SHUT UP' at them. but neither is Fox so you are in good company."
2,Oleeee Sevillanaaaa!!,"If you like Flamenco music then you will love Siempre Asi, it is actually a branch of Flamenco called ""Sevillanas"" for the noobies out there it is more orchestrated, with more rythm and with a rich full happy sound. The music is wonderful, beautiful classical guitar arrangements with percussion, drums and brass tones coloring the palette! + the voices of the eleven members of siempre asi you really need to listen to this album.If you like to get deeper also get more albums from siempre asi like ""Mahareta"", ""Cantando que es Gerundio"" , ""Todo Vale"" etc."
2,Taproot is so original and great.. this cd just rocks!,I first heard Taproot at Ozzfest and fell in love. When I came home I had to buy the cd and it was not a mistake. Taproot has their own original sound that separates them from other bands in their genre. I love them... buy this cd.. it's worth every penny.
1,Studio Greed Strikes Again,Just adding my two cents worth of this Bluray release. While I dearly love the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy I refuse to buy this release. It is shameful the way the studios try to bleed customers dry with multiple releases of the same movie. Everyone knows about the extended versions and that is what most people want. Why not release a complete set that has both versions? I would be willing to pay slightly more for that than be screwed into buying two different sets. Then the studios whine and complain about rampant piracy. Is it any wonder? Piracy is a two way street you hypocrites.
2,A Fine Collection,"I have recently received this gem from my girlfriend, and I must say that being the song writer I am that it is magnificent. To be able to write all of my ideas throughout the day and the fact that it is small enough to fit in a pocket with relative ease is great. Add to that the pocket in the back that can hold notes, loose pages, what have you, the book mark so you can keep your place and the strap to help keep your book closed when not in use and the sheer beauty and quality of this book you have quite a potent combination for such a low price. I worked at FedEx and this book got banged around dropped, smashed but you couldn't tell, it stood up through the worst of it, definitely a great buy!"
2,A short but terrific 3rd season,"Cut short by the writers strike, still season 3 rumbles along on all cylinders like it's trade mark '67 Chev Impala. New characters -- Ruby, Bela and Lilith -- are introduced to good affect. There are some nice touches : ""A Very Supernatural Christmas"", a sense of urgency as Dean's year is racing toward a rendevouz with Hell and an episode that has the charm of ""Groundhog Day"". The wit is still there. A town is inflected by demons and the boys have been locked in jail by their FBI nemesis. Under the possession of a demon he shoots the town sheriff dead. After being released he gasped, ""I shot the sheriff!"" To which Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackless) replies, ""But you didn't shoot the deputy."""
1,"Amateurish effort: Boring, repetitive, uninspired","It is incredible that a major press would waste wood pulp on this pathetic book. Given the state of the American reading public, I suppose one may anticipate more ""books"" of this kind. If you wish to know about the historical debates that attach to Winston Churchill's public career and private life, consult Robert Blake and William Louis, eds., CHURCHILL (W.W. Norton, 1993). The book contains more than two dozen essays that assess Churchill as politician, statesman, journalist, and historian. If you want an eminently readable, sympathetic, and wise introduction to his life, read Geoffrey Best, CHURCHILL: A STUDY IN GREATNESS (Hambledon, 2001; Oxford has just published a paperback edition)."
2,Great source of information.,"Excellent source of information. I would have liked a little more detail on some items such as floorpan replacement, but as a whole this is a must have book for the Beetle/Transporter owner."
2,Pan & Scan has got to go,"Why anyone would release a film in ""Full Screen"" escapes me. It cheats the viewer by showing only part of the actual image, and call me crazy, but I would think the public would want to see a motion picture the way it was filmed. If the filmmakers wanted Pan & Scan, they would have filmed it that way! Leave Full Screen to the realm of TV shows -- it has no place in the world of theatrical motion pictures!"
1,Hypocritical,How can they show that much skin and still promote Christianity when the Bible says that women are to dress modestly?
2,Good Revenge Film,"I haven't read the book, but always surprised that the film is not well known. Great movie. Worth watching, yes"
2,Unsung Missionary Heroes,"We hear lots of things about the ""famous"" missionaries, but there are loads of missionaries out there doing the same pioneering work to spread the gospel. This book is a collection of stories about a missionary doctor and his work in the late 1800s, shortly after the civil war in the US, in India, in an area that is now Hyderabad and the regions around Andhra Pradesh. Having visited there in Sept 2008, much has not changed, and a good portion of this area is still third world. The people are still warm and kind, with the same thirst for knowledge that this missionary found. It was a fascinating exploration into the early work as the gospel of Christianity was brand new to them. I wondered as I read it if any of the places I visted were churches that may have been established by his work. It was quite inspiring."
1,A waste of good paper,"This is a terrible book. I hated it so much that I couldn't stand to have it on my bookshelf and prompty took it out and left it on the street. There is no way that this book should have been published. The photographs are terrible in every way: no style, no technique - nothing. It's a shame to see paper and ink wasted on such worthless content."
1,Ok but nothing exceptional,"Although this is rather a 'fun' read it does not provide a compelling reason to follow a macrobiotic diet, after you have finished the book. The author appears to be committed to the macrobiotic diet to a lesser extent than I expected, given that she was writing a book on the topic. Her admissions to still indulging in french fries and other junk food, while at the same time extolling the virtues of giving macrobiotics your all seems contradictory to say the least. Sure, we all fall of the wagon (whatever that means for each of us) at times but Ms. Porter's descriptions of forbidden cravings and lapses seemed a lot more than that.I was also dismayed to read that all the nightshade plants are forbidden on this diet, including tomatoes and potatoes. No way could I commit to that.Not the worst dietary book I've read but certainly not the best. Try it from the library first, before investing in a copy for yourself, if you are seriously looking for answers re: macrobiotics."
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,"I'm sorry to see that most of Debbie Macomber's newest releases are following the same pattern--everybody is sickeningly sweet and there is absolutely no sexual tension, and ""Promise Texas"" is no different. The ""Heart of Texas"" series, (""Promise"" entertains most of the same characters) which started out hot totally fizzled towards the end (I've never read a more disappointing book than ""Lone Star Baby"")and I think Macomber should let this group of characters rest in peace already. Enough is enough!"
1,CHEAP WOOD,"Support frame is split in half, not together how it looks in the pics, weak support. NOT a good product if you want it to last for long times BUY ANOTHER bed with BETTER WOOD TRUST ME TRUST MEEEEE."
2,Marketing Superstar,"This book is a great book, however it is not his best. I would advise getting How to Become a Rainmaker or How to Become CEO. They are better books. This one was good though. A lot of really good tips."
2,Great inspiration,"On this dvd, Joe McNally shows you how he applies the Nikon advanced wireless system to different scenarios. He starts out shooting three artists in the desert of Nevada, and continues to shoot some students at a nearby high school. He does not go into great technical detail of how to set up the speedlights, but he will tell you why he puts speedlights where. In my opinion this dvd is best suited for photographers who have at least some knowledge of their flash system, and are looking for inspiration of how to use this.Even though I like this dvd, if you're just buying one, go for ""A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting""."
1,Keep your eye on the clock!,"While some of the tricks are useful, others just make things more confusing. The game setups took a long time and although they sometimes worked OK, more often than not they really slowed me down. Even worse: I only finished half the logic games section before I ran out of time. I do NOT want this to happen when I take the LSAT.I've found some of the other books take simpler approaches which are far easier to learn. That's where I would spend my money."
1,"lining tore complete after only two washings, no lining inside the sleeves of jacket.","the lining tore completely after only two washings. it also has no lining in the sleeves and is very light, definitely not for winter. now i have to sew the lining back myself."
1,Not so much,"really the game just isn't all that great to begin with. So when thy come out with the remake of the it and then add somemore levels and better graphics, you might think it is good? Wrong."
1,"Don't Buy This Phone, Static, Bad Reception","I buy 3 all they have very bad recepcion even being near the Handsets,, a lot of static, the functions are a messdon't throw your money buy another phone !!!!"
2,clock,"i really like this clock,i just look at the ceiling and i know the temperature outside and than know how warmly to dress before leaving for work."
1,Not like the old stuff!!,The cleaner is too loose and doesnt remove even the lightest grease. I used the old stuff even stains on clothing and it worked great. The only reason it only comes in two huge containers is that you will never buy it again.
1,Wayyyy too much musk,"This perfume has beautiful mid and top-notes, but is extremely musky in the low-notes. I walked into a room where someone was wearing it and was nearly knocked over. I couldn't smell my own perfume on myself anymore, as the fragrance was burned into my nostrils for a couple of hours. I am a perfume connoisseur, and I don't recommend this one because it's too ""loud."""
1,Did not fit,Even though I used the tool on amazon these did not fit on my a4. This was a fail on amazons part. I am not sure how good the product is as it does not fit my car
1,Not that great,"This toy bought for my 17 month old ""chew through everything"" English Springer Spaniel. She liked chewing on the rope until I had strings all over my carpet - which by the way are hard to see and get wound around the vacuum wheels. Within about 2 days one rope was chewed through and then she lost interest. I eventually cut away both ropes but she still had no interest in the rubber KONG section - totally wasted money on my dog. Maybe other dogs will like these but they smell like rubber and that could be the ""put-off"" for my dog. I do not recommend."
1,Cornwell's abusing her readers,"Isle of Dogs is yet another Hammer-Andy Brazil episode valued only as proof that Cornwell is a bored author writing for her own amusement instead of her readers'. This alternate series of books is as bad as the Scarpetta series is good -- and Isle of Dogs is the mutt of this litter. The plot is asinine, the writing infantile and the intended satire woefully un-Swiftian. I suspect this manuscript would have netted quite a collection of publishing house rejection slips had it not been from a prize-winning author with a ready-made readership to fleece. Frankly, I feel abused -- if Cornwell no longer finds Scarpetta entertaining, she should just be honest and quit writing instead of resting on past laurels. As for me, I won't be paying hardcover full prices again for another of Cornwell's non-Scarpetta efforts. I'll either await the paperback, or skip it entirely."
2,What a GREAT Book!,"My children are 5 and 2 and we all loved the book. It is simple and easy to follow. My son (who is 5) can even recognize most of the words. We had the pleasure of meeting Linda last fall, and her love of education and children is evident in her book. We can't wait to read more."
1,Defective mold prevented attachment of pistol stock,"This toy has two components. The front detaches and can be used a compact launcher.The pistol stock has to be attached to the front component. On the toy we received the stock could not be properly inserted. It was clocked by a protruding mold. In a partly inserted state it could not engage the firing mechanism.I had to cut away parts of the rear protruding ""wings"" with a sharp knife and a dremel. After removing parts of the plastic pieces I was able, with some force, to snap the pistol grip firmly in place. It is now locked in place and works as designed.This looks like a error in the mold or design, not a change manufacturing slip-up.Once fully assembled it's a fun toy, but I do not recommend purchasing this until you know Hasbro has eliminated this problem."
1,WORSE THAN AVERAGE,"The plot, assuming some connection between electronic computer communications with the human body was wound up with a ""living"" program with a backdoor. What a convoluted, overly-complicated plot. The characters were pretty much run of the mill cardboard stereotypes the way the author wanted them and this added to the general poorness in the book."
1,It's a hard DVD to review,"Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted. So what did he do? He went autobiographical. A fine cast of four, headlined by Marcello Mastroianni, drive from France to Portugal in search of one man's past. Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film. But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice. Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about? Beginnings and endings. What we remember, what we forget. Family relationships gone bad. Atonement. Unflinching realism. In that, it is brilliant. But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know. So I respect it but I don't recommend it. Does that make any sense?"
1,Maybe worth $50,"I got the unit to use on my Canon T2i DSLR, it fit nicely and the construction is fine as was the range but the sound is vary poor. The noise floor is high (it has a noticeable hiss) and the sound transmitted is two quiet as well as seeming muffled. I tried some high end headset and lapel mics with the transmitter and the sound was still bad. Now I just need to save $600 for a sennheiser."
1,Disappointing chess product,"I was extremely disappointed with this chess software. With my newest PC I bought this year, the program is buggy when it comes to sound and music, which they do acknowledge in their manual.The product also lacks knowledge of what keeps a child's interest. For an adult or child, the dialog and some exercises were lengthy, and uninteresting.There were a couple of fun exercises, but really not worth the price as a whole.If your a chess player, I suggest you teach your kid yourself, orfind another chess program.There's got to be something better than this."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased 2 sets of these glasses, all the same strength. They are exactly what was advertised. No Frills - Durable all the same style. They look like they are a unisex style with the frames being neither male or female in style. I use them as extras around the house. Both my husband and I can use them. Cheap and Easy!"
1,It goes without saying!,"Prior to reading the ""about the authors"" at the end of the book it was apparent the writers had disdain for all things conservative and or republican. Shots were taken at ""talk radio"", Ollie North, the 2nd amendment, etc. It should have been no surprise to learn that Neil Abercrombie was an elected democratic Congressman and Senator, obviously embittered at losing the House and Senate to the Republicans.Don't waste your time reading this farce of a book! It's partisan politics at its worst!"
2,Super Mario Bros. 3,Great game. One of my favorite Nintendo games. My kids even enjoy playing it as much as I did when I was a kid. Love it.
1,It is frustrating. Too stressful. Can't be solved.,I bought the cube for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and unscrambled for her to do on her own. It is now 1/6/04 and we haven't been able to put it back. I have passed it around the office and everyone gets frustrated. I wish I could get my money back. It isn't rewarding at all.
1,mill is a problem,"The mill over grinds beans. For a ""flat"" filter versus a ""cone"" filter the grind should be on the large side. If you set the mill to the lowest setting the beans are hardly ground at all, on the next setting the beans are ground into dust, i.e. espresso grind.The latch over the mill broke on mine.When this machine finally dies I'll go back to one without the integrated mill."
1,Not worth your time,"This book is not nearly as interesting, enriching, or well written as the other books in this series. (I highly recommend the Voyage of the Beagle by Darwin, for example.) Publishing a whole volume of Ledyard is really overkill, and misstates his importance as a writer and historian. While the 20-page account of Cook's murder and the, er, unpalatable aftermath of his death is riveting, the rest of Ledyard's journal is dull. The private letters that make up the latter half of the book have little of interest to the general reader. For much better travel adventure about the same regions that Ledyard covers here, read Darwin (see above), or the Mutiny on the Bounty trilogy by Nordhoff and Hall, or Farley Mowat (especially The Siberians)."
2,......* insert something clever here*,"Great cd. It's punk jazz. I personally never thought that was possible. I guess it is, and this band pulls it off spectacularly! If you want more by them here's a hint: they used to go by the name Kara's Flowers. This is a band proclaimed talented by the likes of John Mayer and Jason Mraz. It doesn't have that characteristic richness of regular punk, the guitar is very...well, it's... it's great yes.. what's the word I'm looking for... It's specific, they're songs have some very specific guitarwork. I suppose. Don't listen to me I play piano not guitar. Anyway, great cd, although the guy's voice gets on my nerves after a while. That's just me though, I still like the cd a lot."
1,"Common Title, Poor Editing","The author has chosen to use his story in book form as a means to provide an outlet for his own therapy (not to mention while getting paid at the same time). I think the book could have been better written -- dialogues and all. A soror sister in the ATL sent me this book and I cannot endorse it to my soro sisters in San Diego. I understand the author wanting to climb the band wagon along with E. Lynn, Marcus Major, Carl Webber, R.M. Johnson, Michael Baisden and such likes, but he has a long way to go. This is one of those stories that nearly every ex-married person can relate. Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about his. My advice to the author and those who suffer heartache and pain: Turn all your cares over to God because he cares for you. You may or may not find temporary relief in white pages and black ink---but you will definitely find permanent relief in Christ Jesus."
2,Works on little rodents,I used a B&D EX900-A-TP1 till it died and I know that worked as it was once turned off in the garage and I had the spring loaded traps still set along the walls...sure enough caught one. I then ended up buying this new EP1100-A as a replacement and haven't had a problem either. Keeps the rodents out of the garage and prevents them from creating havoc on the cars.
2,Love the English versions of the classics,"I am such a fan of Pride and Prejudice! I adore the A&E version, which cannot be topped in my opinion, as well as the old black and white and the ""Bollywood"" version, Bride and Prejudice. I purchased this DVD and enjoyed it very much. I have several of the old classics done in the 80's by the British, and have yet to be dissappointed."
1,"I kinnot hold'er cap'n, she's breakin' up...","This wasn't even a LKH novel, at least that is what I'm telling myself in order to be up for future books. It had little story line, what it did have was incoherent and very un-LKH like. One sexual travesty to the next and then in the last few pages the quick ""Last five minutes of Star Trek"" wrap up. This book contains brief mentions of the furry... the upcoming new ""big-bad"" and then it ends with a bit of an ""eh"". This book could have been so much more, should have been so much more. This would have been the ultimate Edward book, but he was emasculated in Obsidian Butterfly.I hate to say it, but I'm losing my faith. I miss the old Anita.Guess I'll have to go back and read the earlier books in the series for my ""fix"".Bitterly Disappointed"
1,"55mm, not 54mm","The wrench described here as a model 7612 is actually a 55mm wrench, not a 54mm wrench as advertised. The package matches the ""7612"" model number, but is clearly labeled as ""55mm."" The item that came out of the sealed package measured between 55.6mm and 56.0mm (using precision calipers) across the flats."
2,Great Product,My husband has been using this product for as long as it has been sold. Women come up to him all the time to ask him what cologne he is wearing and comment how great he smells. He also uses the related products of this scent.
1,Avoid,"_Mirdad_ is an attempt by Mikhael Naimy to imitate the kind of writing the Sufis did best: a little odd, but meaningful and rewarding on multiple levels. He fails. The best that can be said about this book is that it is a good insight into Naimy's mind, with half-baked anticapitalism, stupid comments on science, and smug self-satisfaction included. (Not that I'm against self-satisfied nonscientific anticapitalists, you understand, but I prefer it when they have a cogent position and can write well enough to express it).If you think you can read passages like 'Verily, Man is the darling of the Universe. All things are glad to pamper him' or 'All orders of being below Man are enclosed in group ova . . . always the more evolved enclosing all the orders of Life below it down to the central nucleus' and still think that the author is wiser than you, then go right ahead and get this book. Otherwise, steer clear, and try Idries Shah for a wiser, infinitely more satisfying dose of spirituality."
1,Not up to Pilcher's standards.,"I have read a few other books by this author and and found them to be engrossing reads. I want to say to anyone who is thinking of reading Winter Solstice to instead read her outstanding Coming Home instead. That is one of my aboslute favorites and is vastly superior!I was eager to read this newer novel , but saved it to enjoy around the holidays. I just could not be absorbed by this and found my self not really caring about the outcome. The characters lacked any depth, growth, and development. The story line was terribly slow and meandering. You realize how lacking a novel is when the most intersting character is Horace the Dog! A great disapointment.Pilcher is capable of so much more."
1,Ambiguous and Lacks Organization,"To learn the details of GSM, this is not the book to choose. The text contains a vast amount of information but not in a manner which is readily understandable. There seem to be holes in the explanations and, in some instances, contradictory statements. After two days (well, one was a Friday so maybe that doesn't count as a whole day) of trying to make sense of the chapter on logical channels and frame structure, I am at Amazon looking for an alternative.This book makes me want to learn enough (from some other source, of course) to write my own book."
1,Yawn!,"This CD does not deliver! It's bland beyond words. It has not one song that really spin my wheels. How dare the makers even refer to this as house music. You could have this playing in the background at a social mixer. But if you are true househead, if you like some bumpin' base and some mega-soulful singing, then you will be disappointed there. There's hardly any disco to it either. Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm a Chicagoan and Chicago is house's birthplace. Still, this shoddy imitation does not do justice to this amazing dance genre."
1,'Gator Bait,"Awfull acting, trashy script and lowly directing. Claudia Jennings was beutiful and just only reason why to watch this movie!"
2,"A tad repetitive, but overall pretty good","Overall I really liked the CD, I just found some parts of the songs repetitive. You can repeat a lyric to make a point, and then you can really just beat it into the ground. Aside from the two or three songs where I skip the last minute, this was a really great album. Emilie is very talented both in singing and in the instruments that she plays. I am particularly fond of the voice layering effect that is prevalent in her work."
2,Good calculator,Its a good calculator. Really easy to use and no flaws. I suggest everyone should get one and use it in class.
2,trish boots review,I find great comfort in wearing my Trish boots. It has been over a month since I purchased them and I am commpletely satisfied. I am planning on buying another pair in a different color.
2,Great Book !!,"This is a great read. I've read enough of these grizzly books to know that I will NEVER camp in grizzly country. Another really good read is ""Night of the Grizzly"" about the two college coeds at Glacier Ridge Park in Montana who were dragged out of their sleeping bags and killed. They did not die right away and it is a very chilling true story. I first read it in the 1970's and never forgot it."
2,Powerful,"My boyfriend has this playing at his place one Sunday after we got out of church and I throughly enjoyed it. I asked him where he'd bought it and he said that he rented it from blockbuster. I went home and ordered me one, him one and by best friend one from Amazon. He was pleasantly surprised when he received his copy and I can't stop watching mine. Mt best friend said that she let her friend hold it because she's going through something right now that this DVD may help her get through. Tye is energetic, passionate and annointed. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who loves to worship Jesus. *Singing* I had no other choice but to trust yooooou, that's all I could do. I had no other choice but to belieeeeeeve. This is ""feel good"" music, yall!"
2,All she ever wanted,Most exciting very good will read more of this author enjoyed the book very much will be on the lookout for more of this author
1,"Needs a seventh season, possibly an eighth.","Unless ABC gives us two additional seasons to finish the series as it should be finished, don't bother. Just watch the first season (the strongest, anyway) and the finale. The rest is just tons and tons of questions of things that Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof thought would be cool and then never bothered to answer. The list of open questions and plotholes after watching the finale is mind-numbing. So, avoid watching hundreds of hours of TV for nothing. First season + Finale will tell you all you need to know, and all they managed to tell us.What a disappointment this was, after all these years."
2,Just what I need!!!,"After researching for months I found this great machine. It is easy to use and a awesome price. Why bother with features you will never use, I already own a great digital camera (Canon Powershot S100)and basically wanted a camcorder for video. If your looking for a great looking cam at a good price search no more Samsung is the way to go. Great job Samsung!!!!!"
1,Fooled Again,"This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch! I just bought this last one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience."
2,Fun,This car is very fast and durable. It goes 20 mph. I crashed it at top speed and it still runs perfect. It runs 30 minutes on acharged battery pack but it takes 4 hours to charge. But this is a great car
2,Carol Burnett at her best!,"Carol Burnett was clearly in her element during the Q&A part of her series, and this DVD shows many of the funniest highlights the show has to offer. It's also great to see that Carol, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway, and Harvey Korman still have it now, even 30 years later. Their quick wit, comic timing, and gift for ad-libbing shine through! Highly recommended!"
1,difficult to use and extremely poorly organized,"I've found the O'Reilly C# Language Pocket Reference extremely useful and sensibly organized. Unfortunately, this pocket reference for the other main .NET language is just the opposite. To my mind, a poorly organized pocket reference is a fatal flaw. For example, the table of contents is 2 and 3/4 pages long. Almost two of those pages describes pages 1-17 in the book (covering constants and enumerations in detail), while the other 3/4 of a contents page describes, with no detail, the remaining 125 pages. With no index as well, it is almost impossible to find what you are looking for except by looking page-by-page. Want to find, say, the syntax of a select statement? Then you have to wade through a hundred-odd pages of non-alphabetically listed function descriptions."
2,Exactly as Pictured,"This product arrived in a beautiful cardboard box (instead of the traditional shelf packaging that is difficult to open) that had the product pictured on the exterior. All pieces that are pictured were included, including the wisemen. Each Little People figurine was packaged separately in plastic bags, and there was a cardboard partition between them and the stable.I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a cute Christmas present for a child from a Christian household. It is appropriate for children 9 months and up (In my opinion), but that all depends on their developmental level. Our 10 month old will love it, but mostly because they are just the right size for her hand and will fit nicely in he mouth.I look forward to getting more sets from the Little People line."
1,no show,They sent an email saying it was sent and then two days after the sceduled deivery date they send me an e-mail saying they didn't haveit in stock. never deal with this stupid operation again
2,Great set.,"We have used this several times since we recieved it a couple weeks ago. The one piece I have been a little disappointed with is the lid magnet. It did not pick up the lids very well, (it is a little dangerous to fingers to have lids drop and splash boiling water) I finally just gave up and used the tongs to get the lids out. That being said the other products have worked well."
2,Overall Armageddon is a wonderful movie.,"Armageddon is a great combination of romance, action, human drama, comedy, and a bit of science fiction. It combines an amazing cast with loveable characters, a realistic storyline, and exceptional special effects."
1,Preaching to the choirgirls,"I'm an enormous Tori Amos fan. She is one of the greatest artists of our time. But this CD is horribly flawed. Tori's strengths lie in her musicianship and her lyrics. Though she is adapting the songs they are still someone else's songs and someone else's lyrics. So what is left is a great artist's take on songs that weren't very good in the first place (Enjoy the Silence) or songs that should never be touched (Happiness is a Warm Gun). Ultimately all it is worth hearing the disc for is the concept. But you can't really listen to a concept. You listen to songs and these are average at best. The concept of a woman's take on male skewed music is intriguing, but who does she think buys her records? She's preaching to the choir. She'd be far better off producing more wonderful original music and perhaps making some converts."
1,I'd give it 1/2 a star..,"I'd give it 1/2 a star if I could. Actually purchased this at wallyworld because my 10yo one crapped out. The intermittent ""lock-up"" problem is still in existence. It's not really a lockup more like pauses but still a royal pain if you're gaming and get kicked. NOT recommended."
2,beats the sh*t outta ANTS,"great dvd... animation is all too realistic, extremely funny and entertaining... definitely worth it"
1,A nice album from four nice guys.,"This record is quite [bad]. 'Side' and 'Afterglow' are standout tracks, but most of the record shows little evidence of growth from ""The Man Who"". I've given it 2 stars because I am a Travis fan, but this isn't a record that you'll keep in your CD player unless your collection is already pretty weak."
1,"Great subject, unreadable book","I was so excited about this book, being a fan of the Zwicks' newspaper and the authentic philosophy of the Catholic Worker movement. I'm sad to say it read like an undergraduate thesis - an undigested compilation of quotations and bland abstractions. There is great material here and the Zwicks deeply understand and live out the Catholic Worker movement. The book just needs a lot of editing and rewriting to be palatable to this lay reader."
1,This sucks!,IS this what next generation gaming is??? Pathetic. Microsoft is just trying to take everybodys money again.
2,Sailing Back,"This was worth reading for me because Allen Farrell is a legend amonst boatbuilders. Building with hand tools, pieces of driftwood, boats without engines... He was kind enough to include the lines of China Cloud for others to use. Quite a kind gesture for the admirers of such an unusual and beautiful boat. The book is not about China Cloud but about the Farrells. This book tracks their history in BC and what the people and country used to be like. There are a number of replicas of China Cloud being built.G. Bowen"
2,Great silver chain,"Works well and looks really good when my wife is wearing it around her neck. She has nickle dermatitis so it's kind of difficult to buy her any jewelry at times, even silver jewelry depending on the silver is made. This chain has not caused her to break out at all. Wish that I could say the same about the pendant that I had bought to go with the chain.Since she has begun wearing it for the last couple of weeks it is proving to be very durable. It also doesn't seem to be tarnishing, it continues look good over time."
1,Awful quality.,"The quality of this camera is abysmal at best. Seriously, it may be some of the worst quality I have EVER seen out of a webcam. And if you are planning on low light situations, just throw in the towel. Returned this the very next day after purchase."
1,Just Terrible,"The artwork was so bad that it was almost impossible to tell what was going on in half the panels. The story was just pure trash. There is not one redeeming feature in Dark Knight Strikes Again. I have no clue why Frank Miller decided to follow up DKR with this garbage. I expected much more when I read this, and was sorely disappointed."
1,Not a very interesting book,"Hillman once again underachieves with this one. He wrote some brilliant stuff in the 1970s -- but I guess that was when he was 30 years younger. His writing has deteriorated over the years, and his creativity seems to have gone limp. You have to wonder why the man -- who is, or was, brilliant -- continues to embarrass himself with the string of bland books he has turned out in recent years. An appearance on Oprah Winfrey helped put his previous book on the bestseller list, although the returns of his book to his publisher were allegedly very high and the ""bestseller"" status was a fluke created by orders from bookstores (like the one I manage). One of the other reviewers said ""ho-hum"" or something like that, and once again it is true. Maybe his next book should be channelled messages from Carl Jung or seomthing -- at least that would be more fun to read than this book. And maybe more inspiration, too, for members of my advanced age group."
2,"""Make Em A Hand, Son"" (Tommy's Father on Entering Army)","I read this book when it first came out, and out of the thousands of books I have read over some 60 years, it is one of the most unforgettable. This man came out of the dust and dirt of Oklahoma and Midland, Texas to enter the Army as a grunt boot, and when he was getting on the bus to report to the Army, his Dad simply said ""Make em a hand, son"" which in West Texanese means, ""Whatever they teach you to do, Son, do a good job for them!"" And did he ever----Commander of the greatest Military Force in the History of this planet! An unforgettable true story that should make all Americans proud."
1,The dumbest Offspring product in the world!,"I hate this!There is no music at all.Its just a boring interview cd.Its just an interview you listein to!I bought it because it was a bargain,I thought it would be worth it...But no!It ...Do not buy it."
1,Commercial,"The commercial mixes of Deep Dish.If you are just getting into electronic music, this would be an option. Obviously not a cd for the advanced..."
1,2 for ease of use,"I bought this stroller for our three year old daughter yesterday and will be taking it back tomorrow morning. It took my husband and I to snap the pieces together and a lot or re-snapping to get them to stay in place. Once we got it together, our daughter could not switch it to any other position...nor could I. The pieces kept snapping out and the plastic pieces that hold the frame together are already showing signs of stress. While pushing the stroller through the house, the front tray simply fell off. We were quite upset with the wheels also. The wheels are simply hard plastic and do not turn well. I was disappointed that I had to take this toy away from our daughter, she was so excited to get it. Spend a bit more and buy the graco car seat stroller combo, much higher quality."
2,GREAT PRODUCT AT GREAT PRICE,THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. IT PROTECTS MY PHONE FROM SCRATCHES.
1,Better than no paprika at all!,"The product is ok, but the packaging is not. The plastic lids had come off of two of the packages and spilled the product inside the box. There was rust inside of the tins. I believe that another reviewer had the same problem. I found a much better supplier on the Internet--in Vermont, of all places!"
1,2 childish 4 me,this movie was 2 childish 4 me. you can predict basically wat is going to happen because it is obvious that bolt will save....i am 12 years old and i reccomend this to 5-10 year olds
2,Hatchet Review,"The book hatchet is a great book that recommend to kids. This book is a book about a boy name Brian who is visiting his father.On the way to his father the airplane crashed. The only thing he has with him was a hatchet that his mother gave him.The things I like about this book is that if you don't know any survival techniques,you can read about this book and find out about what your suppose to do.This book is one book that I really enjoy reading.This book has its own challenges or obstacles as you read.But at the end its surprising the way he acted towards all that happened to him.I recommend this book to kids who are into books that like about survival."
2,Solid Tool for Chopping,"Easy Grip for stability, allowed cutting harder vegetables more easily and alsokept up the speed of chopping, I recommend this item for your everyday chopping."
1,Review,I was very disappointed that this was not Mark Lindsay singing on this CD. Nothing was aid that it was not the original songs.
2,Excellent plot/acting,I have seen this movie a few times and every time I see it I learn to appreciate something new each time. Selena as a child and adult are very convincing. Kathy Bates does an great job in this movie. The suspense and irony is great.
2,Pam can sing anything,I've always thought that Pam Tillis was one of the most versatile singers out there and this album again proves me right. She puts her own stamp on her fathers songs and yet lets the lyrics and melody shine through. This album is a great tribute to her father and I'm sure he couldn't be more proud.
2,Great reading!,On the Run is SUCH a good book! Who would think a little old lady and a young sidekick would find such an adventure on an emu farm! Lorena McCourtney is an excellent writer. Not only is this book a good mystery--it's funny too!
2,Gorgeous book--a must have!,"As gifted as she is controversial, Leni Riefenstahl's ""five"" lives are imminently fascinating as this impressive book will prove! Even to the uninformed or casual observer, this edition will entrance. A great addition to your library, especially if you are impressed by the 102 year old dynamo who continues to prove filmmaking and photography as an art form. A living testament to the fact that ""bodies in motion, stay in motion!"""
2,Very imaginative... fast-paced... interesting... I liked it.,"I loved the entire Harry Potter series (or at least the three that are out). The Prisoner was the best, by far. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and, unlike many books, the character you suspect most is usually not the one that's to blame. I won't give away too much of the story, but I will say this to those who haven't read this book yet... Hermione is the key!"
2,Music of Mali,I am not as impressed by this singer's voice as some reviewers. He is no N'dour who has a similar style. He is less classical and more pop in my opinion. He cannot compare to Toumani Diabate.
1,Wait for Collection 5,The original advertisment listed the last episodes of season 3. Instead Volume 5 contains 2 episodes included with Volume 3.3.
2,"One artifact per campaign, please","I liked this book. You can use one artifact and structure a whole campaign around finding and/or destroying the thing. The rest of the book you can use as generic Bard's tales, provided your party's not so jaded that they interrupt your story to say, ""Oh, he's talking about the Eye of Vecna (or is it Venca?)! Let's go find it.""I'm not quite sure why they kept the random powers for most of these artifacts. Is there some rule that says that if you're not rolling dice, you're not playing D&D? Most of these artifacts are centuries old. I would think that they would have powers that were more constant, not different every time someone new found them.Fun book. Good items. Lots of room for abuse, but I don't feel the need to proselytize game balance right now. That could be because I'm being slowly dominated by the Dice of Mort the Mad PowerGamer."
2,Something to think about.,"The world-building in this book was superb. Set on the home planet of the only other sentient species ever found, the characters in this book are anthropologists who are trying to understand this new kind of intelligent life. In the process, they discover more about themselves than the objects of their studies. Listed as a Utopian novel in many reviews, it is not. However, it does include a distinct future Earth (in the human anthropologist's memories, actions, and attitudes) that could be described as a Utopia of sorts. This is a book for those of us who like to think, and it's one of the best books of this kind I have ever read. Do try it."
2,Good,"I must admit, I haven't been disappointed by a Virtue album yet.This album was no exception. However, I did find myself fast-forwarding through a few of the songs. Most notably, the ones toward the end-""I Am God"". ""Can't Believe"" and ""Down on My Knees""have to grow on me, so the jury is still out on these two songs. The rest of the album is bangin'. Virtue shows that the name of Jesus and tight beats do go together. ""Till You Believe"" is an excellent tune and inspires you to believe in the power of Jesus. ""He's Been Good"" and ""Gotta Worship"" are sizzling hot. I love these two cuts. Virtue did a wonderful job, the harmony is not as tight as it usually is, but they lost two members and picked up one. It will take a while for them to form the same chemistry they had on the former albums. Their harmonic blend is still something to smile about though. If you were contemplating buying this album, go ahead it's worth it."
2,many uses,"great product, used it to repair a hole in my jeans caused by having a super magnet in there all the time. reinforced it and now my sevens can take the stress that a powerful neodymium magnet brings upon them since theyre reinforced with a patch made by levis! also i used the glue to repair my headphones where the cord rubber actually split and the audio wires were showing, it worked great to put a layer of clear/resilient snot around it. A+ will buy more when it runs out"
2,Ten Stars - This will knock your socks off,"I kept hearing bits of this recording on a French jazz station but could never quite catch who the artist was. Thank God for Amazon, because here it is. If you love this type of Django-Jazz, you will be blown away. Musician friends of ours have sat in our living room listening to this CD in complete awe; the energy, musicianship, and sheer joy of playing comes through on this CD in a way that I've yet to experience. I can't say enough about it. These are superb musicians - it just doesn't get any better than this."
2,Great for beginners.,Very good video. Explains movements so you can understand. Good for beginers and more advanced.
1,It's not even OK...........,"I own 32 volumes of the 33 1/3 series and have read 27 of them so far. 26 of them are tremendous; this one, not so much. If you want to learn a basic history of recording medium, then this is your book. If you want insight on OK Computer, you're honestly better off reading the nutritional facts on the side of a cereal box. This book only serves the purpose of looking consistent on a shelf with the rest of the series."
1,Did not fit on my battery post otherwise well constructed,"This switch is very heavy duty, well constructed. I had to return it, however, because the hole in the cast part did not fit on my standard size 24 battery post (marine battery). Not sure if I got a defective one or they expected me to hammer the thing on."
2,Viva La Difference!,"If you want some good, unique ideas for your wedding consider this book. It is fun to read and filled with many ideas I didn't find anywhere else, such as the elegant vine and light covered gazebo that graced our ceremony. I especially liked that it got me thinking creatively for myself. While a couple of ideas seemed silly to me, who knows?--they might be perfect for you. This books shouts ""Viva la difference"" and isn't shy about it. I liked it so much that I'm giving one to my friend for her upcoming wedding."
1,Worst Software Package that I've ever bought.,"I upgraded my office 2003 with the new Office 2007 just a couple of months ago. I've been a Microsoft fan for a long time but needless to say, I've never been as disappointed with any software upgrade as I was with this one. Everything takes at least 3 times as long, it takes forever to get used to, and simple commands such as ""word count"" take forever to find. I've been happy with Microsoft software updates up to this date, but I'm amazed that a company such as this would alienate its customer base this way!!..If you're thinking about buying this package...I strongly recommend you to find something else!!!"
2,better than I thought,I got it because of the price and I would have paid twice this much If I knew it was so good. I am leaving a review because I almost didn't buy it because it had no reviews. Very good DVD.
1,What happened to character development and believable plots?,"I must say, when I first saw that my church library had picked up a new Janette Oke book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, by the end of the book, I was just glad that I had gotten it from the library and hadn't laid down good money for this dreadful piece of under developed, boring waste of paper!! Not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Janette Oke. All I can ask is...how can writers who ""scribble off"" (to use another reviewer's well put description) fluff like this actually sell books? I'd like to warn you against buying this book, and if you still want to read it, get it from the library!"
2,Best of the Series!,"This book was EXCELLENT! While I enjoyed The Star King and The Star Prince, with each book getting better and better, this one was the best by far. The chemistry between Ché and Illana was hot right from the start, you knew they would get together, and the fun was in watching how hard they both struggled against fate and the Vash Nadah. The outcome with Klark, Ché's brother, was a surprise, but very fitting. I know this is probably the last book in the series, but I hate to see it end. I will definitely be searching out more titles by this author."
1,Elitist Bunk,A book that only an conservative elitist like Coulter could write. And a book that only those who think that Fox News tells the truth could buy.
2,Great Investment,"After wanting a serger for a few years, but not wanting to make the investment, I took a serging class at a high end store. The serger we learned on was $1700 w/o any additional feet. The lower end serger for this brand was $500. I saw a review for the Brother Serger and researched it on-line. I made the purchase and have been very happy with this serger. It came with two DVD's which I found easy to understand. I've made a tent cover, a market bag and sergered seams! I am very happy with the Brother Serger!"
1,Find something better,"Thing is like 20 feet long, and the clip is retarded. The pictures make it look sick, but it's not. It's hard to clip on, it's not even a clip. It's just a gap of plastic where you have to jam your headphone cord or whatever in between it. If your cord isn't thick enough, fold it and try again. It's a piece of s***t really is what it is."
2,works very well,I got this quickly and it worked very well i used it to fix my xbox 360 and this worked like a charm
1,KITCH!,"This is a spectacular recording, with an excellent choir and players.Well, this is the good side of this CD.The weak side is all the rest.First, Sosa is very far away from her zenith - though she still have some moments. In the original recording, made in the 60's, there were 3 soloists, each of them sang more beautifully than Sosa, and as a group of 3 it was much more interesting and exciting.Second, these 2 most beutifull pieces turn here to be on the verge of kitch - worser, on the verge of ""world music""!The tempo that ricardo hagman choose is slow, so slow, but without any intrinsic reason, unless - and i suspect that this the truth - he wanted to sound very ""spiritual""...I suggest to any one who wants to listen to the real thing to buy the original recording. For an exciting interpretation, search also the version by Enzo Gieco."
2,I love his whacky humor,I read Lamb. Very funny. This one too. I'm on to the next book. Lighten up and enjoy fun reading. His books are my guilty pleasure.
1,A lot of money for a few pictures.,"Don't bother with this one, it's a thin, overpriced volume with only moderately interesting photographs and uninformative captions. Apparently, the publisher intends this as volume one of several, which, given the qualities of this text, sounds like shameless profiteering. The entire catalog of photos, including those yet to be published should have been offered together in a single volume for this price."
2,"The Birth Partner, Second Ed.",Wonderful read for anyone involved in the birthing process. Would definitely recommend this book!
2,Brother,I watched this movie with my husband and mother. I'm interested in Russian movies because we adopted two children from Russia. The movie was very realistic in portraying the hardships of ordinary Russian citizens. The main character is likable because of his own sense of justice and fairness. The movie kept our interest throughout. I highly recommend this movie.
1,earl grey more like,"I must be missing something , but you yankee chappys dont seem to understand the basics of rock music. I mean i have harder rocks in my toothpaste than this , its dreary and dull and not worthy as they say. Earl grey anyone ??"
2,This Author Knows Her Stuff!,"Though I have not yet completed this book, I am always impressed by Morgan's grasp of her subject matter and her wry delivery. This is not your average dry text. If you've got a hankering for excellent commentary on Eastern Religions, buy it. Morgan doesn't disappoint!"
2,Eloquent,"A very creative, but not over bounding. This book and thee. Trilogy are very good. They kept me reading for hours and hours. Thank you, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman."
1,Keeping Our Fingers Crossed,"Great picture and definition. The 32"" screen image is somewhat smaller than that on our ancient 26"" set which we hauled back into use when....Less than six weeks after we bought this set, it died. Just plain died. When Sony finally sent a tech out (almost two weeks after we reported the problem), he called in a report saying it was dead. We'd already told them that. He ordered a new ""A Board"" and said it would take about two weeks for it to arrive. Two weeks came and went. When I called to inquire, I was informed that the part was in and the tech had been supposed to call us. The new board was installed on December 26 and we're keeping our fingers crossed. We like the set and are hoping it will last."
2,Having visited this DVD gave me a new angle to view the many sights,It has been more than 25 years since I visited Israel. This DVD provides a look at not only the past but the present and future of this fascinating country. Truely an exhilarating DVD in the Visions series.
2,a very comprehensive overview,"I read this book to get an understanding of the history of korea in the greater sense, and also as one of a group of books on Korean history. It is very comprehensive, coverinig gthe range of Korean history from a brief synopsis of the prehistory of Korea, through the major part of ancient Korean history to the bulk of more modern history. I enjoyed this book finding it to be an interesting read, with a lot of details, would make a good history text for a class on korean history, which is exactly what I wanted from this book."
1,Lexmark INFO IS MISLEADING!,"This printer is only good for xp/vista. It is on the box as it works for older printes but when you open box, only cd for xp/vista. They advertise a website, but it no longer exist. When contacting Lexmark, It's tough luck, get over it. Advised that Windows won't allow them to support the older version. This is wrong of Lexmark and Windows if this is correct. They should stand up and make things right.. They are the ones who are advertising this incorrectly...... support should be there, as long as, item in still being sold....SHAME SHAME LEXMARK!! I do not support the purchase of Lexmark products.. Lexmark is not doing what's right. Bad customer experience... after hours of searching was able to find on website, but not because of Lexmark.. Thanks to other customers for information.. I appreciate YOU!"
2,Wonderfull story,Judie really brings her characters to life. The love Ryan and Wolf share really does transend time It bought tears to my eyes when Ryan realised she had lost Wolf for ever as she had then thouht. My one disapointment was that Dillon and Ryan didn't have a lot of time together. Please write another book with these characters in it again. I want to carry on reading about them forever. Keep writing books like A LOVE BEYOND TIME. I will keep looking our for more of your books. Yours Jackie Coffman.
1,Rather confusing,"This book didn't work for me, though I like Nutshell books. I think that alphabetical approach didn't work this time. It might be good for utilities and commands, but for Tasks and Concepts? It's much easier to find what you want on topic basis. And why on earth to use alphabetical approach if most books have good index? I have discovered another book, ""Mastering W2K Server"" by Mark Minasi. That book is great. I have found there everything I needed. It has a lot of cross-references to NT and even 95/98 without boasting much about it. Nutshell book arrogantly states that you have to be very good at NT to read it. I think that might be just to cover up the confusion created. True, Minasi's book is 50% more expensive, but it's twice bigger also, and much more useful."
1,Nothing New,"This movie was nothing that we haven't already seen with Hide and Seek or Secret Window. This was an unoriginal, predictable, below average film."
1,Not What You Think,"After careful consideration I purchased the Wind Tunnel...At first it worked like a dream, although it was very heavy and quite loud but I decided that must be necessary. The fact that it has so many rollers is both good and bad in that the vacuum is unable to pick up larger items such as pennies. Because of this fact, I believed it would be impossible for me to ""brake"" the vaccum. You see you must first gather by hand all items that won't be picked up. After 3 months of bragging what a great vacuum it was one of the rollers quit turning. My husband took it apart and discovered the ends were attached with plastic which literally melted apart. ?????? What a stupid design flaw. I promptly took it back to COSTCO and bought a cheaper, quietier and better vacuum for...less."
1,"Overpriced, not very useful","I'll be taking the USMLE in a few months, and i got this book to try to improve my study habits in anticipation of things to come, since it claims to have ""powerful strategies to help increase your score"".I have to say that for $30, this book is way overpriced and as a study aid it is completely useless. Buy this only for questions, because there are no ""strategies"" presented here. That section of this book is mostly just vague repition about studying a lot and testing yourself, and there is no clear study method presented.One of my friends recommended a smaller and cheaper, yet BETTER book called ""How to study for the USMLE"". I found it much more useful, with a clear, defined study method presented, and even more tips and strategies for doing well.If you're going to get a book to help you ace the USMLE, there are better options out there."
2,Are there loose ends?,"To me, Endgame seemed unbelievably short for the final showdown of the FedCom Civil War. However, Coleman continues to surprise me, with his clear and concise editing. My only gripe is a certain flaw in the storyline: What happened to Colonel Christifori and the First Thorin? Throughout the Civil War, Christifori's character was built upon, until the final snapping point where he wanted to be there when ""the axe fell"".The axe has fallen all right. So where did Archer go? He was my personal favorite of the new characters introduced in the civil war. To see him disappear without a trace saddened me. Still, my compliments to each of the authors for a brilliant saga."
2,Gundam Fighting Game that out does any other.,"Lets start with the graphics. For a playstation game, the graphics remain very well done, with moving backgrounds, and awesome sound quality. All the flaws of the previous Gundam Battle Assault have been corrected, with larger selection of suits, slightly better storylines, and expanding levels, allowing much more mobility then the old game. Levels are more interesting, as are the mobile suits. ((Tallgeese III, Yeah!)). Otherwise it retains the classic fighting game with robots, save that with hand drawn and painstakingly detailed designs, the suits move, and sound, like the ones all the mecha fans know so well. I reccomend it for those that like Gundam, or any mecha, as well as those who miss the classic side scroll fighting games with truly challenging button combos."
2,2006 VW Jetta TDI 1.9L,"I've used Valvoline SynPower SAE 5W40 in my 2006 Jetta TDI from 50,000 to 70,000 miles. I think it's a great oil that holds up as good, if not better than, Castrol SLX or Pentosin. I'm not tearing the wheels off my car, but I have a two hour commute to work and I average about 75 to 80 MPH on the highway. The price is good also!"
1,Very D&D,"I am disappointed that Tor, who I have always considered a very high quality fantasy publisher, would put out this book. Upon opening it I am greeted with four or five maps of not only the world or a continent, but of towns and castles, all of which looked like things I drew to run my roleplaying world. On top of that we have references to stamina, and beauty, and agility--all the RPG stats. Yuck! This is badly written and poorly plotted."
1,Failed within a few days,"The unit stopped chirping within a few days. Fresh batteries did not revive it. Willing to try another, but there seems to be a quality control problem."
1,very forgettable,nothing special here.it's like 4 different movies in one.a little bit of everything that's been done before.but overall nothing really works.it's more like a ALbum than a real movie.very Predictable.
1,Mine only worked for 3 months,"My coffee maker only worked for three months.I don't know what exactly went wrong with it but after awhile, it took over 30 minutes to make a quarter pot of coffee.It did make great coffee while it lasted."
2,Great cookbook!,Great cookbook one of my favorites have made many reciepes from this book. This was a gift for my daughter
2,Captures the essence of casework and history,"One of the reasons people don't believe in ritual/cult abuse is because they don't -- or don't want to -- believe that there really are, in this day and age, cannibals: human beings who eat others of their own species. This book puts that lie to rest once and for all. I wish I had known there was a more current version of the book when I ordered this one (there is), but this particular version served its purpose for me. While the book itself does not address ritual/cult abuse specifically, it captures the essence of casework and history that involves more cannibal killers than I really wanted to know about. I kept turning the pages anyway. You will too."
1,Gould? Where?,"I must admit I dislike calling this work a real performance since it is not more than a series of MIDI sequences (there are many other sequences - and better - in the world!).Interpretation of the great ""Art of the Fugue"" here is sometimes poetic; the sound is nice, not excellent, and often the Author falls into something ridicolous, such as too much staccato at the end of Contrapuncto I after a lot of well balanced phrasings; or when he marks each theme with a lot of flourishes which have no sense in piano music, above all in the Disklavier music, etc.But the biggest mistake is to compare these ""performances"" with the Glenn Gould ones (see from the web). Also these are too metrical, too sequenced, too false. Sorry; and Gould was not a machine as the Author thinks."
2,Good for your mind,This and most every other FAX USA release Ive come across has appealed greatly to me.
2,Fantastic,"Most folk, Christians and non- Christians alike, have no idea of the spiritual warfare that the inhabitants of the planet face. The book, as is the case with the great majority of books written by this author, is a wake up call to serious, committed Christians who are on their individual, yet collective journey to Canan's land."
1,New Kindle,I ordered a new Kindle for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It was missing the power adapter to charge it. It will not charge via the USB port on my computer. This stinks because now I have to pay additional money to buy an adapter and she can't use it until it comes.
1,Godless?,"I don't think anyone is godless wether they go to church and pay the preacher man or don't believe in God they are subject to the same laws. Denying gravity exhists does not make one float in the air. Denying God exhists does not make God dissapear. Of course ""Religion and patriotism are the last refuges of the scoundrels"" and Ann Coulter is certainly one of those."
2,nice dish rack....but,"Before I bought it, I didn't notice there's no 'silverware' holder. Not a big deal since I use it for the occasional 'can't be in the dishwasher' stuff...and few spoons/forks or knives. Those who need a silverware holder might want to reconsider...but it looks so nice, is well made and isn't a dorky plastic rack like most...maybe use a glass or cup to hold the silverware to drip dry."
2,Enjoyable quick read!,I read this book within a day of receiving it as the semester had ended and I wanted to chill out.Enjoyed the book and will pass it on so that someone else can too. I like this type of thriller/political novel for my leisure reading.the cranky old lady
1,Gift,"This was a gift. I struggled through it. The fiction aspect was poorly written. The philosophical aspect seemed to come from Eric Berne's work. The historical references were way off from what is currently known about Peru and the dates involved. I personally found the jargon tedious. Characterization was thin. Once again, the Roman Catholic Church was the 'bad guy'. That also gets tiresome. So many people found this book to be helpful in their outlook on life so for that, I gave it 2 stars. For me --- it was much less enlightening and inspiring than other works I've read."
1,Don't pay $300 just google!,Do not pay $300.00 for this book. Most of these images are available when you google them. People are trying to make a profit at someone else's expense. Just google post-mortem pictures and they are all there!
2,BEST PEN EVER,"This is a great pen, I can use it to write notes directly in my bible and it drys super fast so doesn't bleed through. It's great for note taking. I have not found a pen to replace it and it is no longer stocked in regular stores. AMAZON thanks a bunch for stocking this item, it's great !!"
1,run on,"I'm afraid that in my opinion (only one person, admittedly) what works wonderfully in a magazine column makes poor book fodder. Though I wanted to look deeper, there was no surface to scratch....because underneath the brash, glitzy exterior of this novel is another surface: It is like a plastic onion in revealing lingerie. Those of you mining for nuggets of hard-won wisdom will probably go without. Some laughs, to be fair, several good ones.... but mostly sighs of boredom. Perhaps this is just the book the author had to get out the way before she could write something more worthy of her talents."
1,did not last,"I think it lasted maybe a week and then it fell apart. Good idea, look for something else dont waste your money on this one."
2,Gets the job done,"Works well with a decent range. All together, you get about 10ft of range with this device, which makes it easy for me to plug in my laptop to my TV and then sit back and browse with this keyboard.The feel of the keys is a little lacking. It seems like I make more typos with this keyboard."
2,sony clock radio icf c318,"When you pay $15 for anything, you can't expect state-of-the-art.That being said, the clock radio works fine, it does what it's supposed to do.Not the most user-friendly, since it's hard to manipulate, VERY light, and filled with buttons, which can be a challenge when you're half asleep."
2,Great support for parents of college bounds kids!,This book is a great support for parents with college bound kids. Well written and easy to read. Also contains tips for kids. Ms. Savage knows what she's talking about.
2,Well worth seeing,This was a good selection as a date night movie. Powerful acting from an all amateur cast which helped to make for a completely authentic and credible story line. Shame on us if people are still living like this anywhere in the US or on the fringes of the Mississippi.
1,Horrible quality,"If you are buying this as a toy then its perfect. If you are buying this for a young person taking lessons, forget it. The bridge fell off immediately. The pins do not hold the strings taught. Poor quality overall. I do not recommend for a lesson taker."
1,Just got mine an hour ago from Amazon,"Started off with a positive attitude until I got to the screwdrivers. After breaking my thumbnail in a couple places I finally gave up and got a small screwdriver in order to pry up any of the 3 blades. I've worked them back and forth and still the same. The smallest is the worst, no way to flip it up with a fingernail. The Phillips head on the other end is just fine. Guess I'll Email Leatherman tomorrow, if possible, and see what they say. I bought this under my wife's account, so if the review is under her name, let it be known we are talking a man's somewhat bigger, tougher thumbnail, not hers."
1,Plan Toy FAILURE. Go for the metal variety.,"I love Plan Toys but this one is a failure. It's irresponsibly designed in that the keys are random pitches, rather then ascending and descending tones. Other than how to bang on things, I'm not sure what Plan Toys is trying to teach children with this toy. Sure it's cute, but go for the metal, pitch perfect variety if you want any educational value. That'll hold an older toddler's attention as he or she grows and keep that developing brain engaged and enticed."
1,don't like taste at all,"I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better. I know taste preference is all subjective. But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point. After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it. I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters. I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low."
1,Good . . . until it dies,"No real complaints about the sound or distorted bass. The fit was also quite comfortable and with a somewhat extended commute, that's definitely something I appreciate. What I don't appreciate though is that after about 3 months, sound stops coming out of the left earbud because of the thin wiring and inadequate protection. I replaced one set of these and three months later, the exact same problem has arisen."
2,"For the price, you can't beat it","Ten bucks with free shipping available for a pistol case? Sure. This thing is sturdy and easily fits a handgun and maybe a clip or two, depending on the size of the weapon. Next to the handle is a small padlock hole, as well."
2,Stunning !!,These are the best one can get for an amazingly low price !!I got these for 9$ on free shipping. Has been 2 years and they still are GREAT !The best testimonial would be that my friend was thrown in the pool with my headphones on and believe me - the headphones survived !!Superb Bass.. I just got an Altec Lansing behind the neck headphones for 16$ but the max sound is so low... nowhere near the Bass and power of Philips HS500 !Hats off !!
2,What can you say about plastic sporks,"They do the job and held up under very cold weather. No problems with them in the dishwasher, either. Best price I've found for four."
1,Well...,"Well, the game's graphics are ok, but I think that the creators could have used satellite imaging to make real buildings. Outside of the big cities the buildings are the same. And there is no storyline or objectives, so if you want to be bored for half an hour, play this game."
1,Water Resistant?! Nice joke.,"Within the first month I had to replace this product because it had condensation on the inside. The customer service told me that it is not water resistant despite the logo of a guy swimming on the back of the watch and ""30 feet water resistant"". Just this week, after having been very careful not to get it wet, and taking it off before jumping in the shower, the new watch got more condensation in it and stopped working. It must have been the steam in the shower!! Terrible buy. I wish they would reimburse the purchase or issue a recall. This is not something an American company should be producing."
1,Accurate but hard to apply,"This book has a wealth of information about the complexities and nuances of matchpoint bridge. However, I found it to be rather difficult to extract from it many concrete rules or thought processes to use in making decisions at the table. It has lots of examples of what to do to get the best score but insufficient breakdown of the things to analyze to make the right choices.I have not yet found a better book on this subject, but I feel that I got little out of this one."
2,Awesome pillow!,"Finally I can get the rest I need. I was contemplating on what type of pillow to buy to help alleviate my neck and back pain. I have to say my search is over. This pillow may weigh a few pounds a smell a little funny but it is by far the most comforting. They way it conforms to my head wether I'm laying on my side or back is just right. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase and I'm actually sleeping a lot longer without getting up throughout the night tossing and turning. Oh and one last thing, this pillow actually stays cool even during the day!"
1,Poor Condition,"The recipes are good. I ordered this one for my daughter so she doesn't need to keep borrowing mine, but it is in awful condition, so bad it should not have been sold to anyone."
1,Was this really a big album?,"I decided to venture beyond the artists I usually listen to (U2, Nicki Minage, alternative, etc.) So I picked up Born to Run thinking that this was a slice of true americana that certainly would not disappoint. I was wrong. This album was literally hurtful to my ears. I put it on in the car and my wife immediately turned it down and said ""who the hell is this?"""
1,"Cool idea, terrible controllers.","I loved the idea of the glowing controllers. They look cool when lit up and work pretty nicely. Except for the fact that the joysticks break off of the metal part after about 3 months. It seems to be just a cheap plastic housing that connects the joystick to the actual metal piece that moves. I received them as a gift for christmas with my xbox. I loved them. The white one broke after about 3 months, and I thought I had just gotten a bad pair of them. I bought another package and they worked great. Until they both broke. Cool idea, complete waste of money. Too flimsy and the joysticks are barely held onto the controller."
1,CHEAP METAL,This clock is made of cheap metal. I wound it up and the alarm won't ring because of the cheap metal.
2,Princess dress-up,I bought this for my almost 3 year old granddaughter for christmas. She loves playing dress-up. Some of the accessories she didn't know what to do with them so they get thrown to the side. The card board trunk is hard to figure out how to put together. I didn't know you would have to tape it when I bought it. It took both my husband and I to get it figured out. I had to hold parts together while he taped. The trunk is not very durable. Overall I would recommend it.
2,excellent!!! ....tips though...,"if you really want to go through all projects, especially the first ones, buy this book first ####Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software###. i find the two to be a great combination. after reading the code book, the first projects on hardware will be to easy. even the rest actually."
2,It was good!,"I have read every book on the Oprah list except Paradise, and have found all of them too be good. I was expecting more out of this novel than i received. It was a wonderful novel, but could have been more.WHen I began reading it I had a hard time getting into it but once i got in it, I couldn't get out. I felt the pain and abuse that ""Beth,"" had endured. The ending was a little expected and I was able to figure out most of the book before it happened.NOnetheless i recommend the book..."
2,Great news,"These work great with Pull-ups. The Pull-ups stays dry and you just change the liner. You can use 1Pull-up and 3-4 liners during the day. It's too hard to change Pull-ups after dressing for the day. This is great, just change the liner and go on your way. I was just on a Sightseeing trip and enjoyed myself without worrying about an accident. I have MS. Unfortunately I just found out they're being discontinued."
1,I'll be renting this version and buying the extended version when...,"Ah, the greed of mankind is not to be underestimated! I do so agree that this little dwarf's purse strings will not be unwound till the extended blu ray edition is released.... thanks to all the others who protest this mean mean move by the studio."
2,Handy iPAQ accessory,This foldable keyboard is great for allowing the use of your PDA as a mini notebook. It is compact and light. I use it when I am flying. It is also great at home when I have large entries to make because it has a jack that allows for the iPAQ to run on AC instead of the battery.
2,What A Book!,"This book is SOO timely; not necessarily because of the boy meet girl theme, but because in this book, someone dies and it sobers you; Just this year alone for me, I have known seven people to die. Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real."
1,"don't buy, brakes too easily","Three weeks after I bought this headset, the plastic inside the microphone handle broke. I fixed it with tape, but it affected the quality of the call (people would not be able to understand me properly, unless I would hold the handle). I emailed the company and sent them pictures of it. they were really nice and sent me a new one. only a few weeks later the new headset broke at the same place as the old one. I emailed the company again and got a second replacement, which is now broken too!the quality of the plastic that holds the microphone handle in place is not good enough.if you don't mind fixing the headset with tape once it brakes and then hold on to the handle while you're talking, this is a good headset ;-)"
1,Product wouldn't work.,Product wasn't new as advertised. It didn't work and was missing parts. My money still hasn't been returned .Beware this seller.
2,A good sample CD of one of the greatest labels around,"The first CD of this sampler is quite good. The project that stands out the most in my mind is Sephiroth. And Raison d'etre is amazing as usual. The second CD however is not as good. There are at least two songs on it that are absolutely atrocious. Nevertheless,this sampler should still be purchased because of its relatively low price, the wonderful packaging, and, as mentioned before, the first CD."
1,not worth it,This book was not worth waiting for. I'm returning it for a refund. I will never read any of her work again.
1,I can't believe this got these many good reviews,"This is a very poor ""mystery"" novel. If you want to read about how God saves - get this book - you will love it. If you love a good plot - forget it!!!!!"
2,"Mesmerizing, Beautfully Subdued, Wow","This is the best album I've heard in a long time. It is one of those that transcends any specific genre. It's live studio sound is amazing, I love the production on this album. Solomon Burke has perhaps the greatest soul voice of all time. It is so powerfull and delicately restrained at the same time. The only reason a fan of Blues or Soul music would not like this album is because they would expect a much more oversampled and mixed album........but in my opinion the live bone cut recording of this album is one of its greatest assets. Wow. Thank you Solomon and Joe Henry and............"
2,Sassy heroine and humerous story,"2nd in the Stephanie Plum series. I listened to this book on audio cassette with narration by C.J. Critt. Cute story that moves along quickly - full of spunky characters and humor. I love getting to know Stephanie's family, especially Grandma Mazur. The voice actor does a good job with all the major voices and makes them believable. I can't wait for things to heat up between Stephanie and Joe Morelli! Now it's on to the next one, ""Three to Get Deadly""."
2,"Best since ""Read My Mind""","Reba's finally matched my favorite CD ""Read My Mind"". This album displays her talents, mostly on the songs ""'Til I Said It To You"", ""I'll Be"", ""What Do You Say"", and ""We're All Alone"". A clever collection of ballads put together the best CD in a long time... ""So Good Together."" Keep up the great work REBA!"
2,702's Star Shines Here!!!,"I remember this album when I was 10th grade. I played this album so much that it is clearly a masterpiece. This album is a fresh twist on R&B and hip-hop. The 16-track album boasts the same fun-loving,spiritedness that we have come to expect from the group. Same spirit,and a new mature edge. They put their experiences into words and penned 4 of the 16 tracks. Listen as this album give you eargasmic pleasure. This album should have been promoted more. Remember,this was 2003."
1,"Great Idea, bad product",I really thought it would be nice and cheaper to use a coffee of my choice but found out that the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter is messy and hard to clean. You have to change out a attachment on your machine to use this which is another inconvenience plus I always wind up with coffee grains in my cup and the coffee comes out weak. I like the idea but this gadget is not the answer.But as far as the Keurig coffee maker goes it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
1,Utter Crap,"I can't think of a single cd that is worse than this piece of crap. ""I Hate Everything About You""? ""Just Like You""? All the songs sound the same and are the same, lyrically. They are just saying ""Life sucks and I hate everything."" What is the point. Such depressing subject matter would be alright if the music that went along with the lyrics would be good. This is not the case. All the guitar parts sound the same, the drumming is uninspired and the bass is laughable. I wouldn't touch this cd with a ten foot crap pole, and I would hope that if this review would stop 1 person from buying this, then I can die happy."
2,Who was Jason Zacharias?,"That riddle was the key to Noel Emery's frightening predicament. Ever since she'd arrived in Britain, she'd been plunged into chaos, pursued by assasins. And her guardian angel was a seasoned veteran of murder....and a man who claimed to be her husband.Had Noel once shared lovers' caresses with the dark, dangerous Jason Zacharias? Or was the straining sensuality between them just an illusion? The answer was locked in the best of all hiding places - her mind. A mind that now scrambled fantasy and memory.Noel's only way out of the maelstorm was to trust her heart - and her life - to a man who pretended to be a protector but who looked every inch a predator."
2,"Great Box Set, A must for your collection",This is a great collection of John Lee Hooker to covers his entire career. This is a must for all John Lee Collectors.
2,"Great, heavy duty, stitching!","My dog breaks through the stitching of 'squeaker' toys pretty quickly. However the stitching on this product is really good. When the squeaker inevitably died, and I had to replace it, it was actually harder to open than most.I'm removing a star because the squeaker broke. I also wish (the squeaker) was bigger, matching the proportion of the toy better."
1,This CD iz Aight...........,FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT.....

1,Review of Chamberlain Garage Door Monitor,"Very disappointed in purchase. Actual item does not match picture shown.Deceptive Advertising. I even wrote and reported this issue, but todate nothing has been changed or rectified. It's so simple too. Justlook at the item pictured, it appears white, which is what I wanted.After receiving the product, it was actually tan, so I had to send itback."
2,These Guys are Close To The Best!,"I bought this CD based on some of the other rave reviews. At first I kept comparing the singers to other superb groups like Ian and Sylvia, The Kingston Trio, The Limeliters, The Weavers, and Peter Paul & Mary. But, finally during one listening session with this CD, I was able to forget about these other groups so as to be able to enjoy these guys on their own terms as musicians and singers. And, I had to admit, ""yes, they are very good."" Get this CD for great guitar playing and the beautiful voices. I enjoy listening to this CD and you will also! Email address is gourmet72141@yahoo.co"
1,Washed out photos - poor quality for a kodak,"I got this camera as a christmas gift this year and was fairly pleased. I had been shopping around for a camera to make slideshows with, and my parents very generously bought one for me. I am no expert in photography, but I know when a camera takes bad pictures. I have an olive skin tone and green eyes, and the pictures completely washed out my skin, leaving only my eyes with color. Also, pictures of subjects farther away than 28"" came out dark and/or washed out as well. The color saturation is overwhelming, and I just couldn't take it. After a few trade ins between a couple other cameras I have finally stuck with a Sony Cyper-shot, which is a good camera. The kodak C330 is good for those who are looking for a bargain, and don't care about true to color skin tones. But if you'd like to save a hundred dollars, stick with Kodak's disposable cameras and you'll get better pictures."
2,Great movie for anyone who's ever been alone.,"If you've ever been alone, you can really sympathize with Lars. If you're socially awkward as well, then you'll love the movie even more. Regardless of whether you're like the main character though, I think you'll love the movie."
1,Does anyone know what this is?,"If this is the same one that Jeffery Forrester did in the 80's, I will buy it. Amazon - could you provide a little more information for us? I will be glad to give it a full review when I get it."
2,Very Underrated Artist,I got to Hear His stuff when I was a Little boy thanks to My Mother.back then Radio gave everybody a chance&you had to bring the goods&Walter Jackson did.He had a Cool Vocal Delievery.the music is still very soulful&right on time.Artists like Him shouldn't be overlooked they have alot going for them if given a fair chance.
1,"terrible tape hiss, and Bjoeling is all wrong for the tenor","There is a lot of tape hiss that is very annoying. But even more of a fault is poor Jussi Bjoeling. Once the greatest tenor in the world. He shouts his big aria and the two B's are strain. Price is beautiful, but she is not enough to save the set."
1,More quasi-Mexican hoo-ha.,"Another yawn-fest of boring pseudo-folk songs from this overrated Tucson band. White people professing their Hispanic influences is about as valid as Vanilla Ice pretending to be down with the 'hood, and using a Mariachi band as back-up musicians is just as offensive as John Courgar Mellencamp utilizing gospel singers to make it seem like he's a funk soul brother. Sorry, Calexico, but you're Gringos and you always will be--no amount of lyrics about migrant workers eating tortillas is ever going to change that. On top of this, the music is so laid-back, so devoid of energy, it's positively coma-inducing. It makes Giant Sand sound like Metallica. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
1,requeim from the darkness - turmoil lf the flesh (vol.1) + series box,"this is one of those scams they tell you about. this is one disck. and a box that holds 4 discks. you can buy the only dick in this set for much cheaper and not alot of extra cardboard.so to review, scam scam scam."
2,Excellent overview of tournament play,"This is a great book on NLHE tournament strategy. It has an easy-to-read style, and focuses on advanced topics. This is probably not a beginner's book, but will be very helpful to intermediate and advanced players. I consider this to be the best poker book I have ever read, and I've read most of them. Even if your style differs from Harrington's (and he does tend to be of a more conservative mentality than most), this book will absolutely add to your game."
1,Classic Movie,This movie is a little slow for my taste. Doesn't really live up to my expectations especially given the director and star.
1,Don't say a word? Dont expect much,"Conceptually, this movie is fantastic: To save his kidnapped daughter, a child psychologist must pry a sequence of numbers from the mind of a seemingly psychotic and thoroughly overmedicated and messed up young girl.Notice I said ""conceptually."" Keep reading my review.Based on this premise, what I was expected was tense drama and suspense as Michael Douglas attempts to forge a bond with the girl to unlock the mysteries of her past and convince her to reveal her secrets. What I got was completely unrealistic--the girl's trust solidified in a matter of moments, leading to a completely predictable, formulaic conclusion.Come on. The only time people open up like that is when they're on Jerry Springer. Had I known that this movie was directed by the same director that ruined the book, ""Kiss The Girls"", I may not have rented it at all.Conclusion: If you're curious, rent it. This is not something with a lot of playback appeal."
1,Am I the only one disappointed?,"Really, really disappointing, and this from a true-blue SDRE fan. How It Feels To Be Something On was not great but this new release is quite simply bad. Maybe I'm stuck in the past but is there anyone else out there that misses the SDRE sound of the first two CD's like I do? These new songs are boring, even tedious, and what's up with Enigk's voice? It's higher, even to the point of shrillness now."
1,"Gamasonic GS-29W Solar- Powered LED Spotlight, White Bulb","It does not stay lite more than 2 hours and the light is very low, even when I place it facing the Sun and move it around to continue receiving the Sun Rays.I had to purchase an electric one.I would like to return it for a refund.Can you please send me a Return Authorization Form? Thank youBest regardsAmado Palavicini"

1,Do not buy!,"Vidal Sasson VS184C Gold Series Professional Three-Barrel WaverThis product is a waste of money, it overheats and smokes and burns out your hair. This product is a household hazard and do not recommend this to anyone!"
2,Very Nice,"Very Nice looking, Review dimension. Clock a little small, but looks great. Very well made. Keeps time great and look good on the mantle."
1,I'd rather sleep,than read this book again. This is one person that should go to Vo Tech if you know what I mean. The book seems to sleepwalk through most parts. They made a movie about this nightmare?
1,Lasted less than 1 minute before it died...,"i wired it up, it worked, so i was going to wire up the light next, nothing worked, then i just did the unit itself again w/o the light, nothing worked...dead in a couple minutes...not the best product in the world..."
2,Exactly what we needed.,"We are very pleased with these cabinet locks. They are functional and inexpensive. It seemed destructive and time-consuming to drill safety locks into the cabinet. This functions just as well without the hassel and damage. They are easy to use. Definitely recommend. We bought a couple, tested them and immediately bought more."
1,very disappointed,"My 89 year old mother loves Claude King's Wolverton Mountain. Hasspecial memories for her from 1961. So I was pleased to see it here with some other good country hits. I didn't realize I was getting a tape, thought I was getting a CD but that was my fault for not paying attention.What wasn't my fault, however, was I thought I was getting the original recordings but they are all remakes. They're awful. I think they should put that in BOLD LETTERS-REMAKE! Don't waste your money."
1,do NOT buy this movie if you love animals,"While there is some ""campy"" value in seeing Frankie Avalon in a safari pic .... the failings far out weigh any other value the film may have.This pic includes some actual footage shot in Africa, and the rules about filming animals were much different then. This film contains actual footage of an Elephant being shot in the head and killed.Do NOT buy this movie if you like animals. The scenes will stay with you. Very disturbing."
2,Smith's Genius,"Elliot Smith has never written anything but beautiful, listenable music and this first release is no exception. His fan base should only grow. He was a genius."
1,It takes two,It takes two to use this book and I am not able to get him to the table. I wish there was something I could buy that he would read. Then maybe he would come part way. So far this ain't the book for me. Make sure both of you are willing to work together before you buy this book.
2,Awesome Sprayer,I've seen these at home shows for at least $30. But they are a little bulky. This product is smaller and does the same job as my friends who has the other model. They like mine better :)
2,The best book about world explorers that you can find.,"Off the Map is a wonderfll book. It is basically a summary of world exploration from Marco Polo in 1271 to Umberto Nobile in 1928. There are separate chapters about each explorer, all arranged in chronological order with each chapter about 10-20 pages each. The chapter lengths are just right in that they are not too long, but also not lacking for detailed information. Each chapter also has a map that illustrates where the particular explorer travelled, which was extremely helpful. There are also 3 separate sections of illustrations and photos which helps give a visual picture of the explorers.Overall, this book is packed with information and is written in such a way that each chapter is told like a story and each story takes you back in time to a different era. If you are intertested in world exploration or world history, then this book is a must read. I enjoyed it very much."
1,Not like the show,The show is amazing and it's good to have the episodes so you can watch them anytime. However be aware that this is a DVD-R that has extremely poor picture quality. Very bad! Also the ZZ Top theme song is gone and the episodes are labeled incorrectly in the menu.The Duckmen deserve better and hopefully they will be able to release a proper Season 1 soon.
2,Plug N Play Defined,"Though I'm a software developer, I don't know much about networking, MAC addresses, DNSs, etc. Rather, I'm too lazy to learn what my peers already know. I had my fingers crossed when I bought this one, based on the reviews I read here. Well, it took some time, but I got the thing to work. And by ""some time"", I mean roughly 30 seconds. Here's what I had to do:1. Open it.2. Plug it into the wall and the Xbox3. Turn on the Xbox4. Click the blue button till the display read ""In"".5. Play games.It really is that easy. I don't even know if it has directions or not, as I never read any. I just glanced at the back of the packaging for the ""In"" instruction. This is worth every penny. I chose this over the MS brand one simply for the fact that this unit may have some re-use down the road if my Xbox becomes ""unnecessary"". This is a great product, don't pass it up."
2,Big hit with 15 year old,"I purchased this book for my ""rock and roll"" loving nephew for his 15th birthday. This seemed to really hit the mark as a cool gift. He loved it."
1,Dont waste your money on this - buy Kitchenaid instead,"I purchased the Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 12-Piece Cookware Set from Amazon.com in 2009 and about last year, the hard anodized coating started peeling from one of the pans. OK - one is an anomaly. Then this happened on another of the utensils in the set and now almost every piece has its coating peeling off. Note that I also bought a comparable KitchenAid set at the same time and those are doing great. I can definitely confirm that I have not used any metal cookware with these and I have not put them in the dishwasher. Is this a common issue or did I get a bad batch??"
1,"Horrible, manipulative, does damage to the cause of Christ","This book, along with anything else written by C.S. Lovett, is a terrible, evil example of evangelism. The author cites specific techniques to manipulate people into making a serious decision. The ""evangelist"" walks away thinking he's done good for the Kingdom. The ""convert"" walks away feeling bruised, bullied, confused, and glad it's over. This is a great technique if you want numbers. It is a horrible technique if you want changed lives. There is no magic prayer that makes you a Christian. Repeating some words because somebody put their hands on your shoulder and said, ""Repeat after me. Lord... I'm... a sinner...,"" doesn't make me a Christian any more than reading Marx outloud makes me a communist."
1,"Angry, unresearched slop",This author simply rants and raves about everyone she dislikes - which is just about everybody to the right of a Unitarian or Gay Studies professor. There is no serious statics or social research in this book. A sloppy effort by a marginal writer published by a marginal company.
1,This product will melt,"This is a great product until it melts. My son saved his own money and purchased it. A few months later it melted. I have read several posts about this happening a lot. I would not purchase again, it is not safe."
1,Ridiculous ending!,"This book had an intriguing plot - that a 13-year-old would seek medical empanciation from her family so she could make her own decision about donating an organ to her sister. It held my interest. The ending, however, was out of left field and a complete betrayal of everything that had gone before. Scratch Jodi Picoult off my list of authors!"
2,Works great!,"This is an exceptional hair gel. It holds well without being gummy or sticky, and easily washes out leaving no residue."
2,Thrilling Sex Scenes!,I am a person who loves losing myself inside someone elses world for a few blissful hours each day as I unwind from my day's work. Books like FRIENDLY ENEMIES by Victoria Taylor Murray is the reason why I enjoy books of this nature. If you haven't had a chance to read any of her stories yet this is the perfect book to begin with. You're gonna love it!
2,Visually Stunning,"My granddaughter and I watched this movie together. It is beautifully done, with an appealing cast of characters. I absolutely loved this movie!"
1,Lousy and pretentious,"This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. Absolutely boring, lame movie about the life of privileged people. Maybe they think this is entertaining, but this is one of those films you will swear you've seen before. Just don't even bother. BTW, what man isn't like this guy? Give me a break."
1,They stick it to you with impossible-to-open bottle.,"I spent a full hour twisting the cap every which way and still have been unable to open it. There are no instructions for opening anywhere on the bottle or cardboard packaging. Who cares how strong the glue is inside if you can't ever get to it? ADDED NOTE: With many months having elasped since I originally posted this review, I see that this and the one other highly critical review were both marked ""unhelpful."" Could it be that employees of the manufacturer give negative reviews a low ranking? It seems hard to believe that so many people would find it unhelpful to be warned that a glue product might arrive with the cap stuck closed, rendering the product useless. Granted, I might have received one faulty container -- an exception to the other ones that open with no problem -- but, well, I'm just saying . . ."
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Fundamentals","I bought an Aiwa product and experienced very poor quality. The stereo cuts out at higher volumes. Also the CD player is already broken after 2 years. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was attracted to the good sound and even better price, it looks like I got what I paid for. Bad product components from inadequate power supply to poor quality of moving parts even worse customer support. There is no reason a piece of electronics should fail after two years."
1,Lousy product,Pro:-Works with the Samsung BeatCon:-Don't stay in your earl well even in sitting still position.-Occasionally hear echo of yourself.-Take too long to turn ON/OFF (8-10 sec).-Volume buttons not sensitive enough to adjust easily.-Call button is over sensitive and have accidentally make calls without realizing.
1,Christianity as it truly is!,"About this awful book, it must be also said that it was written at a time without political correctness, and whites didn't care then about what we African would think about their hate against us. (and they never believed we ""savages"" would ever also be able to read their books.) So this is why it is important you read this awful book and see clearly how much Christianity hates us and is used by white to control, enslave us. You will never hear missionary and priests say this so clearly nowadays. But Christianity in its core has not changed and remain the imperialistic, hateful, killing religions and cultures that is exposed in this book by a Christian pastor who is not ashamed of his hate and exposes the Christian plan to murder the African soul."
1,Definatley not worth the price they are asking now,Ok I bought this book over a year ago from Swagrox I think I paid maybe like twenty bucks for it.. I have been a huge Nikki Sixx fan since Too Fast For Love came out.. and i had to buy it. Its NOT a very good book.. most the information in there is common knowledge and after reading The Dirt you know more about him than what you may learn from this book. The author did a HORRID job.. theres spelling errors and other huge mistakes in there.. I'm pretty sure a trained monkey could have done a better job. Even the font that they printed it in is lame... looks like some teenager with poor eyesight typed it.. in the dark with one arm?? I can't believe these people are asking that much for this book.. its NOT worth it..trust me
2,Worked for me.,"I scored 684 on my GED. I would actually say that the test questions on the book were harder than the actual test.What is most important when reading the question in this book, and the test itself, especially in ""controversial"" areas such as social studies etc, is that you can ignore whatever ""biases"" you have (or perceive the book to have, even though this perception is likely to your own biases) by carefully reading the question and ONLY considering the aspects that the question raises. So take the practice exams on the CD-ROM, read and truly try to understand any questions you might have got wrong, because within the content of the question there should not be many answers assumed incorrectly by McGraw-Hill. I think I counted only couple of question from all of them that had the 'wrong' answer, to best of my knowledge. Still, I think it was a great study book."
1,"Kinesio Tex Tape, Black",I bought this tape to try it out after using KT Tape. I will not use this tape again. The tape lasted all of 1 day before it started to peel off my skin. I previously used KT Tape i bought from sports authority and that would stay on my ankle for at least 4 days even after getting the tape wet.
1,HOW DARE YOU CALL YOUR ALBUM ROCK AND ROLL JESUS,Motley Crue are and will always be the rock genius's God is God kid rock should not have called his album that. White Trash
2,Best bird feeder I have ever seen or used.,"Perhaps a bit expensive, but really really well worth it. Very well made. Superb design. We've used ours for many months and remain very well pleased. Everything the Brome people say about this feeder has proven to be true. At the first good excuse, I trashed another piece of junk feeder and purchased another Brome. We like it, our guests like it, and our birds like it. Note; per the instructions, it should be cleaned on occasion - an amazingly simple procedure."
2,Perfect Goggles,I've swam all my life and these are really high quality goggles. They fit great. They keep the water out. And they're really easy to see out of. Couldn't be happier.
1,great sound if you're home,"Sound is terrific but only in the quiet of your home. Any, and I mean any outside noise and forget it, even at high volume you can't hear the music. Forget about using them on a jet, all you hear is the engine. Plus the ear pieces are constantly falling off no matter what size, any ear bud that goes into the ear canal work much much better to isolate outside noises. Too bad, in the quiet of your room the sound is great, but that's about it."
2,Good old fashioned sci fi with a touch of humour,"Strata follows an old plan of putting some interesting characters together and then sending them on a journey/quest where they have to learn to trust each other to survive. Mind you it is sci fi so the characters are 2 possibly very dangerous aliens and a 800 year old engineer who makes worlds and the journey is across a flat Earth [Terry Pratchett does seem to have a problem with curvature]. The cream on the top is the Prachett repartee and out of left field situations. Ending a bit vague for me but a fun read if you grew up on the works of Asimov, Zelazney and Niven etc."
1,Not as good as the original,"I was disappointed in this version of the Gizmo. I had the original and loved it. My old one, you just put into the base and it automatically got charged. This new Gizmo needs to have the power cord connected to it manually before placing it in the base. Also, the power doesn't seem as strong as the older one. It took a lot longer to scramble eggs. I really miss my old Gizmo!"
2,An Excellent Read,"This is a very entertaining book. It may start out a bit slow but picks up quickly. I ususally read to put myself to sleep, but this one kept me up past my bedtime!"
1,A word of caution,"I always thought Commander X was that shorter guy always in sunglasses that frequently appeared on those discovery channel shows, now in ""UFO Hunters."" Guess not. Although I was pleased to get the cool pink copy of the book I found myself slipping into a maze after trying to read his books. There was something very obtrusive about them. They were also a little scattered, a hodge podge of personal whims and ""new age"" research. Most everything he says is taken straight from another book. (Which you can find on Amazon.) They are very misleading, I guess unless your heading in that direction. Now Im sitting here trying to figure out what to do with them. Should I spred the junk for another poor innocent victim, ahould I burn them, should I keep them in my bedroom and let them consume me...????!!"
2,True to life Christmas stories for adults.,This collection of short stories captures your heart because the stories reflect genuine feelings. Everyone will be able to relate to these stories and the memories they invoke. The true spirit of Christmas is demonstrated in a realistic and heartwarming way in stories ranging from lighthearted to poignant. Reading this book will become a Christmas tradition. Suemary Vance M.D.
1,Avoid Kindle in Australia,Great product - but the poor availability and high cost of books for download in Australia is a problem. Before you consider buying in Australia (particularly if it is a gift) check the availability and cost of books. They are up to twice the price of books in America in $US before the exchange rate is considered.
1,Reviews,"I still havn't recieved it yet, and it said it will come by january 22nd. Hopefully i will recieve it in the next few days."
1,Please enter a title for your review:,"People talk about M.I.A. being political but it's virtually impossible to make out a word she talk-sings. Most of her vocals are repetitive looped chants with a ridiculous level of reverb that drains all humanity out of her voice, and all these sparse percussive mid-tempo barely-songs sound the same. If you've heard half a song you've heard them all. I don't understand how anyone could endure the monotony of this record, let alone find anything to enjoy in it. It is somewhat original, but mostly for the fact that it sounds like someone let their kid loose in the recording studio."
1,Ok Seatcovers,I bought these floormats to go with the hearts seatcover but was more satisfied with the seatcover than these floormats. First of all they don't stay in place and the quality is not the greatest. For the price I would recommend you buy something else.
1,Horrible!!,Bought this filter to clean approximately 25 gallons and it stopped working in 12 hours. The draw is horrible and it is very loud. Save your money!!!!!
1,Very poorly written,"The stories and accounts (and gossip) in this book are presented very poorly. The organization of the book is incoherent and the author is not presenting the stories with an unbiased eye. He frequently engages in critical assessments of the women in the affairs as ""beautiful"" or ""ugly,"" ususally presented as his opinion instead of what others' accounts of the women actually were. His sources of information are dubious and highly suspect. I really would not suggest this book at all. This is a very interesting subject given by an author with a complete lack of story-telling ability."
2,Lessons for all Americans,"Length:: 2:24 MinsAs an American living abroad, and a Foreign Service hopeful, I thought that The Ugly American contained lessons for all Americans the importance of our foreign policy as well as how our policies are administered throughout the world."
1,What a cast!!!!!!! too bad terrible script,"If you like the cast, thats all you get. The script is just so poor. I imagine these actors just said what the hell they are paying us, but this movie is not the quality you expect from these artist. Rent it cheap if you still want to see it any other option will leave you feeling cheated"
2,Great but it's another opportunity missed.,"If you bought any of the recent Who remasters you probably noticed that certain key singles were conspicuous by their absence in the bonus tracks added onto the end of the CDs - neither Substitute nor Happy Jack on ""A Quick One""; no Pictures of Lily on ""Sell Out""; no Let's See Action on ""Who's Next"" - this was done on purpose so you'd have to buy this latest hits compilation. Brian O'Marra (see below) is quite right to criticise the omission of (The) Relay and the needlessness of including album tracks like Baba O'Riley. But, yes, it's the only place you can find the remastered Substitute 45 - so you'll probably get it anyway. MCA/Polydor have had numerous attempts at doing the definitive Who hits album, and every one just misses out on being definitive. So it's 4 stars for being close but cigarless."
1,for whom the bell tolls,"the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?"
1,I can't give her just one star because I love her so much,"I love Anne Rice, I mean LOVE her stories! However, this one was well....bad. Actually, it put me to sleep (and I am an insomniac). I couldn't find any story in it. It was pretty words but no depth. It was telling us something we already know. The worst part was being too long winded. I know, she is long winded anyway, but it usually pays off. This one didn't. I read Memnoch and was disappointed there too (though not as bad as Pandora) and Violin was awful. Please please please, Ms. Rice....write like you used to! Your books (the old ones) are what made me want to be a writer! Please!"
2,superb,brilliant just sheer heavy rap metal! best songs are testify gurellia radio calm like a bomb and i like born of a broken man personally must get best RATM cd
2,The Best Tenor in 2002,This CD is John McDermott at his very best. The smooth mellow tones of this Scottish Tenor are excellent on The Battle Hymn of the Republic and The Old Man.His a capella version of Danny Boy can not be beat.This CD is a must. From the stories told in the songs to the comforting sound of McDermotts great voice you will find yourself very glad you purchased it.
2,AMAZING BARGAIN!!!!,"Truely one of the best bargains out there. They just don't have the name recognition. Beautiful cosmetics. Good bass so don't put them too close to the corners of the room if your hanging them on the wall up near the ceiling. Great build quality. I will tell you that for my taste, they are the maximum size that I would want to go with for surrounds. They are built this size for a reason, BIG sound!"
2,Excellent reading,"One of Mr Saul's best. It was a hard book to put down, always wanting to know what was going to happen next."
1,Worst Spongebob & Worst Christmas Show Ever!,"My family all loves Spongebob, but this was the worst Spongebob and worst Christmas show we've ever seen. Not funny, but the look and songs are very irritating, and the songs are most of the show - very little dialog."
2,I've read it 3 times!,"Even if you know what happens you can't put this book down. ""Touching the Void"" prompts you to dip deep into your own ""what if..."" world. A ""must read"" for anyone who truly LIVES this one life we have. Climbing, heck even hiking, is not a pre-req to loving this book. Give as a gift and Joe's words will inspire everyone you know."
1,"Didn't get what I wanted, very misleading and mistrustful!!","You don't get envelopes and cards when you order, only cards... and who needs just cards??!!Instead, you should get what the picture shows, matched envelopes with cards. What an idea, huh?"
1,Very Disappointing Book for the Money,"The book was purchased with the hope that it would be a step by step guide in setting up Joomla!. Unfortunately, it does not even come close. The book is nothing more than a re-print of the Joomla help website and the websites of additional modules. The book contains no step by step instruction on building content - just a description of what each screen does. Even that is not in much detail. Save your money and wait for a better manual to come along."
2,My Students Love This!,"As a Title 1 teacher, I see groups of 3-5 kids in blocks of 30 minutes to 1 hour per day. My students love to be assigned a part(or two). Most stories have 5-6 speaking parts, and all of the stories have some sort of a moral. The reason why my students seem to enjoy these plays so much is that they get a chance to ""shine"" in these high interest tales.A regular teacher with a larger class could effectively use this book during a center time activity, or at any time when groups are split up during a language arts block. This book will breathe a bit of fresh air into your lesson plans!"
2,Sling Blade,Just another item that my son asked for for Christmas! No where else to find it at such a great price! Speedy delivery! Awesome!
1,choking hazard?,"My five month-old loves this little bee; however, he can get the blue ""wing"" all the way into his mouth. Because of its shape, he has trouble pulling it out and chokes on it. I didn't use it for a long time because it was too heavy for him and it looks like I'll be putting it up again. The choking really scared me."
1,"Inflammatory, poorly reasoned, not worth time to read","In my opinion, this book is racist, misogynist trash wholly unworthy of any thinking person's reading time. Steyn premises this book on fundamentalist theocon generalizations and stereotypes about Middle Eastern peoples and then invents wildly improbable ""demographics"" to bolster his conclusions. Johann Hari put it best when he said ""Europe cannot defeat the far-right poison of Islamic fundamentalism by turning to a parallel far-right mythology of its own. Once before we logged the race of babies. Once before we invented conspiracies like the Protocols of the Elders of Mohammed peddled by Steyn. It is a startling indictment of the intellectual standards of the American right that they have welcomed this Eurabian fiction with anything other than cheap, repulsed laughter."""
2,"Dependable, easy-to-clean colander","It's as solid as it looks, with well-defined perforations that are very easy to clean. The feet are useful for draining anything in the sink without the drained food soaking in its water. The product photograph is highly accurate--after many uses and many washes, it's very easy to keep it looking this polished with nothing more than soap and water."
1,Save your money and go diving.,"Divemaster gets drunk here. Divemaster gets drunk there. Divemaster gets laid. Divemaster makes fun of fat people.That's pretty much it. This collection of anecdotal stories has little if any point, and goes nowhere. Rather than the travelogue of interesting dive locales it claims to be, Rapture Of The Deep is little more than the kind of macho posturing you can find in any bar near any decent dive operator, but less interesting.You won't find idea for dive trips, and you won't find useful insights about diving or divers. If you feel you must read this, at least buy one of the used copies, as I guarantee they've never been read more than once."
2,Deborah Gibson Movie!,"A recommended movie for fans of pop icon, Deborah Gibson. An indie film that was first released on VHS is now on DVD. A better representation from it's first format since it's now on Dolby Digital; in terms of picture and sound quality. Take note of the title track sang by Deborah as well. All in all, it's a light, fun movie about relationships. The actors did a great job; Although, because of it's gay-themed undertones; it's suitable for mature audiences only. Great DVD quality but no added features."
1,Not as good as I expected..,I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it.I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..
1,Unable to rate item. Rating is for the vendor,"Do not order this item from this vendor. I ordered it a few weeks ago and it never shipped. They kept promising to ship the item but never did. My order was cancelled. If you want this item for Christmas, you should order it from someplace else."
1,Yawn,"I really wanted to like this book because it had been recommended to me by several people, but I just couldn't get into it. I was a little annoyed by Cannie's character who is pretty immature. But mostly, I was just bored with this book because not a lot happens. Judging from the other reviews, I guess this is a book that one will either love or hate. With so many terrific books out there I don't see why anyone should waste their time with this one. Maybe I just don't get the ""chic lit"" genre."
2,Excellent product... it your cat is normal.,"This is a wonderful product. It runs quietly, is easy to fill, and most cats will think it's great since it keeps the water tasting fresh.That being said, it did not work out for my cat, who, in all fairness, is not the sharpest tool in the shed. While most cats will happily drink from the Catit by licking the dome, our cat attacked it on several occasions, beating it with his paws and eventually popping the dome right out of its frame.I bought this product based on rave reviews from friends who have been using it for many months and in hopes of finding a method to water my cat without all the water ending up on my kitchen floor (he likes to empty all water bowls in the house by batting the water out with his paws). If you have a weird, water-batting cat, this may not work for you. If you have a normal cat, you (and your cat) will love it."
2,Excellent single-disc overview of an old country hitmaker,"Texas-born Billy Walker started recording in the late 1940s, but took several years before he made a dent in the charts. This disc collects his big hits for Columbia Records, including his biggest hit, ""Charlie's Shoes,"" from 1961 and followups such as ""Cross The Brazos At Waco,"" which was a western-themed tune, ala Marty Robbins. Walker was a poppy crooner very much in the Marty Robbins style; fans of rough-edged honkytonk will only find a few tunes here to get their toes a-tapping, although countrypolitan aficianados and Walker's oldtime fans will be cheered to see this classic material back in print again. (The other option is to pick up Bear Family's collosal 6-disc box set, which covers the same years, but this sampling is probably enough to satisfy most folks' curiousity...)"
1,Interesting Subject Poorly Developed,"Reading the back cover, I had high hopes of this novel. However, what could have been a thoughtful, ironic, heartwarming story quickly became plotless and one-dimensional. Do Patty's parents really possess no good qualities whatsoever? Is Anton really the saint he seems? This novel makes no attempt to answer any of these questions, and that's what makes it so painful to read. Patty, who is clearly intended to be the endearing heroine, comes off as a know-it-all with a total disregard for rules and boundaries. Also, doesn't a seemingly romantic relationship between a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old feel questionable at the very least? Add this to the fact that there is absolutely no conclusion, and we have a recipe for one terrible novel. I could go on for ages, but here's the bottom line: do not waste your time with Summer of My German Soldier."
2,Sisters / Hermanas,"This book are a educational and real. This book talk about the younger's dream, because they don't have school or can't go to school because they don't are resident or citizen, and need to work for send money to their family. Some of this people came to U.S.A. because they don't have support on the family,and they don't have money for education, food, rent, dresses they have only one way is work on fiels but some of the supervisors dont't like work with young people, in to much job's are the same problem. The government don't have programs for this people they only work on the prostitution, because on this kind of job want to young people don't matter boy's or girl's.I know some times the mother's work very hard for their kida can study,it's fine but a don't like when the mother are very stronger, because kids can't play, see television or due any other activity, and they grew up very fast."
1,Terrible sound quality.,I use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations. Until now I've been very happy with many different Motorola and Midland models. The FV-700 has great features but the sound quality is soooo bad it's virtually unusable. Don't make the same mistake I did.
1,awful....just pictures of pictures,I have collected old postcards of the White City and several books. This DVD has no new information. It is offensively politically correct. Gene Wilder drones and is terrible. I can't overstate what a waste of money this is. I would give it zero stars as in do not buy.
1,Not a Book for the Masses,"Any one who has worked in a child custody setting or attended the average divorce court will know that STILL FRIENDS Is not a book that addresses the trenchant problems most people face during a divorce. Worse still, one suspects that this book suger-coats some basic facts about the hard work of dismantling a domestic cosmology no matter how educated or therapized the people involved happen to be.. The fact that the book is very small unwittingly validates the impression that the research was slim and the author created a premise and found a few people to support it with biased interviews. It would be great if this author had taken a look at even a handful of literature about family systems therapy: Among other things, she extolls the virtues of infinitely extended families made of spouses and ex-spouses and lovers of ex-spouses and ex-lovers of ex-spouses. This has to be a nightmare for the kids, and one wonders whether any thought has been given to their real feelings."
2,"Not a fan of the genre, but this is very well written","I am not a big fan of the Contemporary Fiction - Dysfunctional Family genre of fiction, a genre that sadly dominates American literature. For me, a contemporary work in this genre needs to be exceptional to even crack a 3 rating.The Corrections is one of those exceptions. The genre is so, so tired, but the Corrections is so masterfully written, both on a level of prose and in the realistic construction of the protagonist family, that I have to give it a 4. This book is very well done."
1,Rodimus Prime - stiff as a board,"I bought Rodimus Prime back in 1987 and I was disappointed. Although he looks OK with flames and bright colours, he is too small compared to G1 Galvatron. How is he supposed to fight a super-powered maniac when he is less than half the size? Furthermore, his articulation is limited to swinging his arms at the shoulders and nodding his head. His trailer is like Optimus's trailer after it's been chopped up and rebuilt smaller. Sure, there are some big guns inside but they don't seem that special. There are some shields on the sides of the trailer guns, which only look strong enough to stop a low-powered medical laser. Rodimus also carries a long rifle, which is like his old Hot Rod guns but stretched. I think that, overall, he is not a worth successor to the Optimus Prime toy or even the brick-like Ultra Magnus toy. I'm very reluctant to buy the reissue, even if it has metal feet!"
2,highly recommend!,"I love most of Ann O'Leary books, very passionate, romantic love stories. This one is certainly one of her best books I've ever read. If you are looking for a real and heart touching love story then this is a must read book!"
2,Every parent should read this to their child!!,"This book is incredible. It is a sweet, enduring, adorably illustrated way to remind your child how much you love him/her. I have read this book to my son for years. We both love it... and he's 9! Great for bedtime, cuddle time... anytime!"
2,"A ""good read"". Interesting plot. Vivid characters.",A very good book from a brand new author. Interesting and different plot line. Vivid characters; especially Max. Look forward to reading more of this author's writing.
2,Great Highlighters with a long life!!,"I am a teacher at an elementary school and I like these Zazzle highlighters very much. I personally consider them THE BEST. The very first set I purchased, I used each color multiply times a day and they have lasted me for 2+ years. I just purchased 2 new sets and there is still a touch of ink in the tubes of the older set. They do not dry out quickly like other name brand highlighters. If you are careful and do not press down hard when you use them, the tips do not break down & the ink comes out minimial and does not run. To use them properly, simply highlight or press ever-so-lightly. Not much effort at all. Of course, in any liquid-filled product, you must replace the cap each time or the tip will dry out, briefly, depending on how long the cap was left off. A good shake or a slight touch of water will bring them bring them back to life. They are great highlighters with a long life!!!"
1,Keep trying.......,"Very handsome star and co-star but storyline did not flow and video was poor quality. Bad ending, would not watch again."
1,useless,"The item will not play on my dvd player . I was NOT informed about the regions until after I received a response from customer care . So now I have an item that is useless , and would cost ME money in order to return it .Very Dissatisfied"
1,ghost in the shell game,"Beautiful animation, absolutely incomprehensible story. I felt like I was watching the Matrix after someone had arbitrarily scrambled all the scenes. It has to do with dolls that kill (for reasons I couldn't figure out), which for some reason had a need for human souls, and are finally tracked down by a detective based on clues that don't seem to be explained in any way."
1,Not worth the glass used to master it,"The fact of the matter is that this is a bootleg and a poorly mastered one at that. Ozit has mastered this all from inferior mp3s sourced from high gen tapes that have been circulating among Beefheart collectors for years.The show itself is a great show and although a lower gen mastering in HD isn't going to necessarily improve the fidelity of this audience recording. I still can't recommend this to anyone but completists who wish to collect every single release.This is definitely not a good place to start if you are looking to check out the music of Captain Beefheart. For that you are better off with something like Spotlight Kid, Clear Spot, Trout Mask Replica or Doc At The Radar Station."
1,A game that is less than the sum of its parts,"This version of Civ is a poor attempt to update those great earlier games, Civ and Civ 2. While GT took a lot of thought about what might be neat to add to the game, they put little thought into how these additions would affect game play and balance. I found the game interface difficult, the new additions unbalancing, and the entire game to be a frustrating experience. I give them an extra star for creativity, but while some parts are nice, this game is a failure on the whole."
2,Arrived quicker than anticipated,"Arrived quickly. Bummer that you don't get the cover art, but they stated that in the description. Definitely worth it."
2,Sony's got a winner,"This is an excellent system. The sound stage on this system is excellent, its quite versatile, you can hook it up to video game systems, dvd players etc. Excellent dolby surround, plus 60 cd space is hard to beat, I love how this system looks the colorful display it's just like a mini jukebox. 225 watts, excellent price....I love it....I give it 5 stars...Sony rocks"
1,not absorbant or leak-proof,"It's soft, but it doesn't absorb and it isn't leak-proof, so you end up with wet clothes and damp skin. I've tried all the disposable brands, and this was the worst."
1,SILVERCHAIR... NOT GOOD CHARLOTTE,"ok, thank god someone brought up the fact that cemetary was writen by daniel johns of silverchair in 1997. NOT GOOD CHARLOTTE. it should be a sin to cover a silverchair song. they're too good. and i think good charlotte sucked at covering it. guh. its insulting to silverchair. what.. do they think just because Billy met Daniel once they have to right to cover one of their songs? sorry if this review pisses anyone off.. but good. watch, good charlotte will turn into a freakin silverchair cover band"
2,Wow,Just returned from El Salvador. This really gave me perspective. Acting was superb and the story line was similar to one I heard while there. Afraid it was all too common
2,Another great CD by jagged Edge,"After J.E Heartbreak i didn't think that they could come out with any other cd's that could match that. Next they came out with jagged little thrill and that was pretty good, not as good as J.E. Heartbreak but it still touched the heart. Now its HARD and what a great cd! I don't think that there is a song that i don't like. It has some slow songs, relationship songs and some up beat songs that you can relate to. My favorite songs are girls gone wild, i don't wanna, like to be in love, in the morning, and walked outa heaven.I think that everyone interested in R&B should have a copy of Jagged Egde: HARD."
2,Fantastic Case,"I was having a hard time looking for am inexpensive case for my ipod nano 2nd gen. I don't like the silicon skins nor the hard cases. I saw this case and decided to go with the brown version. It actually looks surprisingly good with my black nano. The interchangeable fronts (one comes with a belt clip and the other is just flat) work very well. The bottom of the front cover is attached by a metal button (much like on a jacket) that is pretty sturdy and the top is held closed by a magnet. The magnet holds it tight and I do not have any problems with it coming open while clipped to my pocket or messenger bag strap. I run with the nike+iPod kit, so I am constantly pulling the nano out of this case and putting it in an armband. The case has held up to the wear and should last a lot longer.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this case (or a color variant) to anyone who is interested in a nice, cheap case with interchangeable covers."
2,Best Rap CD I've ever heard!!!,"This is by far the best rap album I have ever heard. Dubee's flows are so saucy and smooth, that it is a shame that a fellow like this hadn't blown up. Khayree's production is a great mix of tight, heated beats that are incredibly cool to kick back to. There are also tracks with Mac Dre and Reek Daddy rapping through most of them whic is cool. THere is also a track with Mac Mall, which if you like Mac Mall, is off the hook. This is the best party album in the world if you want to just sit back with some homies or ladies and chill. I have been looking, but still haven't found an album to top this one."
1,19th Century Sex (or Sex and the Shtetl),"What was the point of female liberation and emancipation, when all women want is to define themselves through their (missing) halves? Is the modern girl, really not more than a walking incubator? Why did our mothers and grandmothers, burn their bras? Just to make way for Miracle bras with water inlays? Why did woman want to have the option to fend for herself, when really all she wants is to be dependant? Why are we brainwashed into thinking, that singles are social lepers? If all woman wants, is to sit in the boudoir and weave tapestry, we needn't have bothered with women's rights. Girls go out after work, get drunk, have one night stands, hope it's Mr. Right (or Big, for that matter), and to add insult to injury, feel like they have just auditioned for a part in Sex and the City.If the Four Ladies would have lived at the turn of the Century in Poland, they would have been married by now and would have longed for a career.Arranged Marriage anyone??"
1,Puh-leeze,"I picked up this disjointed piece of dreck at the local library booksale. (If nobody checks out a book for more than two or three years, they don't keep it. Now I know why.) Turns out it was a total waste of my 25 cents. Mr. Thomas ""uncovers"" conspiratorial ""connections"" which would only be plausible to an intellectually-challenged, unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic. See, the Gubbament doesn't want you to know about Stuff, see, and so they like, brainwash people and stuff, see ... it's a fact! Puh-leeze, the X-files was fiction there, bubba. It is illuminating to note that two of the 5-star reviews for this windy and disjointed diatribe are by the author himself, and another touts how utterly engrossing it was for an eight-year-old. Ahem. In short, if you are in need of kindling, I heartily recommend you check out this author's other vanity press works. And K-k-k-ken(n), better kept your curtains closed, 'cause THEY'RE WATCHING!!! Ooooooo, scary!"
1,"OK taste, BUT...","I must say I was excited to find sugarfree gummy bears, but these offer nothing less than a gastric frenzie and hangover to boot. My head pounded for hours after eating these, not to mention the gas. I did read the other reviews, but thought perhaps they consumed too much, or were just sensitive to the sugar substitute. I must say there is no exageration in their claims. The taste is ok (not great - there is an aftertaste), but having one handfull can make the rest of your day miserable. I threw mine out and wished I had bought a smaller bag to try first."
1,"A couple of impressive tracks, but still too weak.","Despite being a Chesky fan, I wasn't really pleased with this sampler. At only 48 minutes (I wonder why Chesky didn't offer a bit more, since they could have easily mastered an extra 30 minutes into the CD), there are few impressive performances in this sampler.The best track is definitely Dave's True Story's ""Dear Miss Lucy"". Excellent album. However, pretty much the rest is somewhat unimpressive.Two other exceptions might be The Coryells (Amazing sound engineering and vocals) and Rebecca Pidgeon's ""Underground"".Ana Caram's bossa nova rythms and perhaps Paquito D'Rivera's tracks might be great to test those high-end headphones or speakers.... that's pretty much all however...Overall, I expected much more from this sampler, both in quantity and quality."
1,Madacy = below 0,"First you're attracted by the price, and then, if you already got the misfortune of acquiring Madacy's product(s), you know it's not even worth that price, since they usually manage to get the worst print they can fish from garbage AND then succeed in making it worse. The fact they're not yet out of business is only the proof for garbage lovers (I've been conned twice, and that's more than enough) being innumerable."
2,Fool A Bug bowls really work!,"I bought this bowl because I have feral cats I feed outdoors and here in Florida, ants are everywhere. I was having to float one bowl inside another, to create a water moat to keep ants out. That method works, but it is very messy. I no longer have to do that because the Fool A Bug does its job and keeps ants out of the food bowl. It is a very sturdy plastic material, so it even withstands raccoons and possums that come out at night looking for leftover cat food. The wildlife knocks the bowl over, but it's okay and no worse for the wear. I am very happy with this bowl and highly recommend it."
1,Poorly made (didn't last a week!),I received these as a Christmas present and they didn't even last a week. They came unsewn at the seams around the toe area on both slippers. It is obvious they are very poorly made. I would defintely not recommend these.
1,Resource conflicts,"I bought the card, plugged it into one of my PCI slots, and installed the software, following the instructions in the manual. I found out, as soon as I tried to run the TV Tuner, that the card had a resource conflict with one of my BIOS extensions. Try after try, I could not get the settings to change. I ended up returning the product, and looking for another TV Tuner card.I'm sure that if I didn't have those resource conflicts, it would have been a great product...documentation was sufficient, the other programs seemed to function great, but because of the serious errors I had, I'm giving this 2 stars."
1,"I'm not made of money, guys.","I've had it with movie studios releasing movies, which everyone runs out to buy because it's the only version of the film available, and then the studio almost immediately releases the better version that everyone wanted in the first place.You double-dipping c*********s. Knock it off."
2,Review,"As I was growing up, these books were the scariest. Since then, I haven't found any that have given me more chills. They are simple, yet terrifying. I recommend these stories to anyone who wants to experience the same chill."
2,Very pleasant,"Good stuff here. The first track is quite famous and rightly so. There are some other standout tracks here and a few that are kind of ho-hum. Nothing's bad, but not everything is classic either."
1,doesn't even deserve one star...,"recently i have been seeing a double commercial put out by Victory records advertising the upcoming atreyu and hh albums. now, a clip of atreyu's video for their new single comes on first, followed by hh's ""saying sorry"". i think that atreyu is one of the least talented bands out now, but hh is so awful, atreyu's song clip seems like a masterpiece compared to the garbage recently released by hh. they are one of the most overhyped bands out there, and for having three guitars and 5+ years of playing experince, they aren't very original or talented. this is not punk rock. and to the reviewer who recommended the sex pistols because they are ""punk in its purest form,"" that is ridiculous. they were talentless posers (like hh) who wished they could've been as relevant and talented as The Clash. sticking needles in the Queen Mother's picture is not punk or rebelious, it's juvenile. For pure punk straight from its roots, check out The Clash and The Ramones."
1,Worst Phone I Have Ever Used,"I have had this phone for over a month now. For some reason, when you press a number button ""0-9"", it does not always register with the phone. The phone beeps, but if you listen into the handset, it never transmits the tone over the phone line. So when a phone number has a ""2"" in it for example, you have to press the ""2"" button one to five times before it will actually register. This also affects memory dial and causes that feature to be completely useless."
1,Candice,"Could be better. The rake is quite loud and doesn't remove much of my husky's undercoat. A combination of a furminator and slicker bush works a lot better for me. Comfortable handle and enjoyable for the dog. Doesn't get stuck like many other rakes due to the rotating teeth, but they are quite loud."
1,Not what I thought,"This reader was not what I thought. Not all the reader is written with characters. The sentences and reader combines romanization and characters as well. I would prefer that the new vocubulary, that it is supossed that you do not know, would be first presented in both, romanization and character, and use only the character in the reader.Another thing that I do not like is the Yale romanization used in the book. I think pinyin romanization would be much better."
2,If you want HEAT buy this heater,Wanted to suppliment our old baseboard heaters in our basement and looked around at brands. Delongi seemed reputible and we had an old oil filled radiator we used that worked well so we tried a couple. Got the retro model and the safe heat one was back ordered. The retro model was fantastic and warmed our large baement real well. Couldnt wait to see how well the other one works. Other one finally came but I didnt mind the wait since it was summer. Well let me tell you - it put another model of radiater from Honeywell that I had found on clearance at Home Depot to shame. The Delongi Safe Heat Dragon warmed our huge family room and the other did not warm a small bed room - maybe I can return the other to Home Depot!If you want HEAT - buy this model - it is great for the size. I was amazed!!Tammy
1,Movies Lie,"Do not be fooled by this product. I bought this along with four terrapins and a rat (since I couldnt lay my hands on a warthog and a rhino). I rubbed this product into my skin and gums then rolled around with the terrapins and the rat.Long story short I did NOT end up with my own crime-fighting mutant superhero team. The rat bit me and I crushed the terrapins. Also I now have a strange rash and Im coughing up blood, whats up with that?Avoid."
1,Stilted narrow-minded view of complex issues,"A simplistic light-weight, boring, stilted. Pseudo-intellectualism at its best. This one is going to wind up in the Dollar Store bin."
1,Not bad,"It works as advertised. I've only charged so I can't confirm if it also syncs. I give the product a 3 but knocked the rating down to a 2 because of Boxwave's service. I ordered 2 sets of the bundle that was supposed to come with with a car adapter, however they only sent me both cables without the adapter. These were separate orders and Boxwave messed up on both my orders. I've already communicated with them and they said they are looking into it. It has almost been 2 weeks and nothings happened. As others have mentioned, the casing on the lightening cable end is a bit larger than the OEM cable so those with a case that has a small opening may have issues."
2,Maiden kick ass!!!,"My boyfriend was a big Maiden fan back in the 80s and that's sort of what hooked me onto them in the first place. Not a bad track on this album at all.... it kicks freaking ass, especially Aces High and The Duellists. Classic Maiden for everyone."
2,"if you are an engineer, Buy It !","Really an amazing collection. Yes, it is technical---but I think the book can satisfy a varied number of people, on a lot of levels. Whether to understand how microphones work, or work better---to know how better to use microphones--or just interested in microphone history, this book is a rare find."
2,The St. Louis question at its finest,"So, Where'd You Go to High School? is a wonderful and thought provoking book. It focuses not only on the historical significance of High Schools in St. Louis, but also gives information on each and every school. I highly recommend this book to anyone from St. Louis or anyone that is interested in high school history and education."
1,There are better... this one is really dated.,"I was tempted into buying this because of a number of positive reviews. I have a few older Austin videos that I enjoy, so don't think that I'm opposed to using those. I'm not. I found myself getting very impatient with Denise, as the warm-up seemed to drag on, and the stretches were very dated. More current videos seem to be so much more effective. The workout itself is longer than many of her tapes, but again, it didn't impress me as being very motivating. I do like her 30 Minute Fat Burning workout(1989), and the Fit and Fat Free(1991) tapes. They're a lighter workout that remind me of the aerobics classes of the late '80s, but are a nice change from the tapes of today."
1,Not Worth It,First I can't believe I paid $30 dollars for a book full of typos. Second I take issue with someone who calls into question the credibility of other so called experts on JFK when apparently you fall into the same category. The author is a self proclaimed archivist and historian. What are your academic credentials? Beware when you read anything by a self appointed expert who can't get his bilge published by a reputable publisher so he has to self publish. If you're thinking of buying this book save your money.
2,Still A Great Retro Shoe,"There's not elaborate or cutting-edge about the Saucony Jazz, it's been around forever, but their simple, unique design makes them a timeless classic. They're incredibly comfortable and while they seem flimsy at first, they actually last a long time. They come in a ton of colors and you really can't beat the price. For the same price as some ""store brands"", you get a sturdy shoe that's been around for decades. Awesome."
2,Fun!,I like this game because it was more edgier (Jak and Daxter was a bit too rated E for me) and I liked the guns. I was excited when I first heard about it and even more excited when I got it for Christmas. Though some missions frustrate me they're all relatively easy (after you die a few times). The downside would probably be because it ended so shortly. But there's plenty of drama and decieving. Gatta love it
2,Reality as it best,Micheal Keaton character in this film shows the truth when someone is in denial of their problems and are afraid to face the truth. The film does show how this country has to realize that our country has a serious problem with drugs and alcohol and we need more rehab places.
2,So cool.,"These corn holders are awesome. There are four pair of holders in the set. The coolest feature is that they interlock with one another for easy storage. So, no more lonely single corn huggers rolling around and getting lost in your kitchen drawers! They are a dark green color and of the perfect size for getting a good grip on your corn on the cob. No burned fingers with these things! Highly recommended. :)"
2,wow!,I thought my old vacuum did a great job--I just couldn't stand replacing the messy bag. I used this vacuum for my weekly cleaning. The canister needed emptying before I even reached the bedrooms. It was easy to put together and easy to empty. I am very pleased.
2,Wonderful for diabetic neuropathy,"My mother's hands are always cold and achy from diabetic neuropathy, and these gloves make her much more comfortable. Not only does the neoprene lining keep her hands warmer, the mild compression relieves some of the nerve pain.She gets lots of compliments on her fashionable gloves. The hand specialist who was fascinated to learn about the gloves. He'd never seen anything like them before.She's been wearing them almost daily for almost three years and one seam is beginning to split, so I'm ordering another pair. Glad Amazon still stocks them.By the way, I tried the equivalent product for feet and discovered that they don't come in pairs. Ridiculous! Thermoskin should be ashamed."
1,Incomplete Information,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have done hours of research on all types of Bariatric surgery and this book is one of the least informative. Gastric Bypass is hown as the magic answer. Easy, simple, and the only way. In reality this is far from the truth. Gastric Bypass is a huge decision for a person to make, and one that should not be made unless the patient is adequately informed.Specifically the sections covering other surgical options (duodenal switch, gastric banding, etc.) are blatantly biased. While I realize this book is geared toward Gastric Bypass, that is no excuse to give false or incomplete information on other surgeries. Also, the sections on Gastric Bypass itself is very glossed over and makes it seem as though it will be a cure as opposed to a tool for weight loss.There are so many other informative books out there...this just isn't one of them."
1,Doesn't arrive in one piece,I order this shovel and had to ask for a replacement twice. Each time the shovel arrived with a broken handle. I gave up and ask for a refund. Can't say how good it works because I never got a chance to use it.
2,Anne Rivers Siddons books,I love most of Anne Rivers Siddons books and have read every one she has written. She is a great read.
1,Very Unsatisfied,Was not impressed with the pan at all-it is not a 12 inch but only 11 1/4 - the quality isn't worth the money-sent mine back and order the mill.farberware 12 inch that I had before.
2,Wonderful classic movie,"This is a classic. If you like comedy with a little bit of mystery, this is the movie for you."
2,Great Teen Read,"I absolutely loves this book and couldn't put it down!! I loved the way Colasanti did the alternating view points so that you can read it not only from Saras viewpoint, but Tobey's also. I was rooting for Tobey the whole way!!!!"
2,best star wars toy i got so far!!!!,"this figure is awesome. he comes with a removable hand, lightsaber, weather vane, blaster pistol, and a Bacta tourniquet. this figure is so fun to play with. he can really hang on the weather vane with his legs. you use that for display or something. i recommend this toy to any star wars fan. very rare so if you see it, buy it. you wont regret it."
2,Powerful,"It's often said that in today's society we have no heroes. If you read this book, you will soon learn otherwise."
1,"This generations ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" ( Yes, it's that bad.)","What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Out Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performances that this film really did not deserved. Other than Weisz and Stormare, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
2,Helpful Information,I bought this so that when I hire people to do work in my home I am able to identify by their tattoos whether they have been in prison or been involved in gangs. You have to be careful who you let around your family and in your home. This book has very useful information and pictures to help you avoid a potentially bad situation.
2,Best Buy,"This is a very good Booster seat for growing kids. I agree that the cup holders are lousy but NO big deal ! For so much comfort, you can forsake cupholders - cant' you ? Great padding, sturdy and easy to install. My son loves it and so do I. Fits-in and looks great in any size car - sedan or suv. I would definitly recommend this seat."
2,Powerful book about a quaint town,To know Rockaway is to absolutely know what it's like to not be able to live without Rockaway. Kevin Boyle captures Rockaway's darkest moments and shows how a community bonds together and rebuilds. He shows our strength and our unity during these tragic times. Thanks Kevin.
2,Peace prevails,"Thumbing through the reviews here is interesting, as we see comparisons between Sonic Nurse and Goo, Dirty, Daydream Nation, Evol, Murray Street, NYC Ghosts & Flowers, the early work from the 1980's ... pretty much the band's entire oeuvre. And I agree, it bears favorable comparison with all of the above and more.Whether this is SY's ""best album ever"" is another matter, and ultimately a trivial one. This record should attract more listeners and inspire interest in their previous work, and surely that's praise enough.What stands out is how the band has truly collaborated here in a way they have not always done. It's hard to hear the lines between the ""Kim songs,"" the ""Thurston songs,"" the ""Lee songs."" This is more blended, more -- dare I say the word -- mature effort.Yes, it's a little bit languid in parts, but how long can we reasonably expect the band to keep rocking out like they're 20?This is a great album for SY fans, and a good starting point for newcomers."
1,Total Garbage,"I bought this exact model in 2002 for boot camp. i thought i should get the best quality watch for something like that and since it is the navy seal watch i figured it would be pretty good. for daily use it looks cool and lights up insanely bright at night. you would have no trouble telling the time in the dark. now the bad part... on the way to boot camp, the light strip on the second hand fell off! it just rattled around inside. then i got to boot camp and i cracked the face without even abusing the freaking thing. it made me sick knowing how much this stupid watch cost me. i ended up having to go to the store so i could buy a [...] timex ironman watch. i used it through boot camp and still wear it today after 7 years of abuse. i had to change the battery for the first time about a month ago. i say dont waste your money. this watch isnt all that luminox claims it to be. its absolute crap."
2,Indescribable!!!,"My cousin gave me the first two books in this series. For some reason i read Charlotte first. It was so great, i couldn't imagine how Katherine could be better. But it turns out i couldn't put Katherine down. It's got to be the best book i've ever read! So if you enjoy history, romance, and adventure, then Katherine is THE book to read! So what are you waiting for? Pick up the book and READ IT!!! Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"
2,Good 15 Gauge Finish Nailer,I purchased this with a Bostitch 6 gallon compressor and 18 gauge brad nailer to do some trim work around the house. Things to note are the gun did not come with a quick connect coupling and be sure to get the 25 degree angled nails. Most other brands use the 30+ degree nails.The gun works pretty good. Jams once in a while i.e on the last nail in the feeder. Easy to clear them. At 100 PSI I've had no trouble driving in 2 1/2 nails. A lot easier than hand nailing!
2,The loudest case fan ever,"Too loud. It can be heard at the other end of the house. It should come with a speed control, it doesn't. It's the best case fan in the world if you need one this powerful."
2,Best purchase ever.,"This is the by far the best $50 I have ever spent. I know it seems kind of pricey but compared to most others it's a bargain in price and quality. I work 3rd shift and my house is right on a busy road and it's difficult to fall asleep in the mornings when traffic is picking up. Also, my husband has a 5 year old kid with a whiney,high pitched, screechy voice who wakes up at the buttcrack of dawn and visits every other weekend. Once she is up and peeling paint off the walls with that voice I can't fall asleep to save my life and this machine drowns her out wonderfully. It's like having a fan running without the wind which is a nice bonus in the New England winter. I absolutely love it."
1,avoid,"This is not a DK album...this is an album put together by 3 money hungry hypocritical pigs who wanted to cash in on DK's name. Jello Biafra wants nothing at all to do with this , he tried to prevent it from being released , and you as a true Jello fan should protest and not buy this ,if you buy this you might as well go and burn your old DK albums because you obviously never cared for what they stood for anyway , or really what Jello stood for because the money hungry ex members screwed him over . They're also trying to get credit for songs they didn't even write , and steal more money from Jello they didnt , and never will deserve. Don't buy this , ...ha if you can burn as many copies of this as you can of this garbage...stick with the old DK albums and Jello's spoken word albums or any bootleg material..not this sellout corporate garbage"
1,chair leg pads,"These are much smaller than I thought they would be and are not useful for the situation intended. The stick-on felt pads don't work at all on chair legs so I needed an item like this with the felt factory attached. If they had a larger version of these, I'd buy it today."
2,Works Great,I've used it all summer and have a 5 gallon jug on it. Easy to set up and I've not had any problems with leaks.Highly recommend.
2,Stargate SG1 season 7,I had only 2 more seasons to collect to complete my Stargate SG1 series. I am so happy I was able to find this on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Thank you!
2,The best violin player in the world.,The legendary violin player shows here deep feelings through standards. It takes you to New York...like you were there....
1,Canon USB Cable,"This cable does not ""fit"" into my Canon camera. It would seem that it is designed for a different type of output. On close inspection there is a slight difference in the plug that inserts into the camera! It is totally worthless."
2,A great discussion starter,This series is a wonderful way to engage folks in discussions about how faith in God affects every day life and how it is reflected in thoughtful ways in somewhat contemporary literature.
2,Very conducive to a good night sleep,"The sheets are quite comfortable, very soft and light enough to allow for a restful summer slumber."
2,Blends easily.,"Though a little thick even in skim milk. comparable to optimum brand whey. Protaquest is slightly better... The best tasting protein powder I have ever used is prosource vectron. all based on personal opinion, best to do your own Trial&error."
2,Korea at a Glnce,Excellent reference document. Recently updated. It really gives you a sense of security if you need it. I can't believe it was only $9.00.
1,easily escapable,"My beagle has improved a lot with leash training but still pulls like mad when on the scent. This harness worked well, discouraging most minor pulling. I was pleased - until she caught scent of a rabbit and escaped in two seconds. Also, the straps loosened while walking. For safety we will be using a combo harness/martingale collar and two leashes.Update: Nope, even with the inescapable collar this harness is just no good. Even mild pulling/jumping when she is excited and trying to get at a squirrel etc. results in the harness coming right off. I won't be using this any longer."
2,Great digital recorder,"This is an easy to use, lightweight digital recorder that you can fit into your shirt pocket. The screen is fairly large and easy to see and it works like any other digital recorder so it's easy to use. The USB connection that slides out of the recorder is a plus and makes it easy to transfer the recordings onto your computer. Great buy!"
2,Excellent craftsmanship!!,These earrings are a piece of artwork. The craftsmanship is great. The only issue I have with these earrings is the size / weight. They are quite heavy and you have to put the backs on very tightly if you want them to hang nicely. They come nicely packaged and NOVICA does an excellent job of communicating the status of the order.
1,It is just cheep. Sci-fi is designed to deliver an idea.,"The original title is ""Terrarium"" (filmed in Las Vegas and surrounding area) watch and you will see why. For impatient a fast forward now and then can not hurt. If you have a Blu-ray player the first level of fast forward will still play the sound and the cheesy background music. If it was not too armature this would be sci-fi. It is worth a quick review.Basic premise a hand full of unlikely astronauts ""misfits"" in various ways are cryogened. Their ship gets damaged and they end up on a mysterious planet. Naturedly the computer is toast so the glass cryogenic cubes will not open. Then they find that they are not alone and that the glass doors will open with enough force from the outside to offer a hairy alien tasty treats. Wait there is more to come."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR: MUTILATED VERSION!!,"The good news here is that the sound and image restorations are very good. The bad news, it was a worthless effort. This specific DVD comes in at 47 minutes, 15 minutes short of the film's actual 62 minute run time. Avoid this turkey like a cursed jewel."
1,Overrated,"Tamora Pierce's popularity is the unfortunate result of the whole Harry Potter phenomenon. Simply because Pierce is a fantasy children's writer, bookstores have been pushing her books. ""If you like Rowling, you'll love Pierce"" is the slogan. I'm a big fan of fantasy books for children, and I eagerly read this book. It completely bored me (plus, what's up with the sex?). The protagonist is annoying and uninteresting. My mind felt like it was rotting as I was reading Pierce's simplistic books. If you want some good children's fantasy books (or good books in general), read Diana Wynne Jones. She's way better than Rowling, and it's complete blasphemy to speak of Pierce in the same breath as DWJ. DWJ has wit, depth, and originality. I would take her books with me on a deserted island since I'm always discovering new things about her stories every time I re-read them. Start off with _Howl's Moving Castle_ (now there's an interesting female protagonist!) and go on from there."
2,"Good performing all-in-one, perfect for the home office","This is a attractive, compact all-in-one with almost flawless performance. Like other reviewers, I also had software installation issues, and it took a *long* call to HP tech support to get the device installed and working properly. Since then, I've faxed, printed, and scanned nearly every day, with no complaints. Print quality is excellent, but ink is expensive and short-lived. Scan auto-feeder is great, but quality is only good enough for duplication and documentation (Not good enough for photos). Faxing and copying is perfect. The one-button scan, especially to Adobe Acrobat, is excellent. If I were buying now (Jan 2007), I would look for a similar unit with an Ethernet connection instead of USB, the HP 6310."
1,Contains natural rubber,"It is a well constructed, quality product. Unfortunately, it is made with natural latex rubber, which can be a serious problem for those of us with latex allergies. If you have ever experienced hand itching and / or pain after wearing rubber gloves, or have food allergies, or any other sensitivities, DO NOT USE this, or a similar, product. The more you do, the worse the problem will get, until it eventually becomes life threatening."
2,honest,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYThe author tries to explain the reasons for Clapton's actions off and on stage, some of which harmed him, others of which harmed others."
1,Plastic Parts Break Easily,"The jig broke the first time I adjusted the hinge size. The small plastic teeth which hold the gauge in the slot broke clean off one minute after I took the jig out of the package. Twenty seconds later it was in the garbage. Buy something made of metal. It looked like a 50 cent tool, and performed like it."
2,THE BEST HARMONICA INSTRUCTION A BEGENNER CAN GET!,"This is truly the most comprehensible, hassle-free self-teaching guide for raw beginners. Go with this book and you cant go wrong. Just play along with CD and you will have so much fun! After you finish with this one you may want to purchase Jon Dick's Rock and Blues Harmonica for slightly more advanced techniques you may also want to check out Tom Ball's Source Book series which is a very convenient reference of famous Blues harp licks/riffs."
1,Awful,"Despite this being the first new monster film in a while, I found it flat an uninspiring. I could barely stop myself from skipping through the chapters. Save your money."
2,Very interesting,"I waited for the dvd to come out to watch this Batman movie. I had surgery when it came out and then I waited too because I like to use the captions since, with my hearing impairment, it's easier for me to understand the masked characters with subtitles. I enjoyed the movie and am glad we added it to our collection."
2,Swing This Town,"This is the best record of The Brian Setzer Orchestra! Jump Blues and Swing of course. Great! Cover ""Jump, Jive, An' Wail"" of Louis Prima is great, ""You're the Boss"" of Elvis/Ann Margret (Viva Las Vegas movie) is better than original (Gwen Stefani sings great), ""As Long as I'm Singing"" is an old Bobby Darin song, ""This Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""The Dirty Boogie"", ""Let's Live It Up"" and ""Hollywood Nocturne"" and ""Switchblade 327"" are his originals, while ""Sleepwalk"" (orig. Santo & Johnny), ""Rock This Town"" (orig. Stray Cats), ""Since I Don't Have You"" (orig. The Skyliners), ""Nosey Joe"" (orig. Bull Moose Jackson) are very good covers too.Some excellent musicians are featured here (Tony Garnier - stand-up bass, Mark Winchester (ex. Planet Rockers) - stand-up bass and Eddie Nichols (Royal Crown Revue)-backing vocals). Brian Setzer is winning again!"
2,Handy addition to yard work,Has worked very well around the yard. It could be a little wider at the handle for my large frame.
1,"Disappointing, not distracting","While I've enjoyed Ms. Lauren's works in the past and was looking forward to another installment in the Bastion Culb series, this book was a definite disappointment. The hero was interchageable with the heroes in her previous books and the heroine, despite her unusual occupation, was weak. The book would have been helped by some judicous editing as the story seemd to drag throughout, picking up only in the last few chapters. As always, the romantic scenes between the characters were sensual and well written but, again, they were pretty much the same as the scenes and the progression in her previous books.Although I enjoy rereading the books of my favorite authors, this one definitely won't be read again and only my curiosity about the identify of Dalziel is likely to cause me to read another in this series."
2,it's really really helpful,"Most of us engineering students started physics in high school, which is algebra based. Then we go onto college and the physics classes there use calculus. Now unless you are a math and physics super student, then you should probably buy this book. To me, it seems to just give enough calculus. Some other books - the one used in my school for example, gives too much calculus and confuse the heck out of me. But this book puts concepts as the number one priority, and caculus as the secondary priority. Once the concepts are conveyed to the reader, the calculus seems to fit onto the concepts kind of naturally almost. I like that approach, plus the fact that the author can really explain things really well makes this a great book for all students struggling in college level calculus based physics classes."
1,Confused Ending,"The ending was so bad I felt insulted. The first 80% of the book was a 3-star. I am a chronic reader, so I read a 3-star without complaining. When the surprised ending was revealed, it was like walking into a brick wall. The surprise was bad, but the chapters after the surprise were worse."
2,Used McCall's Cook Book,We have used the same cookbook for over 30 years and it was falling apart. I was so glad to have found the identical cookbook to replace our old one. We are very happy with the condition and look forward to using it for years and years.
1,Bored to Tears,"The only people who should read this book are the stuffy academics the main character belittles, as this reads more like a lecture than a piece of interesting prose. There is little sense of suspense or danger in his fight scenes. Donohues' martial technique descriptions don't live up to his reputation as someone well-versed in a variety of Asian martial arts. Save for his relationships to master and his brother, there is very little in the way of interesting character interactions, and the conclusion is anti-climactic at best. Even the detective aspect to the story barely held my attention. If you're someone looking for a story rich with martial arts content this book will disappoint you."
2,AMAZING,"THIS IS THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION! I would suggest anyone to watch it, as I am hooked and even though I have seen every episode on TV I still find myself buying the seasons so that I own them"
1,Beware - Soup explodes in microwave,"Not a good soup for the microwave. Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues. I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel. Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave."
2,Great,I am very please with the purchase of the Baltimore Ravens Team Pole Flag. The flag is very well made and is a great addition to our yard!
1,the ear,"I bought this excited to put my entire music catalog in a small portable package for car and boat. What's the beef? Well for one, it's not compatible with Windows Media Player 11 which would not recognize it. As a result, it's own software,Gigabite Room, was the only option and Gigabite Room was terrible and full of glitches even after having Toshiba mail me an update disc. Now, after a few months, my Gigabeat 40 doesn't even function and I've thrown it away. No, I'm not electronic devise or computer challenged. No I didn't drop it. Buy at your own risk."
2,my favorite,"This book is what the world of photography needs. I go to [local bookstore] and all I see is models, landscape, and the usual [stuff] that everyone thinks photography should be. Deborah is trying to put these words into the pictures. The text is from russian poets/philosophers with a sort of bleak view of the world. If you want to read don't get a photography book. I think she did what she wanted as far as the pictures go. The faces show life the buildings show age. She made the book look the age of the world the poets were writing about. This book couldn't be any more perfect and if you can't appreciate that then please sell your copy to someone who can."
2,happy grandma,I started the growing in grace collection for my first grandaughter when she was born and add to it each year on her birthday. I get the blonde series since she is blonde. Each piece is so unique. Love the collection.
2,GREAT DEAL!!!,"The Samsung television that I purchased has a great picture quality, sound, and just an overall great quality that you would expect of a flat panel television. I HIGHLY recommend this or any Samsung flat panel HDTV.PS...My XBOX360 looks sexy as ever now!!! I could never go back to a non-HDTV after this experience."
2,The good outnumbers the bad,"Pros:- Reasonable alarm sound (for light-medium sleepers)- Compact and extremely portable- Lightweight yet sturdy; size that fits the falm of your hands, yet has a foldable stand- Good led light, clear indications of the size of each button- Affordable and matching with many types of furniture, color, etcCons:- Not user friendly- Adjusting time, alarm, difficult due to the one direction limit digits go only higher till 59 and resets to 0 )"
2,D-Mannose Powder,My daughter told me about this powder and I researched it online before purchasing. I was impressed and it works wonders. I add it to unsweetened orange juice 2 - 3 times a day and again at bedtime. Knocked an impending urinary infection right away. No more pain in such a short amount of time. I will use this as a daily routine @ 1 - 2 tsp per day from now on.
1,ARCTIC SILVER,THE PHOTO OF THE PRODUCT WAS THE SAME AS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MAYBE 20 YEARS.WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS TINY. THERE WAS HARDLY ENOUGH GOO FOR ONE CPU.VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PRESENTATION ON AMAZON. NO WARNING I WAS ORDERINGA SUBSTANDARD QUANTITY.
2,So much for the money!,"I loved this DVD, and wish Reader's Digest would make many more like it. The photography and narration are excellent, and the DVD highlights so many different and fascinating locations. It has three very long segments, so you get your money's worth. (I keep it on the TV in my kitchen and watch it over and over as I cook, and I catch my kids watching it as well.)"
1,Simply awful,"The characters were narrow, the plot was predictable and the rhetoric questions put to the reader extremely annoying."
2,Rocking Rocky III,"The soundtrack to the second sequel to 1976's ROCKY spawned the #1 hit for Survivor,EYE OF THE TIGER. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic later used the music for his recording of THEME FROM ROCKY XIII(obviously fictitious). That was one of his food songs simply put as ""the rye or the keiser"". Yankovic's song tells about a deli owner who of course,prepares sandwiches. Shortly after the release of this album,Survivor released an album re-using EOTT. There are two new versions of TAKE YOU BACK recorded by Sylvester's brother Frank Stallone. There's a new version of GONNA FLY NOW,also. And of course,DeEtta Little and Nelson Pigford contribute to this album like they did the two predecessors. The other songs are great."
1,Clear and Step-by-Step THIS.,"This was the textbook chosen by my educational institute to introduce us to PowerBuilder and Object-Oriented Fundamentals. I'd have to say it fails on each of those counts.You're not introduced to PowerScript until nearly halfway through the book, the code is NOT laid out in a step-by-step fashion AT ALL after the first chapter or so (and even then), there are coding errors all over the place, and the finished product that you can download has all sorts of inconsistencies with what's in the book (it's as though they kept the application the same from PowerBuilder 5 and never bothered to check the new text against it or something).I'm in the process right now of trying to reverse engineer the example from Que's website and compare my own to figure out what snippets the book has omitted that are preventing my application from functioning properly. Thank you, William Heys, for depriving me of some much-needed sleep. :P~"
2,"Please beat me up, I'd really appreciate it sweety.","Burst Angel is really cool. It's about a couple of mega cool chicks that do contract ass kicking work for a syndicate. Jo and Meg are the main characters. They have been friends for quite a while. Jo doesn't remember her past, but for some reason she knows kung fu. They live in an armored mobile home type thing with their boss and a young girl who is a computer nerd making a living doing the syndicates dirty work.The animation in this series is good, and so is the voice acting and soundtrack. There's plenty of action and fan service. If I had to choose the people I would most like to get beat up by it would be Jo and Meg. I really like Burst Angel and I hope you do too."
1,Barftastic!,This is the grossest thing ever next to chitlans and liver.(no offense to you liver and chitlan lovers). It taste like preservatives with a little bit of fake cheese. Ick yuck and ewe!
2,amazon makes mistakes,"Amazon['s]...""reviewer"" is partially correct. .You have not indicated that this is a VINTAGE recording made available again on CD, recorded in England. Nothing to do with Ohio. It isn't a D'Oyly Carte Orchestra either, though. At any rate, there are very good and probably better transfers of this and like recordings available from Chris Webster and Jim Lockwood. Do a search online for Chris and Jim and also for Savoynet if you are a G&S enthusiast."
2,Stylish,"I love this so much it makes my bathroom look nice, its very sturdy so it never falls, Im actually thinking about buying another for my boys bathroom."
2,Love this Show,I always loved The Pretender and Micheal T Weiss. I was not disappointed in buying the DVD series and rewatching them. If you loved this show when it was on the air you will love it on DVD.
2,"Informative, Well Wrtiien and Documented","If you are a genealogist and have ancestors in North Carolina in the mid 1700's, you have to own this book! This is more about the inhabitants that settled the region and not a dry history of the area.I found wonderful information on both my paternal and maternal lines. I had no idea that both sides of my family were living next to each other and attending the same church.This is a must have for anyone doing genealogy in early North Carolina."
1,Deep Dish,"If you like ""show tunes"" and like 'dressing up' for your special someone, you will love Chicago.Ladies--if you have run out of ways to torture your husband, take him to this grueller of a chick flick--This will get even with him for that last ""golf outing"" he went on and came home with lipstick on his pants.This one makes 'Cats' look like a Schwarzeneger movie....Fred"
2,fun times,"This toy is so fun for the kids, they get a kick out of riding it, it supports even the big kids."
2,great as a sing-along beginner book,"I'm a beginner with a good ear for music. So I hear the differences between this book and the album. That being said, I love this book--it breaks down Beatles' songs into just a few easy chords--perfect for a sing-along.If you want to sound like an album or are a really experienced guitar player, there may be better books."
2,finite element analysis,"this book is for those who have already acquire a working commercial version of finite element analysis program. it explains the mathematical formula instead of giving u the computer algorithm. it's almost impossible to write your own software so this book is enough to explain the concept of finite element. for example, it teaches u to spread a point load over several nodes because of a singularity problem, things that u have to know using the finite element software. for those who don't have a commerical version of finite element program, this book recommend visualfea which u can download from intuition.com. or u can buy it online from wiley.com at $35 usd. it furthur leads u to abaqus cae which is even a better finite element which is very expensive. for those who can't afford it, a student version of abaqus is available for free."
1,Not that captivating,"Memoir is a hard genre to write, and this one does not capture my interest as a reader. Perhaps the writer did not have enough distance from the events, or the writer just couldn't say the hard things that needed to be said because of a fear of hurting family members still alive? The memoir just falls flat."
2,"Readable, Clear, and full of Chutzpah","Dershowitz's succinct analysis and flowing prose make for a powerful read. The author recounts his Brooklyn youth, law school, and his career at Harvard University. He also examines anti-Semitism, separation of church-and-state, assimilation, and other facets pertaining to Jewish and non-Jewish life in America. Dershowitz emphasizes that American Jews must stop maintaining low profiles or feeling anxious about our success (and non-success), as doing so is the essence of second-class citizenship. His point is well taken, but perhaps newly arrived immigrants from Russia and other anti-Semitic lands will doubt his premise. I didn't always agree with the man's pro-Israeli views, but on balance this is a very thoughtful and informative book."
1,I didn't like it either...it should be 0 stars,"The game play is fine other than the glitches other reviewers have noted. However, I refuse to use any software that requires an internet connection in order to be used. What if that internet phone line is my personal phone line also? Then every time I play the game that line is tied up and none of the other family members have access to a phone. What a needless hassle.The game instructions refer to a ""offline mode"" but it doesn't seem to work. They even have a customer help website that has a ""How to make the offline mode work"" thread, (which indicates there is a problem)but it seems to be written for some other game because the instructions didn't work for my game.My conclusion: Save your money. If they spent millions of dollars developing this game then someone somewhere was grossly overpaid! I paid $50 for my game but it's now in the county dump. Skip this one."
1,Dissapointing,"I recieved this book as a gift and was SO EXCITED.I wished to learn more about old saddles, dates, maufacturing, types, etc.I was really dissapointed when I sat down to read it.It was very vauge...not at all what I was expecting.And NOT WORTH (the money) (to me)."
1,Old Repeater Only 3 song Total Ripoff!!!,"My friend James recommened that I get the soundtrack that there were at least 9 great songs. Well maybe there were in the movie, but they certainly were not on this CD. I wasted my money.Only 3 songs Rocky theme, Eye Tiger, and Livin in America. Total ripoff!!"
1,Not Loud Enough,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. Definitly NOT loud enough, I tried them with my Ipod and my Garmin - neither was loud enough. I had to go with in ear phones."
1,Worst Ever,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! I don't know who these people are that are soo satified but I think they are planted reviews. This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
1,Stole sweetness,"Gently grating vocals paired with muted melodies and tourist techno, exploiting a sort of generic emo-prog, keep tame connections at bay."
1,A Warrant To Kill,The perpetrator and victim's back ground were detail well by Casey. The story falls short on details of the interaction between the two. I was left wanting. The book read as if it was two novels that converge at the last possible moment. I was unable to connect with the character on any emotional level.
2,Kitchen helpers,"In my family we work full time jobs and commute everyday 1.5 hours in each direction, and we still cook dinner every night. With these little guys I can prep all of the spices and small chopped items on the counter and as we cook we can dump them right in without much fuss. To me these are great to keep small items together while cooking and keeping the cutting board clear of items. These clean up great in the dishwasher and do not have any smells or residue after cleaning, even after ginger and garlic."
2,An exciting read! Keeps you guessing until the very end.,"Sleeping beauty may be the best mystery I have read yet this year. It is a truly twisted tale that will have you wanting to stay up all night to read.I felt the book was well written, gaving just enough clues to not spoil the ending too early or leave you wondering how did the crimes get solved. This is my first book by this author, and I am hooked, I will read some of his earlier works. Sleeping Beauty was impressive."
2,A must for fans of the Visions of Greece TV program,"Not all the tracks are ""home runs"" but 5 of the tracks were used in the Visions of Greece program shown on HDNET and PBS. Those tracks are truly impressive and even more so when accompanied by the excellent scenery from the TV program."
1,Don't play this on your PC!,"Sony's copy protection scheme installs harmful rootkit software on Windows machines. This software can crash your machine, and make it easier for viruses to infect you. It also causes a small but constant drain on your processing power - even when you're not listening to music. By design, it is impossible to uninstall without advanced technical skills.Sony recently released a patch to mitigate these concerns. However, the patch only addresses the issue of potential virus infection. Uninstalling the software is still nearly impossible, and if attempted incorrectly can render your CD drive unusable.For more information, search for ""sony rootkit"" on the sysinternals web site."
2,This is very good stuff,"I have very oily skin , I use this in the morning and very smooth, make my face feels like silk and no grassy , and absorb very good, I will buy this again."
1,It didn't work with the game I had bought it for.,It did not work with the game I had bought it for. May have been my mistake in purchasing it.
2,Excellent ending,"Pretty much the same review I gave for the first DVD, with the exception that it ended pretty well. Lots of action. Really BIG battles over vast spaces."
2,Strong xmas film,"If you enjoy films with Reese Witherspoon, then you should buy this and watch it ASAP. She shines in this movie. Well done!"
1,Throw up! Throw up!!,"I may have missed the boat here-nobody has cared enough about this to write a review in months. Maybe ol'Petey is just another one hit hip hop flava' of the month. Yet,this cd has everything a hip hop cd needs to be a big seller:boring music and lyrics,all the depth of an ashtray and the personality to match. I heard this at a party. It's the best place to hear it actually-you're too intoxicated to care how bad it really is,the noise of conversation helps drown it out and Raise up makes tha hootchies take off they shirts.This is only for those who have given up or are too young to know better.Everyone else,continue to avoid it."
1,Extremely Irritating Voice,"While the sound of the waves was quite nice, the speaker had the most annoying voice and would draw out words in the strangest places. Instead of saying ""relaaaax"" and holding the a, he'd say ""relaxxxxxx"" and keep repeating the x. That sound only made me tense up and start talking back to the tape.I didn't care for the music either. It was too synthesized sounding for proper relaxation.Unfortunately, I really hated this tape."
2,"works REALLY well, but is too small","works REALLY well, but is too smallwas suggested by a friend that you can use it for larger amounts of food by removing the rubber base and chopping away on a cutting board, moving from one pile of whatever to another. this works, so the only problem is cleaning more than just the chopper."
2,Perfect for home users,"Eva Barash's intermediate yoga workout LIVINGROOM YOGA offers up 48 minutes of strengthening fitness routines which use systematic bodily exercises and include special movement and breathing techniques. It's easy to turn a living room into a private exercise room with this yoga instructional, perfect for home users."
2,Great for a rabbit,"I have a larger angora rabbit that now uses this as a nice big indoor pen. I wish it had a bottom, so for now I opted for the UV cover and just put it on the bottom, seems to be working fine. She's not interested in chewing on it yet, and she doesn't seem to be scratching it up much (though it's a little slippery for play). It's really easy to fold up so I'm planning on getting another one so I can take her to places and set her up or give her more room for play at home. Lucky rabbit :)"
2,One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !,"Truly the best album I've ever listen to. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. I love Shirley's voice, its sultry and seductive, and she really rocks. All the tracks are great! Go out and buy it! Its definitely worth it."
1,Was this book even editted?,"This is yet another example of someone publishing ""true"" facts, before checking on their authenticity. Sometimes I wonder if editors even exist anymore for a number of newspapers and books, given the number of false stories touted as true. Regarding this particular book, you can check out its stories at www.snopes.com, which prints the research and checkable sources for each of their ""is it true or not"" determinations re urban legends such as those contained in this book. (E.g., the one in the book re someone who strapped a super-powerful engine to the top of their car, ignited it, and crashed into a cliff; FALSE, and confirmable as false EASILY by checking the sources listed by snopes.)Save your money and don't buy this book, unless you just want to amuse yourself with some made up stories. (Some people seem to LOVE that, given that they forward e-mails of stories such as those in this book, without bothering to do even the easiest research to see if the story is true.)"
1,No good!,I thought this was a good idea. A friend of mine has a talking caller id and it would eliminate getting up everytime the phone rings. We tried our announcer on several of the phones in our house and it did not work at all! I am very disappointed.
1,"Deep down, you know this is the wrong vacuum cleaner","I haven't had this vacuum for even 6 months, and it no longer works. The ""self-cleaning"" HEPA filter doesn't, and when it becomes packed with dirt and dust, the entire vacuum loses suction. Then when you go to empty the clear canister, blobs of dirt fall onto the floor and the base of the vacuum.I paid around $280 for this vacuum because I have allergies, and a dog, and this was supposed to be top of the line. This is a top of the line disgrace to the Hoover Company."
2,The most used power tool I own,"I have several corded and cordless tools but this one is by far the most used tool in my DIY arsenal. This tool has enough power to drive 1.5 inch drywall screws and is light enough you can use it all day with out fatigue. The quick release action makes it easy to switch between various sizes of cross, flat, square and specialty bits.This tool is just the right speed to do electrical work but not fast enough for some construction work. But I don't need it to be. I have my full size drills for that.This tool is well built. I have dropped or knocked over mine several times with no damage. It even feels better in my hand than some of the less expensive cordless screwdrivers my friends have."
1,BORRRIIIIING!,"I read this book in 8th grade. It was fairly easy to read and was not too hard, but it was by far the most boring and pointless piece of literature that I have ever read in my 15 years of life. I MUCH would have rather read a Case Note!If you are considering purchasing this book, I thouroughly discourage it. If you MUST read something by George Orwell, read Animal Farm. It is a pretty good book..."
1,radio friendly,"It is exactly the words radio friendly in amazon's little review that make me flinch. KS have turned into a pop band and they play songs that are nice, but just a little heavier than your average boyband. Too much Kinks, too much other (better) Britpop bands and even Spinal Tap.Over the top, just not very good."
2,"Not bad, not bad at all.","Exactly what I ordered. Plain and simple, in perfect condition. Definitely a great deal, I think it's safe to say I got more than my money's worth."
2,just owning is probably not enough....,"Gridlock, in itself, defies classification therefore no matter what type of music you claim to listen to in the shower or on your commute, Gridlock will suit the occasion. If you foolishly put off buying the first album do not hesitate on this one. The tracks to be found on this second masterpiece are constructed so that you cannot tell if you are on a cliff and about to fall off or on a plain with the wind in your face. See Gridlock live and you will know the feeling first hand. If this is not humanly possibly then take a day off of work and devote an entire afternoon listening to nothing but Gridlock and I guarantee you will see why music is as important as breathing."
2,merax Digi Deck Plusdeck2 C tape to mp3 recorder,"The merax Digi Deck Plusdeck2 C is a very good. It performs as expected. After a while though it stopped finishing converting the wave file to mp3.But, thats OK because you can use Audacity or any othe audio converter. Audio quality is only as good as the tape was which is to be expected. Overall we are pleased with its performance and recommend it to others. 4 stars"
2,Croscill Townhouse Wastebasket - Amazon.com,"[...]I have bought numerous items from Amazon and have never had a problem. Everything arrives super fast, including the free shipping items!

2,Good product - recommended to buy,"i am writing this after 3 years i bought this product, till now they are working like charm, strongly recommended to buy."
1,sunbeam breadmaker,"Never recieved item, have no idea whom to contact. paid for, but no breadmachine. Will never buy anything ever again from this company or Amazon.com."
2,This is a fantastic product!,I've paid a lot more for others that do not work half as well as these do. Happy with purchase!
2,AN INSTRUMENT THAT SURPASSES ALL INSTRUMENTS,"Rachelle is the best thing since slice bread. My entire family is an avid fan (from my 3 year old niece, who can sign all the songs, to my daughter who has Cerebral Palsy). We are never bored because her voice is one of the finest instrument I have ever heard. I feel a kindship with this beautiful soul just by her music. Some of the notes she reaches bring tears of joy. I am truly blessed to have this wonderful Light & Sound of a sister in my life. I was turned on to her last year by my Sister-In-Law and we have been turning others on to her. Everyone loves her - Catch a Concert and you will be amazed and uplifted."
1,30 Harry Connick Jr.,I was amazed and very sorry that Mr. Connick did this album. I have all his cds and I was very disappointed in this piano playing cd. Please Mr. Connick go back to singing with your band.
2,Quite an Original!,"This was a no nonsense, get the job done sort of story. It was practical, yet still unbelievably moving. A tear jerker for certain. Highly recommend!"
1,Did somebody say pretentious?,...As nauseating and self-congratulatory as the catalogs used to be - only not as well written.
2,Fantastic Deal,"I did a lot of research before ordering this piano. Even so, I was very surprised at how much was included for this price. A WONDERFUL Yamaha digital piano with many fantastic features. The stand. The AC adapter. Even free lessons on music theory on a CD to get you started. Throw in all of the voices, sounds, songs, and ability to interface with a computer, and you have an unbelievable deal.The only down side is that the software it comes with doesn't load on my Mac :-(, but since most things don't, I wouldn't downgrade it just for that. It interfaces with Garageband, which is the software I already use, so that's enough for me.Oh, and talk about fun. I'm got this to practice my piano lessons at home, and the first day it came I had so much fun I went to bed with sore wrists. I kept trying out practicing my scales with different voices. I guess I'll have to ""space out"" my fun a little bit better in the future."
1,Basically worthless as a bike support,Unfortunately this device does not work. It is just a piece of cheap plastic and unless your bike weighs less than perhaps 5 lbs it most likely will fall over. Amazon is a great (.com) company and should remove this worthless product from their inventory. The wheel arch is totally unstable and from the photos it looks sturdy but do not be fooled I think you may be sorry you purchased it. I am amazed at many of the other reviews that are positive but I do not know if they use it to support a kids tricycle or toy.
1,Ewwwwww!!!!,Every time I tried to read this book it was soooooo bad it made me throw up a little in my mouth!!!!
2,Truly a survivor....,"Little Mary has surely grown up to be an amazing woman, to share such a horrific story of abuse and sadness. Hers is a story of courage,hope,inspiration and ultimate triumph..I love the book and can't wait to see the movie,some day soon,I hope......"
1,Bone-A-Mints,My dog will eat these but they are kind of difficult for his little teeth. He is still excited by the smell and equates them with Greenies.
2,Baseball's number 1 game,"Triple Play 2001 is the most realistic baseball game I've ever played (I played a lot of gamew). It's everything a person wants; very good graphics, the updated rosters, and it's fun. Triple Play 2001 has amazed me once I installed it. I am 100% positive that it will amaze you to."
2,An outstanding package.,"I recently bought this package ... and was delighted with nearly everything. It shipped quickly, came packaged well and was very easy to put together using Delta's instructions. Except for being fairly heavy and hard to lift (ask a friend to help set the saw on the stand) everything went smoothly and was operable in less than 2 hours. This was my first mobile base, but certainly not my last. How wonderful! The included blade is not great but a good spare to have around for tighter curves in thinner material. The only drawback was that the included fence was about 1/32"" out of plumb with the table. The rails are perfectly level with my top, but the fence tilts slightly toward the blade. I'm sure this will only affect very tall stock and I can add an auxilliary fence if needed, but thought that was a little disappointing. Otherwise a very nice package."
2,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This book was given to me as a gift from my mother-in-law. I am so thankful she did give it to me. It is such a wonderful book! It was like God was right there reading these ""love letters"" to me Himself. It really makes you look at your life in a different way. I would recommend this book to any woman! We are all God's princess' and need to know it! :) If you haven't read this book yet, TODAY is the DAY to get it and read it!"
1,Horrible,"This movie is horrible. The storyline starts of slow and the fight scenes are repetitive, uninteresting and bland. A muay thai autistic star? cmon thats garbage!!!"
1,Missed Opportunity,"I pulled this book off my shelf hoping to use it for a Blues History class I'm teaching this semester. Then I remembered why it's been sitting on the shelf unused for years: this would-be wonderful anthology has on index of musicians or song titles. Yes, in this collection of hundreds of blues lyrics, there is absolutely no way to locate the lyrics of a particular musician, or the lyrics to a particular song. Instead, the lyrics of King Solomon hill are located in the ""New Orleans to Jackson"" chapter, and Robert Pete Williams ""I Got So Old"" is located in the chapter titled ""Somewhere to End."" How clever and useful. There IS a clear index of illustrations. Gee, thanks."
1,Beware!!!,"I spent over $30 for this book, (my fault). What a disappointment. How can a normal person afford such extreme measures?! HCG? Injections once a day? Not available in US though, maybe you could just get on a plane in your spare time and go to Germany! Organic, all natural, low sugar, low fat, were common sense, no new stuff, but was informative. I can't believe the money this author is making on the common customer that can't afford this stuff. He talks about movie stars losing all this weight because they went by this program. I suppose that could be true since a millionaire can afford it...Oh well, live and learn."
2,Very nice,I've had no problems with this watch. It keeps good time and works well. It's actually a bit smaller than I thought it would be. This is a good watch if you have small wrist like I do. One thing I like is the band doesn't seem to pull my arm hair like watches I've had in the past.
2,"Great, especially if you're a New Yorker","If you've ever walked through the Upper East Side and spotted a five year old dressed in his private school uniform carrying a lacrosse stick, you'll understand that people like the X'es really do exist. The people decked out in designer bests at Tiffany's and Bergdorf's and Barney's with their minority caretakers in tow walk the streets of Manhattan every day.This book was very funny. I started reading it last night and finished it tonight."
1,Wow... Such an original plot....,"A poor, defenseless Chinese woman immigrates to L.A.'s Chinatown to seek a better life, but faces oppression from those around her (Asian Americans), until she is ""rescued"" by her (white) ""knight in shining armor.""If you enjoy movies which stereotype an entire group of people, then you should buy this.<sarcasm>"
1,"Oh no, the action stopped and they're having ANOTHER long-winded conversation.","I absolutely love Marjorie Liu's Hunter Kiss books. Dark, beautiful prose. That said, this book is so different it's as though it was written by a different author. There are small spurts of interesting action that pull the plot along... only to be mired down a page later with too much repetitive dialogue. I really wanted to like the main character Dela Reese and her love interest Hari, but after the umpteenth overwrought conversation about her protection, safety, and emotional well-being... ugh. This book became a tiresome mess. Also, I bought this as a Kindle edition and it's jam-packed full of typos. Annoying."
1,A Waste of Money,"My Jobar Folding Clothes Rack was thrown out with the trash today. When it first arrived, it had a light coating of rust on each part. I built it anyway, which was no easy task since it was incredibly flimsy, then took it outside and sprayed it with Rustoleum. It was lopsided when open, and it wouldn't close properly when it was time to put it away. I thought I would take it apart and donate it to charity, but it didn't survive the process of removing the screws."
2,"Nice...very, VERY nice!","These guys have always worked harder than anybody else to deliver a high-energy, great-sounding, professional concert- and that is just what you get. The sweat is just pouring off of them as they rock out! This performance doesn't try to be something it is not; it is raw and in your face! You get to see 4 of the best (and most under-rated) musicians of metal up close and true to form. I have also really enjoyed the audio CD included. It has a good mix, and it is solid & consistent. The bonus material was cool as well. (You get to see rare glimses of Carlos Cavazo acting goofy!) This DVD is true to their live shows, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. So... buy one for you AND your friends!P.S. I can't stop singing THUNDERBIRD from this recording!!!"
1,Enjoy Directv Tivo on good old black and white...,"Buyer Beware. The N750 will not record off the Directv Tivo hard drive in color. Why? Who knows. Certainly not Sony, who denies a problem exists, despite post after post from affected owners of the N750 and N700 on various websites (eg, Tivo community) that all complain of the identical issue. Even after I proved I could record in color using a borrowed 8yr old Zenith VCR and the identical cables/hook-up and tape, Sony refuses to acknowledge a compatability issue with Tivo. They did make me the generous offer of shipping me an identical, ""refurbished"" model for $45-$80 dollars (depending on warranty status)...that also won't work. If you enjoy color, and you own a Directv Tivo, buy another brand! If you want to spend quality time with Sony's head in the sand, technical support gurus, then the N750 is the unit for you."
1,Skin looks great but....,"this stuff burns my eyes! I have used it for a few weeks and I was so happy with how my skin looks I didn't realize that this is why my eyes were burning every morning. I am careful not to get it in my eyes, but when I wake up it almost feels like pink-eye (but it's not). I'm fine once I put my contacts in, and I'm fine when I don't use the lotion, but if I try to go back to it, my eyes burn. The smell is strong but not too bad, and my skin is smoother (not tight, but fresh feeling), but I can't imagine this is good for my eyes so I'll need to stop."
2,"A Modern Fable, of Humor and Wisdom","The Characters in the book are unforgettable. From Aira Flight, the super girl that is oh so human, to Mendle Orion, a guy who wants a woman for her soul, to Onx, the dragon dog, oh I really want a dragon dog now. The characters and plot kept me guessing until the end. The humor mixed with the quotable wisdom on almost every page supports the theme of the book. The book design is outstanding, for example each chapter is set up as minutes on a clock and the end of the book, is the count down. Exciting read, a real escape into another world yet holds to associated reality and wisdom for our own world. Sometimes the style is fairy tale like and the language is formal, but I think the author was going for that. Hence it's a modern fable.Found this book for as little at $12.00 and as much as $179.00 why? It would have been nice to get it for my Kindle."
1,Turning Tricks With a Crucifix,"Talk about blasephemy! A book this nasty, vain and ill-written could not possibly have been inspired by the Lord Almighty. Beware of men who turn the misery of ostensible friends and loved ones into object lessons for the rest of us. The sheer number of factual errors in this screed could fill an entirely separate book. I know, I know, you can easily imagine how terrible it is... trust me it's even worse than you think."
1,Not a good toaster,"We've owned this toaster for about a year now. I'm not sure why I've put up with it this long. It is completely inconsistent. We keep the knob between 2 and 3 and do not move it. At this setting, sometimes the toast gets completely burnt (like this morning), sometimes we get warm un-toasted bread, and sometimes it comes out perfectly (why I give it two stars instead of one star). There is also no consistency between the two sides of the toaster. Both sides will be set between 2 and 3 and will be pushed down at the same time. One side will come out burnt to a crisp while the other will be done nicely. If you want a toaster that only occassionally gives you good results at unpredictable times, this is for you."
1,"Dated, Boring, Unintentionally Funny.","I picked this up used after the German film ""Downfall"" reawakened a long-dormant fascination with the freakshow that was National Socialist Germany. I was disappointed. Shirer's prose is inelegant and heavy-handed. After about 300 pages, I gave up. But not before reaching this amusing nugget: ""Many of the [S.A.'s] top leaders, beginning with its chief, [Ernst] Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lietenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a covicted muderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and fueded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can."" Good luck getting something like that published in 2005."
1,Trouble,"Try to get a hold of these guys and get some help. The friendly voice may say average wait time is 6 minutes, but I wound up on hold for 30+ minutes both times I called. Had trouble setting up both wireless and straight ethernet and tech support wasn't much help. It is in the box on the way back to Linksys."
1,Rod too soft,"the rod is too soft and thin. I need this to support cable wire and hang the shower curtain at a L-shaped, but the rod is too soft and actually gets bend in by the tension."
2,"stab, hack, slash, kill.","Cry_Wolf is a great, lesser-known slasher movie that harkens back to the '80's, red-herring laden, ""who is the killer?"", slasher movies. teens running from a masked killer with a knife: what's not to love?"
2,Must for all rock fans,"The New BOC album ""Curse of the Hidden Mirror"" is as good as any that they band has done. Buck is playing his magical guital licks better than ever. For those of you who like old BOC there are some gems from the past. For those who like the melodic albums (Specters, Mirrors) there is stuff for you too. And for those who really want to ROCK, well it is BOC afterall.Can't say enough about this disc. The Oyster boys are in top form. Listen and I am sure that you'll agree!!"
1,Product description lacking detail,"I've heard great things and was excited to try Maca. What concerns me is that vitamin E is listed as an ingredient in this product, but the amount is left off of the label. If you are like me and take other vitamin supplements as well, you need to make sure you aren't over doing it on some areas. Since I have no way of knowing how much vitamin E is in this product, I feel uncomfortable taking it with my other multivitamins. High doses of vitamin E are not good for you. It wouldn't have taken the company much work to fix this inconsistency, but I won't buy this product again unless it's properly labelled. It's cheaper than other brands, but I'll pay a little more in the future to not have to worry."
1,Disappointed.,Was expecting a lot from this product because its black and decker. Used it for a few months and the suction is almost non-existent. The on and off switch was not made properly because it looses some suction through there.
2,For all of us,"An excellent lesson in faith, tolerance, and trust in God - things that may not give instant reward, but provide long term grace."
1,HEEEEEEEEEEEY,"What is going on here!! I just took 2 scoops and I'm falling asleep. I know people develop a tolerance, but this is ridiculous. I'm wondering if there is any trace of superpump I used to take in this product I got. Is this a new formula or did somebody sell me trash? Remember the stomach problems? Nope, not there any more. Not that I miss them, but to me it is just an additional proof that something major has changed I just don't know what it is. I will not buy this product again, beware of the seller!!!"
1,Not the real thing,"What I received was not the real ""Realities by Liz Claiborne"" but a fake product in packaging that was made to resemble the real thing (but was not the real packaging). Seller should alert people that what they're getting is a knock off, not the real thing. It doesn't even have the same smell. This was a big disappointment. I would not buy from this seller again."
1,"to me,mcqueen was great....BUT","I saw this movie,when it first landed in theaters.It is a little western.Will Penny was(is) a little Western--Will Penny is great--Tom Horn is less than great--Steve M. wants you to beleive he is like the real Tom Horn...I found it all very pretendious--McQueen should have done better---they say he was feeling bad--sickness that would end his life--Steve was a great actor--throw this movie and his last movie(the hunter) out--watch Steve in Nevada Smith--Bullitt---Love with a proper Stranger--Cincinnati Kid--Sand Pebbles--The Mag Seven--The Great Escape--Forget Tom Horn and The Hunter because I think he was sick when he made these films--there's only one Steve Mcqueen and who ever he WAS is not in these forgetable films--"
1,Gun With The Wind,"These guns do not work on flat screen, LCD, or plasma televisions. So, unless your TV is an older model, don't waste your money. I wish someone had mentioned that fact before I let my kid spend his allowance on it.No more Duck Hunt."
2,The Best For Wilderness Travel,"For wilderness travel the Delorme atlases are the best maps I've found to have in your pack aside from a backpack full of USGS and Forest Service maps. If you're interested in a road atlas, something to use while traveling around in the safety of your vehicle, then get a Thomas Guide (the best ROAD atlases in the world). The Delorme atlases show you all the land features, topography, public lands boundaries, and waterways (even the minor and intermittent ones). I've used three of these atlases while traveling on foot through the national forests, and they have literally saved my life many times. The one and only complaint I have about these atlases are their size; they're huge, and for an atlas whose contents seem to be designed for wilderness travel that large size just sucks when trying to find pack space for it. Fortunately, they fold in half easily, which helps a lot."
2,"Just as described, basic and a-ok!",This item is just as described and it works perfectly in the toilet room in the space between the toilet and wall. Good gift for Dad!
1,Disappointing after all the hype,"This action movie sins in the worst possible way - it's boring! There's no sense of fun anywhere (see 'Iron Man'), and the action sequences are dull and predictable (has no one seen the 'Kill Bill' movies? They came out years ago!). Even the acting was pretty stilted - I thought Rorschach was pretty decent, but everyone else was bland, bland, bland.I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, ""graphic novel""). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed. Maybe this movie does that for 'Watchmen' fans, I dunno. But for me, I couldn't wait for the end.(The disparity between die-hard fans and everyone else might also explain why the IMDB rating is a very high 7.9, but metacritic is significantly lower at 56)"
1,If you read first half you gotta read this,"and you will be disappointed. A civil war begins, main hero steps up as leader of rebellion, a third side appears in civil war, and lot of stuff gets complicated and little solved, and mood is not even close to adventurous/mystery mood of book one.I couldn't say that this series, 'Long Sun' really ends here, it seems that Short Sun is sequel, but I didn't read it yet.When Wolfe has idea and inspiration, he is best. When not, he is worst."
2,Great!,I had a hard time finding a plastic container with buckles that were this dimension. They stack nicely when full and also stack nested when you have a few not in use. However there was a strong chemical smell when first opened - I would recommend airing these out before storing and closing the lid on them.
2,A new looks at blues.,"With Shades of Blue, Al Petteway once again proves why he is one of the finest fingerstyle guitarists and composers. This is not a standard blues CD, although there is plenty of blues and ragtime on it, if that is what you are looking for. Instead, this is a series of compositions in, as the CD's title points out, shades of blue, variations on blues themes.Al's style is pleasing and clear. His compositions range from enjoyable to moving. He plays with as much heart as he does skill, and his skill is considerable. I have listened to this CD over and over since getting it, and I am still not tired of it.I particularly enjoy ""After Dark"", ""Smoky Mountain Morning"", ""Alphonso Brown is Back in Town"" (read the liner notes on this one), and the truly moving ""Requiem"".The only thing missing from this CD is Amy White, who makes this already great musician even better, more soulful. She is the other half of the orange. That said, this is a great CD and will not disappoint."
2,Students Enjoyed this movie,"I chose this movie for two reasons: First, we are reading the classic story of the Civil War; second, it starred Audie Murphy, another great American classic. Although the movie was not true to the storyline of the book, students were able to acknowledge that the events in the movie did occur in the book, and they loved the dramatization."
1,Go with Norelco,"After tens of years of blade use, I purchased this Braun. The results were extremely disappointing. Even with time consuming, over and over trips, the shaves were not close. After 2 weeks, I talked my son into trying, and I used his 3-year old Norelco. What a difference! The Norelco's shave was much cleaner, and much faster than the Braun. After a few days, my son was begging for his Norelco back. Even though his beard is significantly lighter than mine, he couldn't get a close shave either.Today I returned the Braun, and just prior to writing this review, I ordered a Norelco."
1,Danny Glover ruins it,It would be OK if Danny Glover didn't open his pie hole. His feeble soapbox standing ruined it for me.
1,Bad Stitching,"We bought 3 of these bags & 2 of the 3 were defective. The straps were not stitched well & broke 10 min into our hike. We had to tie different straps together to continue the hike. We are returning them for a refund, beware check stitching if you buy this backpack."
2,One of the best New England Cookbooks,"I have had this book for several years. After travelling around New England, I found many of the true recipes for meals I have had right here in this book. It also has a lot of Portuguese recipes familiar to Cape Codders. From chowders to wonderful seafood recipes for haddock, cod, lobster and clams it moves to blueberry recipes, cornbread, jams, cakes, punches...the famous knock-your-socks-off Fish House Punch. Ever been to Galilee in Rhode Island? Find the recipe for their clam fritters here. Beach Plum jam, oysters, mussels, pea soup, roast venison, gingerbread, candies, fig pudding...all real ""people"" food. This small book packs a lot of punch."
1,Don't waste another dime!,"I have a Z82. I have had problems similar to those of other reviewers. Especially the ridiculously expensive ink cartridges running dry after minimal usage. I'm done buying cartridges, and I'll never buy another Lexmark product again. I'll just use the Z82 as flatbed scanner and move on."
2,A great starting point for those interested in Data Mining,"This is a well written and interesting book on a complex topic. I especially appreciated the first four chapters, which provide a good overview of estimation and classification, and chapters 10 through 12 which describe the main algorithms, training and testing and troubleshooting."
2,Good Stuff,"ITs a pelican-- what more to say. On this model, just watch the depth, it is real shallow.... Not thier fault, mine."
1,Not for beginners!,"The step explanation is poor and the instructor goes too fast, as if she were in a hurry to fit everything she has planned in 10 minutes. I could not follow her at all and ended up discouraged and quit after 2 minutes. The instructor must think that just because she says, ""You can do it!"" repeatedly her audience can ""osmose"" the complicated steps she presents. This 10 minute solution is no solution at all."
1,Check dates!!!,"I actually bought this product a few days ago at a chain drugstore.I had some serious trouble applying the product, then found it didn't stay on very well and some of the packets were so shriveled that I couldn't get any product out of them and had to try another, so I decided to look at reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else has any tips...Then, having read someone else's review about the same problem, I checked the expiration date on the box. 2 months past.As I said, since it doesn't stay on too well, and my yield from the box will be much less than 14 days worth, I have to say the whitening effect isn't so pronounced."
1,"Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow!!!!!!","""Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow!!!! Get them off me . . ."" - Me after 10 seconds of trying these on. Went straight back to Amazon."
1,never arrived,"I really cant rate this article. It was delivered (as your record in the tracking page) a month ago, on november 19th at 12:01pm, but it never came. The day before I got another article I think i bought under my husbands account Roy Acosta Valerín (royacova@costarricense.cr), they were two car seat bases Gracco, they arrive safetly and they're great, but the usb flash drive never arrived. I'm wondering what happened, I've never been in this situation, I've always received everything i ordered in the past, this the first time i'm having this problem, but the fact is that i already paid my credit card where you charge this item and still I dont have it. I really like to know what is the next step so i can get this article which i really need!!!"
1,nasty nas to what?,"aiight... illmatic was the best rap cd put out... ever. there is no way to continue to put out tracks like dat, cause maybe we all expect too much from nas now. however, he has taken tha sell out path and promotes to white kids who dont know n e thing about music, rather than the infamous QBC. a bunch of rappers now days r doing this however, like mobb deep, etc. this album isn't even worth purchace if u r a true nas fan... if u want raw, real qbc beats... look up some mobb deep infamous, or CNN, and especially cormega. real is real"
1,Misfits don't live up to the hype!!,The new misfits box set is kind of a clunker. It's like they're still in the 70's. The recording sound extremely dated to say the least.I say keep the $60! Jason B.
2,THEY'RE BACK!!!!!!!!,thats right folks after a 9 month break monday in londond is now back together and rocking just as hard as they ever did
2,The Virginian Season 3,"I'm half way through the third season and still love this series. Im anticipating the fourth season with the changes in cast members. Got to admit I miss Gary Clarke as (Steve Hill). Randy Boone as a new regular is quick witted and the music in the show is great. Randy Boone and Roberta Shore actually produced an LP together back in the 60's. James Drury and Doug McClure along with Lee J. Cobb are the glue in The Virginian. I know Roberta Shore eventually leaves the series and that will be interesting how it is handled. Don't want go give it away as some of you haven't ever seen The Virginian. To conclude, if you want to see a very family friendly series based on the old west this series is a true delight. Enyoy it."
2,Ladies shaver...,"Bought for my wife for convenience and portability, works great, keeps charge for along time, charges quickly, works as well in shower or dry.. Excellent value for money (and means less chance of her using my razor!)."
1,PLEASE do not buy! It might encourage them...,"Painful. That is the word to describe it. My toddler LOVES Thomas and I and my wife with him. But this movie is an abomination, regardless if you know the other Thomas films or not. Alec Baldwin is halfway cute, but Peter Fonda gives the worst acting of his career (and I like Peter Fonda). The story is painfully puzzled together. It seems like the producers took words like gold.dust.dog.railroad.friends.magic.grandpa.horse because they knew that those words were popular with viewers and mixed them randomly into a story and hoped for the best.They also deviated from the concept in the Thomas films that there is some not-so-nice-behaviour involved but nothing more drastic. Diesel is not ""Not-so-nice"", he is downright evil and destructive. This garbage is not for young kids.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!! IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEm TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!! WHO KNOWS WHAT GOOD ACTORS GET WASTED THE NEXT TIME AROUND!!!"
2,"awesome ""the original death metal band""","this is a classic,if you are a death metal fan ,find out were the roots are."
2,THE BEST OF THE SERIES,"It`s 2 bad that this film holds the number III behind its name... Because it is the best. Inventive, full of good humour and good acting. A N D special effects. It really should have been a sequel 2 the 93 blockbuster... THE LOST WORLD? There`s not enough sand 2 bury than one...Alessandro Nivola`s Billy is good, but his part should have been built up..."
2,Nice Swing! Trick to swinging too fast.,"We loved this swing and so did our daughter. It is nice to have the rotating swing. Our daughter loved the side-to-side motion. When she weighed less we had a problem with it swinging too fast but there is a TRICK... (it mentions it in the manual) you put a light weight blanket under baby and let it barely drag the floor. It works!!! I wouldn't use a heavy blanket or let it bunch up on the floor because it could be hard on the motor.It's easy to fold up and set aside when not in use.The motor is a little loud but baby will get use to it. Our daughter, like some babies, like continous noise when she sleeps anyway."
1,Crap,"Only works, sporadically at that, with Microsoft programs. Most of the time will NOT recognize your fingerprint or log-in information. An expensive piece of light and plastic. If you love the headache, glitches and freezes that Microsoft is notorious for providing....add this $50+ to that list! If you work hard for your money, then investigate a competitor's product. This is a piece of garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The Ultimate Horse Book,"I wasn't happy with my book because I ordered a ""new condition"" book, and they sent me a old copy with rips and pen marks all over it, even though I payed extra for my book to be store new. When they sent me my book, they asked that if there were any problems, to email first, and I did, asking how to return it and get a new one, or get my money back, and it's been a while since I sent it and I didn't receive a response."
2,Charming biography of America's premier wood engraver,"This biography is written by family members of Cole,who is regarded as America's premier white-line wood engraver. An autobiographical introduction starts thiscolorful summary of Cole's life and work. From humbleimmigrant beginnings, he rose to the top of his craftby the end of the 19th century. The book is illustratedwith a selection of his finest work, largely fromhis work on European masters. The text is of interestto art historians, but also has a general appeal as anintriguing biography of an accomplished engraver whotravelled Europe in search of masterpieces to render in wood. He then presented the essence of the paintings to the American audience through magazines such as Scribner's and Century."
2,I miss my Kerry,"Best mechanical pencil ever. I've owned hundreds of different ones, but this is the only one that has the perfect balance of features. Most importantly, it just works beautifully. This pencil ejects just the perfect amount of lead, and has just enough of a lead sleave to support the lead so that it won't break during normal use. Every other pencil I've ever used, the lead breaks if you put too much pressure on it.Loading this up with some soft 2B lead, and I'm as happy as can be. Lost my last one, so I've got to go out and order a replacement. I wish I could find these cheaper in bulk!"
2,"Interesting, yet rife with opinion","Present me with the culture, the people, their customs and beliefs; but not your judgment or opinion. This book compiles essays from the books and notebooks of many anthropologists who have studied cultures from all over the world, both past and present. It provides information for the beginning level study of anthropology along with the many essays. But many times, the ethnocentric opinions and judgments of the anthropologists seeped out into their writing."
2,Eye of the Dolphin DVD,"Eye of the DolphinThis is a nice story, kind of predictable. I enjoyed it because I love to watch dolphins. I liked the people and scenes from the Bahamas."
1,eTrex is not a trail model,"Very disappointing unit and I returned it immediately to purchase a a Garmin GPSMAP 60. The eTrex would not acquire *any* satellites in a wooded area in winter, no foliage. Seemed fine otherwise, but I don't think it should be marketed as a trail model. The GPSMAP 60 is super though, great sattellite acquisition and features, but costs a good bit more."
2,Very Nice Conditioner for Relaxed Black Hair,"Stimulations Super Moisturizing Conditioner is excellent for relaxed Black hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft but I don't use this conditioner exclusively from one relaxer to the next. I think this conditioner is best used for the 2 weeks or so after you get your relaxer touch up. If your scalp was burned a little during the process, this conditioner is really, really, REALLY, very soothing as well as moisturizing. I do find however that it dosen't seem as moisturizing in the last 2 weeks before my relaxer touch up. When my hair is really kinky, then I turn to Nexxus or Keracare for more heavy-duty conditioning. I do however highly recommend this product."
2,Great Bottles,These bottles are the perfect size and work great with the Avent Isis breast pump. I never had a problem with them leaking at all. You can freeze with them too. The 4 oz. size is perfect for the breastfeeding mother. The milk doesn't come out fast at all. Great bottles.
1,secret diary of god,"started very good, but it soon turned it a total nonsense i would not recommend it.the jokes about the devil and god where not really good although the idea behind this was good."
1,"Waste of Paper, Time, Effort, etc. etc. etc","A recent positive review compared this series to a chess match, moving all the pieces in place.What a load of tripe! This would have to be the slowest, longest, poorest played chess match in history.If you like endless description of what the characters are wearing, with little if any plot advancement, then this book is for you. Or if you want to read pages detailing the washing of silk (Who on earth reading a novel wants this?), read on brave reader. Perhaps an aid to sleep is what this book really should be marketed as.If you want to read great fantasy (as opposed to poor) read George RR Martin. There's honestly no comparison. Martin's work, as opposed to this mess, is focused, dramatic, exciting, has evolving characters, and is fun to read."

2,nice product,"These sweat pants are good quality the only thing , they don't offer pockets in them and this would be a great addition."
1,It's the History Channel so of course it has a conservative slant.,"Definitely a top down 'Great Man Theory' production without any real information on how normal, average people like you or me lived. After all, it is 'The Story of US', right? Or supposed to be. In short, expect more bland stories about Lincoln etc. fitting for an elementary school aged child than any real meaty discussion of 'The Story of Us'.This kind of streamlined storyline that accentuates the leaders seems oddly conservative to me.Maybe not."
2,This is one of the few styling products ...,This is one of the few styling products that I've found that actually works on my hair. I have permed hair and this gel hasn't made it go flat or make it frizzy. I also like the pump bottle. I recommend this one.
1,"Decent story, poor execution","I picked up the Thief Lord after hearing so many comparisons to it and to Harry Potter. After finishing it though, I realized that the two books/series could not be further apart. Harry Potter books are successful because the characters and relationships are so well thought out and, while the magic may be fantasy, the relationships seem real. In this book, the story almost never strays from real life into fantasy, except in the development of the actual characters. The main character, Victor, is almost a characature of a dumb detective, and is never even believable as that. His relationship with the kids who are the focus of the book borders on the rediculous and later development of a ""relationship"" between him and a female characer comes from nowhere, with no build up. No one is really believable as a real life character.I give it 2 stars though because the most central character, the city of Venice, was described and included so well in the story."
2,A pleasurable read,"An college professor and I loved the Foxtrot strips dealing with Paige, Jason and ""Lord of the Rings,"" and so I bought this book almost entirely for those few cells.The entire book, though not one of Amend's longest, is still a highly enjoyable read. To anyone who enjoys Foxtrot (or comics like Foxtrot- witty word play, social commentary without lecture) this book would make an excellent addition. The strips dealing with Paige's obsession with Orlando Bloom, and Jason's horror at the possibility of having to share his Tolkein passion with his sister, is humor at its best (especially as an appreciative fan of both Tolkein and Orlando Bloom).I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Foxtrot comics."
2,The best of the sims,"É simplismente o melhor!now, you can buy a car and go out to visit the city, and have a chance to be famousVamos, compre logo! = buy now!"
2,Joan Crawford In The Wild West,"Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCaimbridge play rival touugh ladies in this western allegory about feminism, the red scare, and mob rule. Crawford shows why she was a major star--her authority is unquestioned. McCaimbride is amazing."
1,BORING,"I am very much an Anita Blake fan, despite her nerve-wracking immaturity. I agree with some of the reviewers here that this book was pretty boring. I didn't feel the plot was great and WHEN is the ardeur going to calm down? Has Laurell decided that she's going to write sex scenes without a good story? I am so happy that I stopped buying these books and now get them from the library because I would consider this a waste of money."
1,Not your mothers Liz Claiborne,I was looking for the original Liz Claiborne scent that I fell in love with in the Nineties. I was told that this was the one but it is definitely not the scent that it was back then. Both my wife and I were disappointed and I can't return it as they don't seem to allow returns on perfumes.Waste of money here.
1,Defective Copy,"Many unprinted pages (114, 115, 118, 119,122, 123,126,127,130,131, 134,135, 138, 139, 142, 143) that neither Princeton Paperbacks (not sold directly by them) or Amazon (more that 30 days) would stand behind.This is a book that gave me additional prspestives to i."
2,"Good Quality, Excellent Price","For the price, this is a top notch set. Have not used them, but look very solid!"
1,"One of those bad ""lets put young actors into a bawdy, medieval romp"" film.","While the film could have been an interesting big screen adaptation of the Casanova tale, with lots of young and up and coming actors and actresses, it falls into the trap of looking like modern day actors forced into these medieval roles. They just don't pull off looking like they should be in that time frame. Many, many comedic attempts have tried to go the bawdy romp route and failed, and this one is no different.For a much better movie, and similar theme, look no further than television and the British production (shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater) ofCasanova (Masterpiece Theater). It's a tremendously better play on the same plot, and you can see the production quality and performances are all a notch or two above this sophmoric, direct to DVD flick."
1,not good as I thought,"after reading all the reviews, I thought this is a good to buy, after it arrived, I gave it to my son who is 7 month old, but he doesnt like it at all. Then I found out it is too dry for his mouth. I tried it by myself, the taste is ok, no suger taste which is great. It reminds me what I had when I was little back to china. However, I can find the same stuff in a nearby chinese store for much cheaper price. If you have any chinese store nearby, I dont see any reason to have it for this expensive price."
2,"Bubble Mailers, work with creases","These are fine, except they have some of them have some creases on the fronts, making it a little difficult to write addresses - have to make sure the crease doesn't affect the info the post office needs!"
2,Good retrospective,This cd covers chronologically all top songs during this band's existence. I enjoy having it in my collection and put it in cd player when I want to hear those amazing vocals of Jay Black again. Singers today are NOT like that. Then we had words with meaning.... Today they scream on stage or whine a note out with no words behind it and you can't understand what they are trying to say.
2,Health Care Financing,"Anybody that is concerned about the rising costs of health care in America should read this book. As a physician, I am disappointed at the lack of leadership in medicine as well as among the politicians.We are sending the current bills for health care to our children. Gov Lamm's book provides great insight into the fiscal problems we are facing and provides some good suggestions on how we might go about addressing the problem."
1,A weak prequel to Alien,"Film directors should avoid all temptation and stop making prequels. Star Wars Episode 1-3 were lackluster and Prometheus is even worse. Were you really spending the past three decades wondering about the Engineer and where the Aliens came from? It's here, but you could have been told in 10 minutes. The script is deadly dull and I didn't really care about any of the characters. Compare that to the original Alien where I liked the entire crew and hated to see them get picked off. I was so bored in the final scenes I fell asleep."
2,Another quality DEWALT product,Worth the cost for those of us who really put the cordless tools to work. The quick turn-around of two 18v batteries to a full charge is a huge bonus for me when the wood chips are really flying in my shop... it lets me keep working without delay or distraction.
1,Disaapointed,"I purchased the Acoustic wireless speakers so that I would not have to run wires throughout my home. The speakers are supose to operate UP TO 300 feet away from the source. As long as they were in the same room they seemed to work just fine, but move they to another room and they sounded terrible. Then after about a week the whole system failed. I sent the system back for a refund. I guess this is what I should expect from a product made in China.Alan"
1,Not a Complete Reference Book,"I picked this book partly due to the fact that it came with the complete medical dictionary on a CD. It would be great to leave the book at school and install the software on my home computer...medical books are heavy!!!Unfortunately, most of the medical words that I've had to look up in my courses have not been in this reference book. I'm taking a medical secretarial course, so this book would be a major disappointment for anyone taking nursing or medical."
1,OH MAN HOW I HATE THIS FLUFF!!!,"The first song ""Climb that Mountain High"" is o.k. It promised to be a good traditional CD. The next cut ""Rumor Has It"", the title track was even better and I thought...oh boy...she's come back!! Then I heard the rest of it and got madder and madder as each song got worse and worse!!! And when I heard her do ""Fancy""....I almost threw the CD in the garbage!! I can't understand why anyone would record such an ugly song!!"
1,AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!,"This product worked great for almost five years until it developed a leak. I've learned online that this leak is common and is due to a poorly designed seal between plastic and steel pieces. Obviously, Rowenta doesn't care about those who use their products if they design something so poorly. You'd think they outsource their engineering to Kenmore, expert of the ""break a day after warranty"" gimmick. There's nothing duo power about this when it's sitting in a puddle of is own water.I pulled a B&D; that I'd recovered from the trash years ago. It does the job without leaking. Never again, Rowenta!I gave it two stars rather than one as it gave us five good years. I guess we're some of the lucky ones with this unit."
1,Save Your Money!,"This CD player is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. It didn't take long for me to find out how badly made it was either. First of all, the radio doesn't pick up radio stations very well. A station that I used to listen to quite clearly on my old $29.99 radio came in very weakly on this one. I've only had the item seven months and the CD player is broken. The antenna always wobbled and looked very cheaply made. As I was adjusting it one day, it bent and then snapped right off!This is the most cheaply made item I've ever bought. I had my old $29.99 radio for over ten years. This item is already falling apart in eight months. Don't buy this item unless you want to waste your money."
2,excellent belt. definetly will continue to use it on future travels.,"Used this in Italy. Kept our cash and passports in it. Has a waterproof plastic pouch inside. It rained really hard one day in Rome, and surprisingly nothing got wet. I will definetly use this on future travels."
1,some kind of sick joke,"essentially, konami needed some loot for christmastime: their solution, releasing this and gradius.The graphics in this are a must see. They are creepy. The players look like showroom dummies animated to exact their revenge on the olympics.The gameplay is the opposite of confusing. I don't really understand how ""press buttons fast"" can be confusing, especially since they pummel how to play into your head before each event.I rented it, and took it back after 5 hours and got a different game because i had gotten gold in each event the 2nd time trying.Maybe konami had a deal with sony to invent a game that would only break your controllers..."
1,Don't waste your money,Had to send it back. It would not stay glued to the dashboard. It was a complete joke. Might as well put double sided- tape on the bottom. Would hold better
1,This Book is a [deceptive],"The author just wants you to PAY HIM FOR COACHING! He won't give you enough information in the book to design your own training program and he won't answer a simple question about his book without GETTING MONEY FROM YOU IN ADVANCE. He's a con artist and put this book out to promote his ""coaching"". (...)"
2,The Ghost Breakers,"One of Bob Hope's best pictures. His third with Paulette Goddard and they both are excellant in all of them.Bear in mind that attitudes towards African Americans were different in 1940 than they are now and Willy Best as Hope's""Old family detainer"" is excellant. He has a great segment on a pier with a drunk that is very funny and transcends racial barriers especially for the time.This movie is well worth watching time and time again."
1,"Not only abridged, but badly formatted",This kindle book is one of the most difficult to read that I have ever purchased. The formatting for the recipes does not fit on the kindle screen so all of the words end up in a mish mash that is very difficult to decipher. Chapters are not clearly defined and it is difficult to search for a drink and find the recipe quickly. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this book and would not recommend it to anyone.
2,cute,my dog likes the house more than the concept...he cheats and shakes the house until all the squirrels fly out.
2,Part Of 3 Rarities Comps,"Derek Lawrence produced alot of bands and sessions in the 60s, this collection featuring many gems some of which are unreleased. Included are rarities from Richie Blackmore solo and with his bands Green Bullfrog and The Outlaws, Jethro Toe (Tull), Albert Lee, Hot Chocolate, and others. 20 tracks in all from 1965 to 1970."
2,Hand it to Covey--And A Recommendation,"The Seven Habits of... does indeed show you how to be more effective. What I like about the book is that Covey isn't just a cut-throat, success-at-all costs adviser. Embedded within his ""system"" of effectiveness is the recognition of the importance of quality of life; while your professional bottom-line is likely to improve if you follow his advice, that's not the whole point. Another book I recently finished and loved, which gives practical advice with a strong undercurrent of wisdom is The Mindful Money Guide. It addresses all the various aspects of one's financial life and can help improve your fiscal bottom-line, but without losing your soul. It's also fun to read."
1,"Faulty product, absolutely no support!","Stay away from Netgear products! Mine rarely works and I can get no response from Netgear what so ever. Take a look at the discussion board on their own web site for this product, you will find a long list of people having the same problems and getting the same response from Netgear...none! Mine is going to sit on the shelf above my computer as a reminder, to do better research before buying."
1,Great to watch if you're on drugs!,"My husband bought this DVD for me, thinking it was live performances. Well, when we started watching it I decided the graphics were probably meant for people who are high at a party. Don't get me wrong, the music is fine, but to watch a lot of the videos made me dizzy. I love U2 and have for 20 years. But come on, this DVD should have a warning sign on it! Don't view if you're sober or conservative."
2,Definitive and insightful!,Over the years their have been numerous heated arguments about Tolkien's works. I used to get upset myself in some of these arguments until I realized one thing. Tolkien's books are fantasy and entertainment and limited only by my imagination. Above all Tolkien wanted his books to be enjoyed. Realizing such I hardly ever read other peoples opinions or enterpretations of his work and instead rely on my own imagination. This is the exception and the first book I have read where I either agreed with everything written or wouldn't be able to argue otherwise. I consider Michael Martinez's writings to be just short of the gospel on all things Middle Earth. He is obviously very learned and insightful and I enjoyed his writings very much. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Tolkien. WELL DONE!
1,Wrong CD!!!,"I ordered this CD and expected ""Robert Kekaula's"" Kanak Attack only to find that it was nothing to do with Robert Kekaula. I emailed them about the mistake and have not heard from them since to make arrangements for an exchange or refund. I've ordered from them before and never had a problem. Hopefully they'll read this and contact me to fix the problem."
1,"In Full Cry? Yes, you will be after listening to this tosh!","I'm a huge fan of ECM's music - sparse arrangements, gentle melodies and overall slower pace. And I understand that improvisation plays a big part in jazz. But after 20 minutes of listening to people essentially tuning their instruments with no melody, no pace and no rhythm, I gave up. All I could hear were honks and screeches, interspersed with thumps on what passes for a drum. Maybe the good stuff starts at minute 21, who knows? Frankly I don't care. I'm too busy living up to the title of this piece of junk - shedding tears in full cry for having wasted good money."
1,Cheap Knives Should Not Be Sold As Wusthof,"The Silverpoint knives may look good in the pictures, but they are NOTHING like the quality of the Wusthof Grand Prix knives. The weight is about a third of the same Grand Prix knife. The blades are flimsy and they don't have the same balance as the more expensive quality Wusthof lines. The Silverpoint knives are stamped and not forged like the other Wusthof knives. I ended up donating my Silverpoint set to Salvation Army, and bought another set - Grand Prix this time - to get the quality I was looking for. Do yourself a favor -- save your money and use whatever knives you currently have until you can afford to buy a Classic or Grand Prix set. Even at the $69.99 Amazon price, they are not a good deal!!!!"
2,"""Mac Not Afraid To Venture""","Word Of Mouth is not your typical Mac McAnally recording but when you think about it what IS a typical Mac McAnally recording? It is almost impossible to categorize Mac's music and that is what makes him so interesting. His willingness to venture into new unexplored fields is so refreshing and welcome. I'm sure that the fans of Mac's earliest recordings will be quite surprised at ""Word Of Mouth"" but give it a chance before writing it off. Mac's songwriting skills are again the highlight of the project and his warm, friendly voice always brings a smile. Be sure to pick up a copy and remember that on July 27 Mac's first two albums will be released on CD for the first time. Well worth the 20 year wait!"
2,Saves you so much money!,"This has really saved me so much money! It works great! I also had issues with the battery but then I noticed that if it is not all the way put together IE: the top that covers the metal plates are not on the light wont light up to indicate that it is working. The trap has caught several mice and is still working great, doesn't bother the cats or dogs but if they play with it they can open it easily so be careful. My cats just usually ignore it tho! This will save you so much money on mouse traps tho so I would recommend getting this."
2,Laugh Out Loud,"I read this book to my two children, and it made all three of us laugh out loud! There aren't many books which our whole family can enjoy, but this was one of them. There was something of value and humor for each of us, although we are very different ages. I recommend other familes enjoy this title."
2,Only thing my rabbit eats,"Only food my rabbit will eat consistently. They stopped selling it at the local stores. Glad I knew I could order it online!Tried to switch him to a new food, one with more seeds and what not, he didn't like it at all.When I switched him back to this food he wouldn't eat the brown pellets for a month or so...Now he eats them all again."
2,The best books I have ever read,"I would first like to thank everyone who has contributed in any way to the Princeton Review. I am a high school junior who believes your test prep books are by far the best books I have ever read. They are very concise and to the point and are currently helping me in studying for tests. I have purchased the SAT, ACT, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus Princeton Review Books. I am planning on taking the AP Micro and Macro Economics Exam this May. However, I have not been able to find any books on this subject. Please tell where I can find one or consider publishing one in the future. I know a large number of people who would be interested in buying an AP Economics book. Thanks again for all your help."
2,Prefect replacement,No issues with fitting. Works great and gives great tasting water. I have bought one every 6 months and have been very happy
2,Grand Trunk,"So far I have been quite happy with the product. I'm not certain how it will hold up, and I have read mixed reviews. This didn't deter me from purchasing. I also couldn't be happier with Amazon's customer service. The first shipment disappeared so they overnighted a second one. For that I'm greatful."
2,I love this video!,"I purchased Jane Fonda Prime Time: Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio and Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone & Flex CDs at the same time. So glad I did. I have been alternating the videos, which are very different.I selected the full 40 minutes of workout time on each video and realized how out of shape I was. Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio was the toughest. Perspiration was running down the sides of my face along with a full body sweat. Phew! Trim Tone & Flex truly works most muscles in the upper and lower body. I can tell which muscles are the strongest or weakest. I am definitely on my way to a healthier me.Thanks Jane for thinking of people that are really out of shape or need to bounce back from a health issue! These videos fit both.Amazon is a great online store to work with. Received my products intact and new. My favorite store online."
1,It doesn't get much worse,"A ludicrous plot, ridiculously disgusting, disturbing and unnecessary detail and unbelievable characters lowlight this horrible excuse for a thriller. I don't know if the author thought that he needed to shock with every sentence to draw attention to his first novel, but he makes every attempt. Unfortunately, the absurd plot and characters make this novel almost impossible to read. I was attracted to the novel by the quotes on the book jacket from a number of famous authors (who must've own the publisher a slew of favors). Shame on me. A real stinker."
1,Not worth the money.,"Cheap knockoffs of original style first sold on QVC. Plastic is thin and does not slide smoothly on carpet even with fairly light objects. Other brand ""as shown on TV"" also poor quality. Glue dries out and foam pad separates leaving them useless."
1,Stroller okay... Carseat HORRIBLE!!!!,"We purchased this travel system in another pattern in October 05. I don't mind the stroller, our 6 month old seems very comfortable in it. However, we have had endless problems with the infant seat!!! First of all, you can only use the carseat with the base (there are no slots to slide a seatbelt through on the carseat itself) We have two vehicles and it has been a real pain transfering and readjusting the base everytime! Second, our baby is only 6 months old and 15 pounds and for the last two months has felt too heavy for the seat. We are already seeing white distress marks on the handle! I loved the pattern of the set, and that is unfortunately the only thing I was looking for at the time so, please DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!"
1,More Instrumental Please!,"I love movie soundracks. They comprise at least 10% of my personal music.The intro by Linkin Park and the 4th track by Rob Dougan are excellent and powerful.However, I won't buy this soundtrack. It will be another example I'll use in my ongoing quest to ""voice"" my preference for instrumental music.I intensely dislike these particular Marilyn Manson & Rob Zombie tracks for their use of language and tone of voice, though I have enjoyed both artists work in the past. Granted there are other singers with talent on the disk, but the overall effect shows that more and more often, music is being cranked out simply to meet expectations of production/merchandising with only a fleeting glace at quality.I admit I'm impressed that we could get two CDs for the price of one, but again its quantiy over quality in order to sell.Thanks anyway."
2,An excellent cd of great songs from a great singer !,"Most people probably recognize Anita Bryant more for her 1970's orange juice commercials on t.v. and for her outspokenness on the subject of gay rights, but most folks who know Anita for only those two things are really missing out on Anita's great voice. Anita had several hits in the early 1960's-""Paper Roses"", ""Till There Was You"", ""My Little Corner of the World"", etc. Those are 3 fine songs and Anita's versions are the best. Also here are standouts such as ""Pretty Lies"", ""The World of Lonely People"", ""Cold, Cold Winter"" ""The Unopened Letter"" and the plum silly ""Sleepin' at the Foot of the Bed"". Then there's the lovely ""The Wedding ( La Novia)"" and ""Step by Step, Little by Little"". Anita Bryant had a great voice like Patsy Cline, and like Patsy recorded some darn good songs! This is a great cd. it wolud have benefited from the inclusion of a few more songs. Anita 's music is romantic and swings!"
2,Letters of Paul Book,The book was as advertised. Excellent condition and arrived promptly. Very pleased with the seller.
1,It was terrible!!!!!!!,"I hate, hate, hate this book! I don't know if you would like it or not but I don't. People don't have the same taste in books."
1,satisfy my rhatid!,"Channer has again wasted my time with another of his over-written, over-eroticized sorry excuses of fiction. He falls into that same bad habit (which he did in his first book 'Waiting in Vain) of name-dropping. It's as if the author is trying to prove to you how much he's read and how good he is -- and any intelligent reader should reel back at his failed cleverness and say ""No, Mr. Channer! No you aren't that good."" Not yet at least."
2,I've Never Bought a Green Day CD Before...,"But this one hooked me!I don't know what it is, but this is one kick ass album that I can't stop playing over and over again, and all of the tunes are so f'n catchy.I say, buy it, it's aiming to please, and it does, there's something on it for just about everyone."
1,suction power locks are not good products,this product is not very reliable as far as power locks are concerned... all this devices assembled with so called power locks tend to fall itself due to self-weight (dead weight) which are made of heavy plastic material (another bad product is shower caddy)... they fall even if you clean your wall 3 times with Clorox before fixing the contraception; this has been my experience... the manufacturer should think and apply mind to come up with a solution... the problem is with the rubber pads which should be wide enough to get good grip on the surface... they are almost covered by the thick plastic material at the back... so the rubber pads barely touch surface...also they should consider to make a container of lighter and tougher plastic... it takes quite a while to clean up the mess in the bathtub after things fall apart !!!
1,Had to read this for class,"I had to read this for class and I hated it so much I ended up reading the synopsis and got an ""A"" on my review. Shakespeare's style of writing is not what I would call an easy read. He uses unnecessary(sp) words and when you are trying to get a story read for a homework, that last thing I need is to read a confusing play that I don't understand. The premise of the story is entertaining so I would suggest reading a summary of the play."
2,The best movie of 1991,"I bought this little poster not only because it was the best movie from 1991 but also i played a bit part in the movie as ""Sweatless Wendall Banes"" My Name is Patrick Moccaldi, Thanks!!"
1,Could not stick with this one....,"This movie was not funny in the least...boring, stupid, and in some spots down right vulgar....do not let you kids watch this movie if they are under 16....IMHO!!!"
2,Good Overview of Training..,"I guess that's what the intent of this book and it gives examples from an expert in Training. The articles from several experts in the field of training also supports the content and adds value.Recommended if you need an overview, although in some chapters goes into details. Yet, there are several other books that focus on preparation, presentation, evaluation etc. which might be more focused on these topics."
2,Monsters Don't Scuba Dive,I am ordering these books for my youngest granddaughter. She loves them. When I got the books they were packed really well. And they got here really quickly. She got interest in them at school. But the school only had a few of them. They don't even have a complete set.
2,Punk and Its After Shocks review,"i thought this was a very good video if your a true punk fan. Really catches the image, bands and feeling of the new wave punk. I thought it was a very good video but i gave it 4 stars because of the exesive cursing."
2,BANG BANG BANG!,"This game is sort of like a stress ball. After a hard day at school or work, you can come home to this game and just shoot the crap out of everything. People shouldn't take this game so seriously, because the purpose of this game isn't to be an istant break away hit, it's only 20 bucks folks! The purpose of this game is to appeal to fans that don't want a lot of talk, or even a great storyline, they just want to see stuff blow up, which we all need sometimes. In addition, the weapons make you feel like a bad ass, sam's commentary throughout the game is hilarious, and for a 20 dollar game, the graphics are great. If what you require is a first person shooter masterpiece, well any idiot should know to get Halo, and if you are a ps2 devoute like myself, then check red faction (the first one, not the second), and if your need is a gamecube hit metroid prime is one of the only mentionable gamecube first person shooter!"
2,Works well,This thing works well but you have to be sure you place it at the correct angle. So far it has taken the abuse from my .22 rifle really well. As other reviewers have mentioned. You might buy a can of hunter orange spay paint to paint the targets because the decals don't last long. I would recommend this product.
2,Really nice book,"Thanks for writing this book. Even just reading chapter 1 got my head in a new space and helped me begin to make changes in my life in areas that seemed so difficult before. Better than a book on conversation, this book really cuts to the heart of dealing with tough issues, what you can do about them, and how to get better results at work and at home. I want to meet these guys!"
1,"Good concept, but not interesting to read","I recieved the book quickly, but was not impressed with the book itself. I struggled being interested in it and I was not able to finish it because of this."
2,"Cute, but not as big as I'd like","This baker is really chic and goes w/ the retro style of my kitchen perfectly, but I should've gone with a size larger. It's so cute I want to show it off to friends, but I can't fit the main course into this dish if I'm serving more than 4. (if people want seconds, it's only good for 3 people.)"
2,sailing with power,as a sailor who sails with sails and our whole family does it was still a very fun book to read and know that some of the things she had to do were very hard and sometimes scary and ver dangerous....but she did them and that is something she will carry all the rest of her life.
2,bullet open can,I received this trash can a month ago and I am totally delighted with it compared to my old trash can. The bag stays put and doesn't slide down into the can and the open top is very convenient.
2,Disclosure,"Must have book... Reveals really interesting information about UFO and what the U.S. government thinks about it, as well as tells us the extent to which the government will go to hide it's secrets. There are a lot of reports that through the book actually prove his point of view. The book makes you wonder what else is the government hiding. By nature i am a very skeptical man, and don't like to believe evverythin i hear however this book really explains the ""paranormal"" thought to us, which is actually really normal. i recommend this book to everyone, it's a great insight into politics and the effect"
1,2 person hammock - hah,"I received this hammock as a gift and it's going back.1. I already had a hammock stand and when I attached this to the stand (extending our chains to the very end it looks like its for children. Seems rather short.2. Box says up to 500 pounds, open up the packaging and roll out the hammock and the little piece of paper packed with it says maximum weight 350 pounds.3. It sags - I had it streched so I almost needed a step stool to sit on it it was so high on our large hammock stand, then sat it in and just barely cleared the concrete patio. Can't imagine what would happen if I layed in it for 30 minutes.The only good thing is it wasn't that expensive and it would be okay for 2 kids."
2,the best book to start your neurology,I had all the neurology books over the planet.This book is the best you can start your neurology residency with.It's not a management book no its diagnosis book.This is the first book every neurology resident should get without any doubt.
2,Excellent,"Along with Akira, this ranks as my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation is incredible. Very detailed with excellent use of CG. Also, the character design is also very good, not quite like any other anime I've seen. The plot revolves around the cyborg Motoko and a mysterious hacker. It gets quite complex, with all kinds of political machinations, so it may take a few viewings to understand."
1,"Love hockey, HATE this game","I love hockey. I have most of the EA games before this one and I really like them. So I rented this one, and thank God I only rented it. I hate this game. It wont save settings, passing in the game is incredibly stupid, and it will edit your lines automaticly if you sim any games. Plus the controls suck something fierce. If you like hockey than stick with NHL 2003 and pray that NHL 2005 is a lot better. Plus I only gave the game one star because there was no option to give it zero stars."
1,"Poorly presented, no use",It just like a series of unreadable words with equations. Poorly presented with not much explanation. Waste of time.
2,Very Soothing,"I love this CD. It's great to sleep to, to aid in meditation, and especially to help me calm down when I'm upset. This is my first pregnancy, and I need all the help I can get staying relaxed and worry-free. I especially love the affirmations!"
2,High quality Stoki,"I had this arrangement when it was available on Decca/London. I did not enjoy his Shostakovich Symphony No. 5 as much here as the version Stoki produced on Everest but many others did. A lot of critics called this version more impassioned and with deeper attachment that the seemingly more laid back Everest production.This is a concert reading of Stoki's rewrite of ""Pictures At An Exhibition"" which excludes a number of the pictures and takes a more Russian view of the score than Ravel's more international approach. By Russian I mean Stoki uses more low strings and woodwinds to make paint the portraits.All told, this is the old wizard in concert doing a pair of cornerstones of Russian music. If you've never heard this one it will give you an idea why any Stokowski performance can be such a revelation."
1,Another diet book you can toss,"The only reason I can think of for this book to be a best seller is that it has a catchy name; couple that in the diet world where people are always searching for that miracle and there you have it. The first chapter or so has you thinking it is a refreshing book with a nononsense attitude about it. However, the foul language and writing as if all written word is fact is a put off by chapter 3. (Yes, sometimes with research but on topics very ""gray""). Some of their opinions are good ones: don't eat sugar, excercise, etc. so take the rest with a grain of salt. Losing weight or staying fit will always come down to eating properly portioned, healthy food and excercising. PERIOD"
2,LUV IT,"I bought the CD for track 1 Rappers delight. Just put the CD player on single repeat sit back and enjoy. The rest of the album is fine, nothing tops that first track. To bad rap isn't still this much fun."
1,"Horrible Annoying CD, maybe suitable for teens only!","Well, after listening to 7+ french language series tapes and wanting just pure vocabulary ""boosting"", I was quite disappointed after popping this in the car cd player! Granted, it says for ages 10 and up, but the format and quality is really bad. Teen-sounding voices say a word (twice) followed by it's translation (twice) all with keyboard music playing in the background. It's impossible to concentrate with all the repetition and music, AND the french words do not sound like they are spoken by native french speakers; they sound like a group of latino teens posing as students who have studied french for five minutes. It goes like this (for example):hello (individual voice)hello (group of voices)bonjour (individual voice)bonjour (group of voices)The ""Learn in Your Car"" series is FAR SUPERIOR if you are looking for straight vocab review."
2,good bra,This bra--is true to size--it fits perfect--make solid---feminine--attractive---good support (good for larger sizes DD)..Haven't found a bra this nice in a long time--I ordered the cream color--and am going to order the black and white one as well.Good fit--back doesn't ride up--straps are fine--even thought they do not have the padded shoulder strap...this minimisor works well and is nothing like others I have tried that made me feel like I was in a vise..My Grandmother sold loungerie her whole life in a high end store---she always said Lilyette was the best brand---she may have been right!!!
1,What a piece of crap!!,"Spring is not strong enough to clode the door, even with new wheels. Directions are convoluted and difficult to read and understand (BTW, I teach physics and am a smart guy). Made of the cheepest materials and poorly engineered (mine broke after two days of use). For the love of all things good and holy, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! You'll be happier this way. Lastly, I had to give this a 1 star, since they do not allow zero stars."
1,Seriously? No Joke,"Wow, just wow. Low budget and seriously bad acting. Even the kills are lame. I cannot see recommending this to anyone. Just an obnoxious film. Look, I get the puns and spoof angle, but it's still a complete waste of time."
1,Disappointing,"I agree completly with the comments above, a large portion of this book is just a reprint of pdf's included with the package (Typos and All). It is difficult to find good documentation on the process of developing dreamweaver extensions and this book does not go very far in rectifying that problem. Laura Gutman's book on the same subject is a little older, but at least it is not a reprint."
1,Too Much Trouble,"I've had my pouring shield for about 5 years, and only used it once. I've tried to use it numerous times, but it comes apart when I don't want it to. It is very difficult to maneuver ingredients around this clumsy plastic piece. This is the only piece of Kitchen Aid equiptment that I have ever been disapointed with. I would certainly consider investing in something more useful than this piece."
2,FREE DOWNLOAD OF THIS BOOK,Great book! You can download this book for free in PDF.Just google JDK101 and click on FREE STUFF and look for it with other legal free books you can download also.You can also google or go to SCRIBD and put in Edwin L.Haislet or Boxing by Edwin Haislet in their Searh Engine and there are legal free downloads of this book also
2,Outstanding,"""The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to his White Mother"" Is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. From the moment I began I was unable to put it down unitil I was finished. It is truly a must read for all generations, colors, and creeds!"
2,Best Hamburgers Ever!,"Before buying my George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill, I read the reviews that were posted by previous buyers. After actually cooking on my grill, I can't understand some of the things other people wrote. I remember one person writing that the hole for the grease to drain into always got clogged. This is not true. It isn't even a hole, but a slit large enough for a smooth grease drain. This grill is convienent, easy to clean, and made some of the BEST hamburgers I have ever had. I definitely rate this grill with 5 Stars and recommend it to everyone. It was worth every penny!"
1,"Fits great, works lousy","I purchased this headset with the Panasonic cordless phones. I thought ""same manufacturer, it'll work great.""Wrong.The headset feels great. The mic stays close by my mouth without being intrusive, the speaker stays over my ear.You can even hear the person you're talking to.The problem is there is a loud hum that is entirely too distracting to allow.I can't use the headset. So I have thrown my money down the toilet on this one.Sad, Panasonic usually makes quality products."
2,Deserves more than 5 stars!!!,Britney's debut album offered a little of everything. She has a pop style while also having a soulful voice. I think it deserves about a hundred stars.
1,Generally useless information,"This book is generally useless, with the exception of some items of note. It is filled with contrived stories of the author's supposed physical accomplishments and stories of his encouters with people who worship and admire him. In addition, his method of insulting other workout methods will turn the reader off quicker than you can say, ""condescending."" I recommend Mark DeLisle's Master Level Fitness books instead of this book. Mark's books are more to the point, no nonsense, and have easy to follow workout plans to lead one to wherever they wish to go. John Peterson's book seems to have been written simply to pay homage to his favorite person; John Peterson."
1,Instant waste of money,I purchased Instant Architect because it was cheap & boy did I get what I paid for. It doesn't do any kind of 3d views & it's very difficult to use. Unless you want to spend many many hours trying to learn this software I would suggest you save your money & buy something better.
1,Fantasies,"There is no doubt that Christ suffered, but there is absolutely no biblical or historical evidence for much of the content of this film. Impressive visuals and sound cannot change the fact that this effort is overloaded not with historical truths, but with Gibson's fantasies. Of course he has the right to display his version of events, but the rest of us need not be fooled."
1,What?!?!?!,I've listned to this album and theres absolutely nothing special about it whatever. At times the album gets a little more progreessive in the occasional song but besides thoses rare moments this cd is horrible! I highly recommend you do not buy this cd. I've heard this cd called progressive metal and hard rock. What what are you people smoking this is like space emo crap!!!!! 0 STARS
2,A decent meter for the money.,"Basically I am a huge Fluke fan and have several of their products. I felt this was a decent meter for the money, a quality product. The probes detach at times when you pull them from their holders so that can be a pain but all around a good product. The holder should come with the meter which it did not from this vendor. For an everyday first response meter considering the money it does the job. Nuff said."
2,Stuff I never even thought about...,"Grew up as the atonal curmudgeon in a thoroughly musical household -- my mother got her BA in music at age 70 and still teaches piano at age 80 -- but Carhart walks one through the ""quartier musique"" in such a fashion that even I thoroughly enjoyed the stroll. His rediscovery of the piano begins with his own story but fear not, the book moves briskly away from the personal and captures the reader's attention and interest as Carhart writes of the wonderful complexity of this commonplace thing: the piano. The descriptions of the master classes and the visit to the Fazioli piano factory are brilliant concluding pieces to this very well-crafted volume. In essence the book embodies much of what Carhart has to tell us about the piano. As well he treats Paris and the French with due consideration and appreciation and never condescends to his reader. A delightful read that gains momentum."
1,Bad to the bone,"One major character is blinded, but continues to shoot up the place. I would have better spent my time by closing my eyes and resting up. Watch anything but this waste of time and talent."
1,hated it!,"She uses celebrities extensively as examples of what she's explaining. There is a brief explanation of a concept followed by paragraphs of celebrities who fit. If you took out all of the celebrity references, this book would be about 30 pages long. If you aren't familiar with the major aspects of the personalities of movie stars and politicians, it's more confusing than helpful."
1,Not a great bike,"I was distracted by the brand name of this bike, but in actuality it was not a great purchase. The quality was just not great and it was quite heavy. I think Kettler do better with their trikes and scooters."
1,Could be a great product if it worked,The first unit that I received was replaced by HP Technical Support because it froze and required a reset almost daily. My second unit turns itself on for a reminder and never shuts off causing the battery to completely drain and erase all of my information and settings. HP Tech Support attempted to blame 3rd party applications for my trouble but I haven't even installed any Microsoft software. I am hanging in there with high hopes for the new version of Pocket PC.
2,The Paradigm of Grammars,"I obtained the 1965 edition of this grammar in a used bookstore for a few dollars several years ago and have consulted it time and again. Its import is reflected in its going price on Amazon, ($550+). Its value is in its simplicity, logical arrangement, and expositional clarity, three characteristics of any good piece of writing or any textbook that is worth the use. The current-day textbooks of most any kind appear to have an underlying philosophy that the more hodge-podge on the page, the better. You open them and your eyes are greeted with an aesthetic disaster, a confusing layout, and impenetrable inarticulateness.Not so with Warriner's grammar. Based on customer images, the newer editions have kept the quality of the old. If so, this edition should be as extremely satisfying as the one on my shelf."
2,My Favorite Singer,"I started listening to John Gary in the mid 60's. My favorite album was ""A Little Bit of Heaven"". I would love to get a copy of this. My record was broken. If you can reproduce this album I would love it. If anyone has it please notify me how I could get it. tommolloy@hotmail.com"
2,An awe-inspiring disc!,"This CD was absolutely incredible! Corigliano's music bristles with energy and at the same time can still to a very beautiful calm. The piano concerto is exactly like this. It is one of the most phisically and emotionally exciting pieces of music that I have ever heard. The work is mostly atonal, but there are some very nice tonal sections in the piece. The third movement is proof of that. I do not usually go for atonal pieces, but the piano concerto is one of the best that I have ever heard. The last minute-and-a-half of the final movement is absolutely astounding; it's jaw-dropping! The other pieces on this CD were excellent too. I especially liked Tournaments. And Corigliano's orchestrations are some of the best I've ever heard! So, if your looking for some great, approachable modern music, I can't recommend this disc enough!"
2,read it,This is a example of excellent discpline for one's life. My whole sales team is reading this book. Must read for everyone and all walks of life.
1,Arrived broken,"My product arrived broken. I was so excited to receive it and heard the dvds and plastic pieces loose inside the box. There are scratches on the DVD and the plastic box has broken pieces. What kind of person packs a DVD set into a white plastic envelope with absolutely no protection and expects it to ship in one piece? I'm extremely disappointed. Not only that, the first season I bought from Amazon came in a small box, in one piece."
2,Hilarious!,"This is so funny. The acting is [bad], but adds to hilarity (is that even a word?) to this gory little flick. Yes it's a stupid movie, but it's funny and that is all that counts. The plot is almost too simplistic to be called that: The New Zealand government's bumbling four man anti-alien department, the Astro-Investigation and Defense Service, stumbles onto the wholesale slaughter of the small town of Kaihoro by an alien horde. And not just any aliens -- capitalist aliens! Alien entrepreneurs! Interstellar bastards who plan to promote human flesh as the latest fast-food taste sensation, under the banner of Crumm's Crunchy Delights! It's hysterical. If you get scared by seeing gore (I don't know why you would be) then stay away from this film, but for us normal people that don't follow the crowd, let's all give a big hollar out to Peter Jackson!"
2,Toronot City Map,"Map was very helpful in a recent trip to Toronto, Canada...Easy to cary in pocket or a backpack and is produced to be durable."
2,Hurt .. not Hurtful to the Ears,"A very unique band that has great writing, great playing, and is a great listen for whatever mood a person may be in."
2,GCB,"GCB is the best new series! Well written and well cast.I am extremely dissappointed that ABC canceled this gem of a show.I truly hope that all the fan support for this show will mean a reversal of their decision and give the GCB another season.In my oppinion, an earlier time slot would help.I would like to see ABC keep Revenge on Wednesday nights and put GCB in the 9:00 pm Sunday night slot."
2,Great value,"I bought this for my Naruto-obsessed 9 year-old. He wears it constantly. One of the studs came loose the first night he had it, but he still wears it."
2,The Best Deep Fringe Antenna,For you guys worried about this antenna not being able to withstand the elements. I can tell you that mine has been up for three years in the NE and we get plenty of bad weather here and it has held up fantastically. I get signals from three states with this antenna from 60 miles away no problem.
1,album: miami,"i have been touch for two songs!!: summer guest ,and over the edge...there are pretty cool!!.The composer is Belgian and his music is esasy to listen...;i wouldn t buy this cd for two songsof course!!but this is my point of view,by the way i hate postal service.peace and love!"
1,Possibly one of the worst games i have played,"week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game..take my advice dont even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i dont think they'll care it's so bad"
2,Delicious recipes,We bought this book wanting to replicate 'California' style cooking that we tasted while traveling. The recipes rely on fresh fruit and vegetables and are fun to experiment with. The peach-nectarine-apricot pie is wonderful.
2,THIS IS SO GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I totally love this game. The story of this game is excellent. The fighting scenes are very fun.It is a little hard but still great fun. The graphics are great too. The length of this is very long which makes it great because you don't finish it in like, one day."
2,Excellently written,This book was excellent! The research that went into it is fabulous. I enjoyed every page and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Doc Holliday's motivation for the legend he became.
1,Voices are all wrong.,Why couldn't they get the real voice cast to do it? The joker's voice in particular is just awful.
1,Not even worth a dime,"I own this for about 6 months, I try to use it on a daily basis. I've found it in accurate, always off. I usually end off doing the little holes trick."
2,wonderful!,This is a fantastic show! I really did not think that I would like Downton Abbey but it just sucks you in! I can't wait to watch the third season! All you have to do is watch the first one or two episodes and you will be hooked!
1,"Annoying device, button won't click consistently","The one I got was defective; I have to hit the left mouse button multiple times to get it to work, and at an odd angle to get the button to click. It is continuously annoying. I hope other folks have better success with theirs. I wish I could exchange mine, but this probably does not warrant an exchange."
2,Great for hot rollers,I use this before setting my hair and it adds a nice hold. Definitly gives you more control and hold without being sticky.
1,It should be illegal to release movies this bad,"Absolutely the worst, homemade, most God-awful movie you'll ever waste time watching. It was in theatres for about 2 days, which was bout 47 hours and 45 minutes too long... I'm a big fan of independent films but this was worse than any homemade college movie I've ever seen! Save yourself!!!"
2,Berry Fun Game!,"Super cute game for anyone whose a fan of Strawberry Shortcake! It's exactly like ""Strawberry Shortcake Princess Hide and Seek"", but with different pictures to find. We have MANY games and this is the one my 3 year old will get out first. We play this EVERY day and she never gets tired of it. The pieces are study and good quality. I love the pictures and I even have fun playing with it, although I usually limit it to 3 games of Strawberry Shortcake a day (I do get tired of it eventually!)"
2,"Classy, lightweight","Very nice-looking and functional opera glasses with a bit of power packed inside. Bought these for my 96-year-old mom who just loves using them to keep up-to-date with the world around her. Lighter than typical binoculars and comes with carrying strap and soft case. Ordered these for Christmas about two weeks prior and the company had them at the door in less than a week. Great gift, good price, super service."
1,Very disappointed,I am very disappointed in this lunch bag. I bought it for my daughter and after only one month of school it has molded between the outside and the insulation inside. I will never purchase another product from sugarbooger again!!!
2,"super fast delivery, excellent quality",I was very impressed with this seller. I got my order with in 2 days. The product quality was very good and it was sold for the least price I can ever imagine.I strongly recommend this seller if you wanna buy anything.Phanidhar
2,"Justice League season 1 good,","Well this is what fanboys and friends have been waiting forsince X-men went off the air.Great animation and stories that are funto watch.This set contains four discs and 26 episodes of adventure that are sure to please.Featuring :Superman, Batman, Wonderwoman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, the Flash, and Hawkgirl which make up this version of Justice League.A must have for your collection!"
2,Quiet please,I travel extensively by plane and these headphones allow me to escape the chaos of air travel. The sound is amazing and it feels like you are in a concert. No more crying babies and chatty seat mates. I highly recommend these.
2,Very Moving,"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1850 after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed. Stowe was very well aware of the plight of these people and she wanted to make a change. She wanted to make her feelings about the evils of slavery known to the public. She wouldn't allow people to ignore the tragedies surrounding them because it was socially acceptable at the time. Although this novel is a work of fiction it accurately displays the lives of American slaves in the 1800's. In fact, the main character, Uncle Tom, is based upon the autobiography of Josiah Henson, and other slave narratives. She also appeals to the reader through emotional pulls that are easy to identify with, as if you were experiencing what the characters were. In all, I enjoyed reading this book and I think that Stowe created a very impressive message that is still important for us to look at today."
2,Nickel Creek is NOT bluegrass!!,"Nickel Creek are an acoustic band, not bluegrass. While they do have plenty of bluegrass elements in their music, this is not the genre that they belong to. For those who buy this expecting to hear 'Bela Fleck' or 'Alison Kraus and Union Station', you may be left scratching your head.This album is darn near perfect. I would actually give it a strong 4.5 stars. It's better than ""This Side"", and possibly even better than the debut album, although both of those records are brilliant as well. Nickel Creek are always finding new ways to play their instruments to produce tracks that are built upon the familiar NC sound, yet give it a new twist to make it sound unique. Sarah's voice is angelic; I wish she sang more. Overall just a superb effort, and one that will stay in rotation for quite awhile."
1,It was just ok.,"I think this movie could have been so much better. Some of the characters were much more interesting than the two main characters and it tended to drag on. If you don't have much going on and want something to watch while you are doing something else this movie is fine. You won't miss anything by having your focus elsewhere. But if you are looking for something to sit down and really watch, keep looking elsewhere."
1,This doll sucks!!,"This doll has a big head and she is very ugly don't ever ever never ever ever buy this doll it is a piece of junk,if you put it in the bath there will be brown stuff coming out of her head I'm serious put her in the bathtub and see yourself and they copy myscenes i say buy a my scene instead.Hope this helps"
2,a wonderful eye opener into an incredible culture,"I enjoyed this book emensely. Some may call it ""flowery"", or too much like a fairy tale, but I couldn't disagree more. The author writes gracefully, and simply enough to carry you through without rereading difficult passages, but at the same time is thought provoking. You will fall in love with Sayuri, for her character is one we can all in some way relate too. True, it was difficult for someone who knew nothing about the life of a geisha beforehand to understand everything, but that only made me want to learn more-like any good book should. I definitely recommend to anyone, from as picky a reader as any!"
1,The Constant Gardener,"We found this movie too long for the story line. It was a typical who done it. It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying. Overall, boring."
1,Keeps going downhill,"I have read every book in the series, and despite the fact I was not thrilled with the 4th book, I was excited to see the 5th one had come out. Unfortunately, as far as the series go, I feel the first one was wonderful, the second ok, the third excellent, and the fourth and fifth nothing to write home about. Auel needs to get herself a good editor to tighten up her work. There is a good novel in here somewhere, she just needs some help to find it. She also needs to remember that what made the first book so special is that Ayla was human. She's become such a superwoman I sometimes just find myself shaking my head.I'll read the 6th one when it comes out, it is as if I can't help myself. But here's to hoping Auel recovers the magic she seems to have lost."
2,"A phenominal book for math shortcuts, and basics","I was given this book when I was a freshman in High School. I must say it really opened my eyes to the FUN you can have with math. NO, I was not a bookworm, or the teachers pet. This book made math so easy and fast, that I amazed many of my teachers with the skill it gave me. I was able to perfrom in seconds what it took my teachers many times longer to accomplish. Over the years, I have wished I still had the hardbound copy to refer to and to use in helping my daughter get the GRIP on math that all school aged children should have. I would like to see it used as a tool for learning in our schools. Of all the books I have come across, this one is a particular favorite of mine. I am going to have to order a copy for my daughter who is in college now, but has heard me talk about this book for years.I still find myself working problems with the methods this book taught me."
1,Not very effective,"I bought this last year. I use it indoors to catch mosquitos that have gotten in the house. Over the last two years, it has caught about 3 mosquitos. This year, it hasn't caught anything. The fan is not strong enough to really suck mosquitos in and keep them in the trap when the flap is fully open. I would not recommend this product."
1,L is more like an XL,the mountain's shirt sizes are not accurate but their artwork is amazing. 8 more words required to post this review
1,Horrible,Loved the design to these. After a short period of time they were all scratched. Pfaltzgraff sent a cleaner that was suppose to remove the scratches and it didn't work.
1,Not very good.,"I don't know how many times I can listen to this guy ask ""If you don't use your thoughts, memories, emotions, associations, or perceptions, how do you experience X"". I don't know what this question is supposed to do for you or why he thinks that asking it over and over for different experiences does anything for anyone."
2,Love it,"My wife absolutely loves this product! As a Cubs fan, I Love to see here wearing it! Proudly sporting our colors!"
1,Misses the mark,"It seems that Miss Brady laments the fact that she's single a lot more than the fact that she's not having children. Although it is VERY sad for her that the opportunity never arose to marry and procreate, it was quite tedious to read paragraph after paragraph of self-pity. Only after she reached menopause age did she make peace with her childlessness. As someone who is childfree by choice, I purchased this book hoping it would somehow ""affirm my womanhood."" It didn't. Unfortunately, Miss Brady narrowly speaks to single women without children, which of course, is her experience. Those who are unable to have children or have chosen not to would do better reading something more specifically targeted to their situations."
2,it blew my mind!,"insipite of being the youngest backstreetboy... Nick has proven himself on this album.. it was a truly persnal album that would describe the way he feels.. he has a variety of songs like from a balld "" do i have to cry for you"" to a mid tempo 80'ish song like "" is it saturday yet... and a rock infulence.. .. i recommend this album to everyone who likes variety!Nick did a great job!"
2,Classic George Winston...too short a visit,"This is about as laid-back as one can get with New Age music. I have all of his other CDs and have seen him in concert several times. This CD has the classic George Winston sound. I was a bit disappointed that the CD was less than 30 minutes long (29.08 min). I would have liked a longer visit with him. A very relaxing, but sad feel to the music....like a Remembrance.."
1,A decent account of life at the CIA,"I graduated from the CIA and respected this author's attempt at explaining what a unique place it is. Keep in mind that he did not endure the entire program, but he gives an accurate account of his experience. I really enjoyed his detailed explanation of the cirriculum- there's a lot to learn- and his profiles of the chefs who create chefs. You must read this book if you are even considering this profession."
2,Excellent resource for teaching and research,"Great stuff. McIver neatly reviews anti-evolution (in the broadest sense) before and after Darwin. Thought provoking in that is shows the mental tricks critics will turn to avoid contradicting the Genesis account and agreeing with Darwin.It's a shame the revised edition wasn't updated. Still, highly useful.As an aside, it's highly unlikely that the comment above attributed to McIver is true. McIver comes across as one who _always_ belived in evolution (see, for example, his articles in ""Creation/Evolution"" and ""Skeptic"") ... methinks I smell a hoax."
2,The Argent part of the twofer,"The Argent album part of the twofer is an excellent continuation of the Zombies for keyboardist and main driving force, Rod Argent. The sound is basically the same and Rod Argent shares songwriting with guitarist Russ Ballard. These songs are incredibly well-crafted with great melodies. Liar (by guitarist Ballard, is the same song 3 Dog Night had a hit with and pretty much copied note for note), Like Honey, Schoolgirl, Be Free,and Dance in the Smoke could have all been singles. Great vocals and harmonies with a Zombies-type vibe make this worth the price of twofer alone. If you really liked the zombies Tell Her No, She's Not There, or Time of the Season, you will love this."
2,oooooohhhhh yeah,"Nah, I think I would have to say that this book IS falling down funny, in fact I've never laughed so much. Burroughs, Thompson, I hear people compare Mark Leyner to so many beat or other post-modern writers, but I guarantee you that you will NEVER read something quite like this. I ended up reading at least half the book aloud to my roommate while tears were falling down my face from my fits of laughter. It may not be for everyone, but it is surely for anyone like myself that likes their humor fast, random, and fantastically absurd."
1,I really tried!,"I really tried. But having read it twice, I cannot escape the conclusion that, to me, it is a pretentious book. It tempts us in many places with hints of something deeper. Following his pointers, and doing his exercises, I found a few nice quotables, but otherwise not much. Certainly not the promised bounty.At least it's short."
2,The work of a genius! Borrow this CD if you don't buy it.,"Everyone should hear this CD at least once. I am amazed every time I hear it and think how a young man like him could convey so many life experiences in a short span of time. Who was 2Pac really? He must have known he was exiting this world, probably to return in some other form - but exactly how, no one is sure. When it happens we'll all know it. One last thing, to call this CD west coast or gangsta rap doesn't seem to do it justice. Somehow it rises above all that and all you can picture in your head is one very serious individual that some people may not want to come back."
2,EXCELENTE,"patricia barber ha sido para mi un reciente y delicioso hallazgo. La conjuncion de su voz con la seleccion de las canciones de este album lo convierten en una joyita imperdible, para quienes aun gustan de una musica sin estrindencias inutiles. Para escuchar una y otra vez"
2,F-ing funny as can f-ing be,"This movie was what I had hoped for and a lot more; a silly, raunchy, vulgar, and profane bit of Jack Black driven insanity that makes you laugh and laugh hard. The f-bombs drop continuously as if there was a quota that needed to be reached and you end up laughing just at the pure ridiculousness of it all. In addition, the songs are so bloody hilarious that I dare you not to find yourself repeating them, vulgarities and all, as you go about your life in the days to follow. Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters/Nirvana shows up in an excellent cameo as Satan but it's the priceless scene just before that one that really had me howling. It's the little voice that lives inside of you...This is the kind of movie you watch for the pure pig in mud joy of it. I've already rolled in it a half dozen times and have enjoyed every moment.As for the extras, there are fourteen deleted/extended scenes, featurettes, music videos and more."
1,Great movie horrible condition!,"I ordered this movie as a birthday present for my sister who used to love it as a kid. The case was cracked and the disc would not stay clicked in, was completely scratched before i even opened the case! i was so Embarrassed to give that to her after i opened the box to see that. At that point it was too late to replace considering they do not carry it in stores but i am very disappointed."
2,Absolutely PRICELESS!,"What a gem of a little movie - something here for everyone. I LOVED IT!!!! One of those times where you just know you will watch a movie over and over again and never really catch it all - fresh every time. It hit me like a ton of bricks! Vive la France, and cowboy, indian, horse and his ladylove too!"
1,Review of Chi Running,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
2,Garage Storage,I purchased three of these units last fall for my garage makeover and paid only 49.99 each at Aldi's grocery stores.
2,"Wonderful TV, overpriced at Amazon","I recently purchased this TV for my bedroom. It is a good size without being overwhelming, delivers a crisp and sharp picture, and looks great. Plus I love love love the built in DVD player! My single complaint is that it takes an awfully long time to turn on after you hit the power button... Small complaint I know, but that's all I can gripe about it!BTW, Amazon's price seems awfully high... I just paid fivehundred even and shipping from Costco/Sam's Club. This includes an extra 2 year warranty. Much better buy if you ask me."
2,love the removable parts,"Wonderful coffee pot I love the removable parts, the bucket lifts out for easy no mess water filling. The basket lifts out easy to toss grounds. Makes great coffee. I definately think its the best coffee maker I've ever had, love the auto timer too."
1,wrong casing for lamp,"I bought this lamp by the application for a particular sony 60 xbr tv when i got the lamp installed it and did not work, after installation called tv repair man and he pointed out the lamp was not original sony and showed me that lamp was installed in casing which had different connector when plug in the tv would not make contacts so he had to use the lamp with different original casing by transfering the lamp in the old casing cost me $200.00 for service call If I would have bought this product from sony directly I would pay 60 more dollars but I could have installed myself and tv would work very disappointed with product sold as original sony equipment priduct"
2,A MUST BUY,"It is a one of my favorite cd's at this time. So, manygreat song: ""That's why Godis singing the blues"",""Pictureof home"", ""Wring that neck""and meny more. The band sounds better than ever"
2,"What version is the real one? Not this one, for sure.","That's strange! I've seen recently RICH AND FAMOUS on TCM Channel and it was the full version. The scene on the plane between Jacqueline Bisset and Michael Brandon was complete, and the nude scene between Matt Lattanzi and Bisset in the hotel room was also showed as it was filmed originally. How can it be that the DVD version is severely butchered and the cable show is not? Let`s hope that the film will be released on DVD in the future on its uncut version. I`ll wait till then."
2,"fun, funny, easy read",really enjoyed reading this book as my son was hiking the AT. I was able to relate to the terrain and what he was experiencing when he would call me for his next shipments of food. Very entertaining and funny!
1,Assembly problems,"Holes were misaligned by over 2 inches on one side and nearly an inch on the foot section. Ordered another, hoping it was just a bad batch. Wood and fabrics were nice and the painted sign and clock were attractive."
2,Let's put this in a simple way to review it,"MegaMan was a good NES game, but people seem to overlook it. The sequel, on the other hand, grew BIG.The MegaMan series is known for its amazing graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics, precise controls, and frustrating difficulty. MegaMan 2 has all that.You choose from 8 different robot masters, selecting your own order of levels.The level designs are as creative as ever. However, they are also very hard. Luckily, killing certain enemies might give you an orb to restore your health. Or better yet, if you're lucky enough, a 1up! Unfortunately, that won't save you from having to go through Heat Man's puzzling disappearing blocks.Dr. Wily's stage is a total pain in the neck, too. Deathtraps are set here and there.But still, MegaMan 2 is one the best and most frustrating NES games ever. If you are a fan or looking for a challenge, then you should buy this."
2,Action and Adventure,Acting: A+Action: A+Plot: A+Ending: BSex Scenes: NoneLanguage: NonwViolence: A+ and alot of itWorth a rental or Purchase: A+Hope you enjoy the movie. Love this Spidey way better than Tobey Mcguire
1,Misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book was NOT written by Robert A. Heinlein! It is a book about prostitution written by a former prostitute. I found out the hard way by buying this book. Do not buy this book. It is NOT written by Robert A. Heinlein.
2,a must read,"if you've ever been serious about bringing out the genius within, you must get this book! The approach is not only innovative but effective. The image streaming and borrowed genius techniques are excellent and deceptively simple. It doesn't take long before you begin to realize the effects of this book. I'm a student in university now and this book has had a tremendous effect on my learning...especially my perceptive abilities. I recommend this book to everyone, at any age."
1,Very difficult to read,"I thought I'd be reading profound philosophical insights, but it's more of a religious cult kind of thing. I don't recommend it to anyone except hard core Eastern though people."
2,Early American Rebel,"I was looking for a soldier's account of the Revolutionary War and came across this rare memoir in the Jamestown, Virgina Nationa Park Service bookstore. I sure was glad I did.I have read many soldier's memiors from from all periods of time but never during the Revolutionary War. We have heard about the sufferings of our country's first soldiers but Martin tells us like it was as he lived it. There is not a lot of battle descriptions but he is a master story teller who will take you back in time to the days of the colonies and George Washington's army during America's struggle for independence.If you love good personal history narratives and want to learn about the Revolutionary War then get this book. This would be an excellent book for classroom study or home school."
2,And in the end...,"This is the Beatles masterpiece. Okay, it's one of several masterpieces by the Beatles. This particular album is their last masterpiece. I don't need to say much about it, because it has been written about extensively already. But I will say that it more than lives up to the hype surrounding it, and you should buy it unless you are one of the few people who hate the Beatles."
2,Keyspan Presentation Tool,I am a very avid technology user and science teacher. My students are involved with many professional presentations and I am a lead teacher and mentor for many proffessional teacher groups. My students and I believe this is the easiest preentation tool we have found. It is rock solid. I beieve in Apple computers and this is the only presentation tool that works with Apple products right out of the box. I have purchased three of these gems. Two were used by first year teachers without any training.Best buy in a presentation tool.
1,broke first time i tried to use it,"First I discovered that my watch was too thin for the tool to work. There is a screw that moves the platform up and down, but the highest setting was too low. I compensated by putting a piece of cardboard under the watch band and it lined up perfectly. As I tried to remove the pin (and it started to come out), the entire link remover broke in half. This tool was a waste of money!!!!"
1,Disgusting.....,"This book is horrendous! Developmentally speaking, babies need to eat more than 4 times per day, this includes night feedings. Expecting your baby to suffer just so you can get some sleep is purely selfish. You shouldn't have had a baby in the first place if sleep is SOOOOO important to you that you'd be a neglectful parent. Sleeping through the night isn't worth putting your baby through this misery!Read some REAL books that don't glorify child abuse and neglect. This is dangerous advice to follow and I certainly wish I could have rated this with zero stars!"
2,It's Pretty Good But...,"Majority of this CD is great, but there are those certain songs that are either annoying or just plain boring and have to many sounds going on at once. Not that I have a problem with layered songs, it's the sounds that she'll use.The songs that I do not like are:""Tippy Toe,"" personally, there are two reasons for not liking this song. First off, the chorus is much to high and annoying. Second, the song is about an affair and she is the other woman. The whole song is about sneaking behind one's back.""Wonder 'Bout,"" I just find it boring. No real surprises in the song.""About Me,"" This song has such potential but is completely ruined. It seems as if it's going to build up to this amazing chorus, then it drops and is very...boring.But all in all, the CD is worth the purchase. I listen to it over and over."
1,"Good Ideas, Bad Choices","The story starts well, and drags you in, you can't help but start to like the characters. Among other reasons, thats why I had such a hard time with this story. I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief. There are several parts of this book where as I was reading I simply had to say, huh?The overall romance and story is enjoyable enough. I simply wish the author could have changed a few minor plots, and perhaps removed or altered a few scenes to make the story more believable."
2,books,Was very happy with the book. James Patterson is never a disappointment. Amazon was very prompt in getting my order out quickly and I knew that Amazon would be the place to go to order the book.
2,Interesting Science Fiction,"The fate of the world rests with a group of young scientists who must help 'jump start' a dying sun. When their mission is diverted by a distress call from the first spaceship that disappeared in its first attempt at the same objective, this sci/fi turns into a suspense/thriller. No only is their mission now in jeopardy, but their lives as well!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,You're... you're kidding right?,"Oh jeez... just what we need. Another ""X popular show/game/movie/book"" is going to RUIN AMERICAN CHILDREN!I wonder just how many parents bought into this bull when Power Rangers was still a big deal..."
1,Operational Review,"Everything on the unit works well except the digital display. The display lights up but shows no information. With that, there is no way to use the radio, clock, or timer functions. I will be returning this unit for replacement. Installation, mounting, and manual were understandable and straight forward. Mounting template was accurate. Includes manuals and templates in 3 languages. Includes all hardware needed for installation, batteries for the remote, and extension mounts for cabinets with a non-flush cabinet bottom. Does not include RG-6 COAX or RGB cables. Does include FM antenna. Has one 90deg RG-6 adaptor for sharp turns. Unit is silver."
1,Cute but cheaply made,"I bought this for my eight year old daughter and when we got it home noticed it was very cheaply made. The petticoat underneath the dress is a separate piece, and it's made out of construction paper (no joke) with the orange tulle attached. The petticoat wouldnt fit under the dress either. The dress was cute, but the hat and petticoat were pretty shabbily made. We returned this item to the store the very next day, disappointed."
2,Daughter loves it,"Our daughter loves playing with this and the other foxes and wolves that she received as a gift, made by Schleich."
1,"Flashes of the Naked Gun team, otherwise...eh","I saw the first SCARY MOVIE and couldn't believe how heinously unfunny it was.""Okay, in this scene, the girl jumps up in the air and freezes--just like in THE MATRIX.""That's pretty much the pattern of humor for that whole movie: make endless references to other (better) movies. No real jokes, just references.I saw SCARY MOVIE 3 only because I noticed that some of the writers and director had been involved in the NAKED GUN films. I laughed a couple times, but a lot of this felt like the first film (I never bothered to see the second). I really wished they would've left Michael Jackson out of the preview because that scene could've provided one of the bigger laughs--if I hadn't already saw it fifty times in the commercial.I could understand fusing THE RING and SIGNS, but tossing in the Eminem movie parody felt meandering and knocked the movie off-balance--especially since it had nothing to do with the second half of the film."
1,Short Range,"I was very excited to get this phone when I switched to VOIP (Vonage). Since VOIP only gives you one jack, I wanted a phone with long range that wouldn't interfere with my wireless network. I've had this phone for three months and am very disappointed. The phone works great within 50' of the base, but has big problems beyond that. I installed the base in my home office, but had no reception in my BR at the other end of the house. My house is a 2000 square feet ranch with the kitchen in the middle. I ran a phone wire from my VOIP modem to my kitchen to have the base in a central location. Even from here I cannot get good reception in my BR which is now only 52 feet away. There are two rooms in between, one bedroom and one bathroom. I made sure that no appliances are obstructing the signal. I wish the base had an external antenna to extend the range."
2,To short,The handle isn't long enough for me to reach across my Jeep Liberty. Why not add another foot to the length?
2,A reflection of '99 in live music,"Of the 3 WBCN albums this is heavier and has more live concert performances- it reflects '99 well with songs by Korn, Limp B, 311, Blink 182, Kid Rock, Moby, and Everlast. The performances are more live shows vs. live studio like the other albums. There's not as much depth or complexity unearthed in the songs, but you get more raw energy- very different than Naked 1&2, but still good"
2,refreshing view of the complicated situation,this book provides new and important information about the Maoist/royal struggle and offers a view and honesty not found in mainstream media. it is up to date and should definately be read by those truly interested in the actual state of living in Nepal at the moment.
1,Fake and farfetched,"Roth is still a great prose stylist. And the passages on Newark were brilliant. But for a historical novel, the history is way off. The radicalism is cartoonish or worse. Other writers have tackled this fascinating subject (the 60's radicals and what became of them) and done a much better job - Marge Piercy, for one."
1,"It's ""ukulele"" NOT ""ukelele""","I agree with the other reviews so I won't duplicate that. The author really should've gotten his facts -- and spelling -- right before publishing. He had a great opportunity to put out a good and useful product, but he blew it. I was thinking maybe it's better than nothing, but no, I'd rather have nothing. Thank goodness there are more things available now. If the author just wanted a book with pretty pictures he should have done that and left out his ""history."" It's better to give no information than bad information."
1,bad business,"i bought this book brand new from amazon.com an within 3 days of class 8 pages fell out the front of book !! i dont know if its amazon or a poor publisher but this is rediculous !!! now the front pages fell out 3 weeks ago but just last night while i was looking up a definition in the glossary more pages are falling out the back of the book !! danm !! i took the plastic off this book, it was new an now its falling apart ! this has never happend before with me but i dont know what to do ! i need the book for class but its falling apart ! i should get a new book from amazon! IF U KNOW WHERE I CAN EMAIL THIS PROBLEM TO GET RESULTS PLEASE E-MAIL ME !!! gdelelli@student.southgatech.com !!!sincerely gerard delellis jr"
2,Franklin Men's Carbon Fiber II Batting Glove,"The article is an excellent, good presentation and I expect it he is resistant and strong"
1,poor voice quality results,The voice quality deteriorates as a result of using this case cover on my iPhone. I am not satisfied with the purchase.
1,This movie was terrible!,"This movie looked pretty good in the previews, but believe me, it was bad! The story line was one of the worst I've ever seen, the characters were totally unbelievable and it wasn't even scarry, not at all. It was slow getting started, the ending was so dumb (oh, I just it him, he must be dead, so I'll just turn my back to him now) and the rest was sooooooo predictable.The only thing remotley good was the special effects, they were pretty amazing.But over all, save yourself, get something else."
2,Great selection of 9 inch blocks,"This book has a great variety of 9 1/2"" blocks (9 inch finished). If you wanted to make a block a different size you'd have to redraft it. Many beginning and intermediate piecing classes teach students to make a sampler from 9"" blocks. This book is a natural next step to continue adding to one's repertoire without having to experiment with too-tiny pieces. An excellent book for different sized blocks is ""Around the Block with Judy Hopkins"". I found it to be a good companion to ""Block Party""."
1,Worst product ever. Too many positive Amazon reviews,"Unsafe product. Yes, its manual, but it's not smooth. You're too busy hanging on for dear life rather than enjoying your treadmill experience. The frame is too small and rickety for such use (the hanging on for dear life part).If it was smoother, the work out WOULD be worth it since its naturally on an incline and it makes you work it. But, its not worth risking your safety over. Just buy a power driven model so you don't have to wonder if you're going to trip and break a leg.Its so dangerous that I refused to give it away. I just disassembled it and tossed it out on separate trash days to avoid someone from adopting it for themselves."
2,"Fine for updates, slow for transfers","I originally bought three of these for our HD boxes, and they improved the connection with TiVo service for updates significantly. Transfers between boxes were slow, though. If we tried to watch while transferrring, unless we waited until the transfer was almost finished, the program would pause when it had to wait for the rest of the transfer.One thing that helped was relocating the router next to one of the TiVo HD boxes and connecting it via Ethernet, That nearly halved the transfer times to/from that box.I later boughtActiontec MegaPlug A/V 200 Mbps Ethernet Adapterunits for all of the other boxes and now most non-HD programs transfer fast enough that we can watch them while transferring without hiccups. HD programs still require some waiting before watching. The MegaPlugs are sold in pairs but up to 12 can be combined without a separate router if you can run a PC application."
1,A limp and hurried retelling,"Read the book. The movie is terrible and only hints at the depth and beauty of the story CS Lewis wrote. I am sorely disappointed. I imagine it would be a hard story to bring to the screen, but good lord, if they can put ""Life of Pi"" on the big screen, they could do this one. The movie only vaguely recalls the plot of the book, which is so much fun to read, and the movie jumps quickly and shallowly from point to stupid point. It makes me worry that an entire generation will miss out on the book, because they won't be inspired to read it by this lazy hack job."
2,A wonderful reminder...,"These beautifully written cards allows the wisdom of the books to apply to us in an easy, daily fashion. I simply pull a card from the pack each morning and know what it is I need to focus on throughout the day. The quotes were chosen perfectly, and the calligraphy and design is simply beautiful. What a joyous way to get daily guidance!"
1,False advertisement,Hello all I normally don't complaint about my orders from Amazon but this one really upset me I was planning a pajama party for my daughter and thought having 3-d movies will be a cool item. Received my movie and comes to find out the movie wasn't in 3-d format. To make a long story short the company needs to get into details letting their customers know that the movie isn't really in 3-d.
2,A high quality movie with lots of added stuff,"Movie and sound quality was great, quite frankly with all the added storyboard and interview information added they could have just added T1 and it would've been fine for the price"
2,give it a shot,"following matt damon as the lead in a Bourne movie is a tough act to follow but Jeremy Renner does a great job in Bourne Legacy. Intense action film, good fight and chase scenes. If you like action films you will enjoy."
2,A value recording with a drawback,"A great recording and inexpesnive. The only drawback is that it lacks the ""frill"" of a libretto. So if you want to understand what is being sung in Egyptian, you're out of luck."
2,No problems,Arrived quickly with no issues. No complaints here. These are great to fill with treats or granola for sweet gifts.
1,A Stretch,"I did not read the previous book, so context was difficult to attain until I read half way through. The entire concept seemed highly implausible! l know its fiction but there has to be some foundation in reality. The whole witch thing, demons that fly, ancient worlocks? The setting was also a problem for me Florida then DC then back to Florida. Disappointed."
1,Don't try this at home folks!,"It took 3 years and sorting through numerous financial planners to overcome the mistakes i.e. advice offered by Quinn. At one time, Quinn was the #2 financial author. Well we all know what #2 stands for don't we?The advice in this book smells. Don't try it, you'll be sorry.Everybodies Money Book and Millionaire Next Door are good reads.Quinn is joke. Leave this book on the bookstores shelf where it belongs."
1,False Advertising,"this costume is awful. I ordered a small as the size chart said a small fit shih tzus which is what I have. Now, I have a shih tzu on the small size, 11 pounds (average 10-16 lbs) and this costume is far too small! It is also very poorly made and the velcro is impossible to manage. This is one costume on it's way back to Amazon"
2,True to the book,"I have been to Afghanistan three times (before the Russians invaded) and watched a number of games of buzkashi. The scenes depicted were very accurate. Also, the movie stays true to Joseph Kessel's book. This is one of only three movies I know of that are set in Afghanistan - the others being 'Caravans' (from James Michener's novel) and 'The Beast' (or ""The Beast of War') about a Russian tank crew during their occupation.'The Horsemen' is by far the best movie."
1,Not a hit with our daughter,"Stiff suspension, not bouncy at all. Might be scary for babies who are already mobile and like exploring independently. Our 9mo seemed excited at first but quickly became frightened as she realized she was tethered to a fixed spot. She's used to cruising and crawling. Wanted to encourage her to bounce by moving it for her, but it's not springy at all. She's terrified of it."
1,sad,"I have been reading Sci-Fi, (Battletech in general) for many years. And, I think that this is the poorest example of Battletech writing since 'FAR COUNTRY' which i don't consider a Battletech novel at all."
1,Countdown,"We have bought 5 pair of these headphones. They should come with a countdown timer that shows you the product's life expectancy. If you are lucky, they will fail within warranty, otherwise you can be out for close to (or maybe more than) $100 after the one year coverage period. There is no exchange or repair alternatives offered, if they break, try using them for fishing. Problems noted include: volume failure or volume reduction in one or both sides or overall deterioration of the item itself. It would be nice to have this cosmetically appealing domestic product outperform a Chinese derivative that costs less than $25, but this is not the case. Never again from this company."
1,BoRiNg!!,This game is so boring. There are no challenges and the graphics really.... They're worse than NES' graphics This game really really ...
1,obsolete,This book was written prior to relevant law changes. It would have been a good reference book 10 years ago. I was looking for something more timely.
1,Died after 2 years of use,I used it twice a month for 2 years & one day it just stopped working. The motor was still spinning but on less speed & couldn't cut anything.It's heavy & the blade gets dull relatively fast compare to other machines. I am looking for a different manufacturer or model now.
1,Useful as a doorstop,"John Hodgman is an accomplished writer and has good comedic sense and timing, so why did he release this truly awful book? I'd accuse the editor of malpractice, but there is no evidence an editor was ever involved. Maybe the joke is on us, the people who foolishly purchased this wad of paper and ink. My only consolation is I bought the paperback."
1,Buy new song on iTunes and save money,"I love Social Distortion but will not be wasting my money on this ""Greatest Hits"" collection. I think whoever came up with the albums track listing was unfamiliar with how many hits the band actually had. Maybe the band were more popular here in the Phoenix area (where they were a rock/alternative radio staple) then in other parts of the country. At minimum the track listing should have been doubled to be a greatest hits album. I was really looking forward to buying this cd and was greatly disappointed when I went to purchase it. I am sad to say that this is the first Social D album I won't be buying. Instead I will buy the 1 new single on iTunes and save my money until a real greatest hits collection or better yet a Social Distortion Anthology or Box Set is released."
1,Poor quality,The splitter worked for all of 2 minutes. Figured my HDMI cable was not in working order so I purchased another cable; did not resolve the problem. After 5 minutes of use the second flat screen lost signal from the splitter. Now I have a bulky paper weight. Great idea but very poor quality.
1,"Somewhat OK for Reference, Bad for Test Preparation","I bought these thinking that Microsoft would be in the best position to write a training kit to prepare for the certification tests, since they are, after all, Microsoft tests. Big mistake. If I hadn't used the Transcender practice tests also, I would have gotten a rude awakening at the test center. The MS books have some decent reference information, but they don't prepare you for the tests."
2,Very pleased with overall performance.,"Only problem I have is copying and printing transparencies. I am an artist and have my work photographed on 8 x 10 transparencies (chromes). I was told that this machine can copy same by simply putting a white piece of paper over the back of the transparency. IT DOES NOT WORK and I can't seem to get an answer from anyone regarding this problem. Other than the above, I am satisfied with the machine."
2,Wow,"This is really a great inflatable bed. Many people who have tried it, after parties, have loved it. If your regular bed is uncomfortable, you're gonna want to sleep in this bed instead! I bought two and told my friend, he bought two as well. The bed being raised is a big plus, it really is. Good Price!"
2,Excellent!,"I read the book, saw the movie, and thought both were great! Good Job. If you haven't read the book, I suggest doing so."
2,Cyber Power 4 Port Hub,I have had several different 4 port hubs that I have used with different laptops and found all liking in one way or the other. This hub even with out using the battery powered fecture works on all 4 ports. A good buy for the money.
2,short hand,"At first glance and at first reading, the book would seem to be a laundry list of mental functions and how they are considered in Buddhism. However, if the items are taken slowly and related to other things that one has come across in the study of Buddhist philosophy, then they are fine points to ponder and they expand one's knowledge. Definitely not a book you read like a novel."
2,Working with a Service Manual,"Any one who owns a BMW Z3 should have this book on their shelf. Whether you do your own work or not, this book is a wealth of information. Just knowing how to change some items (bulbs, fuses, etc.) in various locations on the car, will save you the cost of the book."
1,Disapointed!,"I purchased this item for a family member and give it as a Christmas gift ,little that I knew ,item did not come with all parts .What an emberasement !My advise ""when buying present open first than check if everything there than give"" .Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XLZIMA"
1,Al Franken is satan,"This is just another piece of garbage from the Democratic Bush-haters. Nothing in this book is real -- it's all lies, made up by folks who think, as the Nazis did, that if you tell lies long enough, some fool will believe it. Why anyone would publish such garbage, much less sell it to the public, is beyond me -- they must lack all character in doing so. If there were honest lawyers out there, these authors would be sued for the libel they have foisted on us. Dont' bother buying this trash!Al Franken must have been severely beaten by his parents as a child to have turned into such a miscreant adult. Someone commit him before he hurts himself."
2,Voice of My Island,"After meeting Stephen at a pub in Scotland once he finished singing, I had to buy this CD! I continue to listen to it on a regular basis, as his music brings me one step closer to the misty isle."
2,i love it,"It works great, picks up more than many others. We had a Kirby, and sold it. We bought this and minus all the hoopla the kirby had i think it is very compairable vaccuuming."
2,Touching,"This is a very touching movie. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is an awesome actor and this movie shows his talent. I won't go into the details so I won't spoil the movie. However, there are many life lessons in this film. Enjoy."
1,Could have been good,"This album is really strange. 60 something tracks...Most of which are useless sound effects which could be an intro to a song. The tracks the band actually plays in are great...for about a minute, when they abruptly stop, and resume the sound effects. The songs could be really cool, if the band would just play them. The audio sample you get is basically the whole song. I recommend not buying this."
2,"His best? No, but certainly important.","The music's good, not great, and is a portrait of the artist as a young man, at first with his high school friend Violet Santangelo and later on his own, recording demos for others. (The Motorcycle Abilene's ""Ride So High"" is worth the price of admission alone.)Realize this- most (if not all) of this was recorded before Zevon was 22. How great can he be expected to be? He's good, if I want to hear his greatness, I'll put on ""Life'll Kill Ya"", ""Transverse City"" or ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" (or any album for that matter released between 1976 and 2003).I'm not sure about the importance of the last two Zevon-free numbers, as I'm sure nobody who buys this buys it for Violet Santangelo, even if she harmonizes beautifully with Warren. But the twelve tracks with the Excitable Boy are essential for tracing his history."
1,Uninteresting,I found the film uninteresting. The animation is what really got me. If the plan was to go ahead with the movie I'd say get graphics like the Watchmen or 300 had or get real people. I couldn't get past the animation even for a beginner it would be better as a free movie than going to screen.
1,A story with an agenda,"The book contains a large body of information on church music, but it is often accompanied by statements reflecting the writer's personal opinion, unsupported by the material presented. He derives his final conclusion about what ""good"" worship music is from his subjective evaluation of music history, rather than from objective scriptural exegesis."
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in the 512MB Cruzer Micro 2 I purchased recently. The Launch Pad system sucks. There is no way to disable it. Every computer I tried automatically installs the stupid Launch Pad that takes too long to install. It will crash some computers running windows 2000 and XP. It loads from a protected drive that is read only with no way to delete it. I lose 33 MB out of the 512 MB to this program. I paid for 512 MB not 479 MB. I only hope I can return it. I will not consider buying SanDisk products again.
2,I love this juicer!,I did quite a bit of research before buying this juicer and I am happy that I did. This juicer works wonderfully! I juice a lot of carrots and apples - hard veggies and fruits - and I could not be happier with the results! I would definitely recommend this juicer to anyone who wants a good solid juicer for a reasonbale price.
2,Catchy and worth owning,"I've had the CD for about a year, and her vocals are amazing. Check out the hidden acoustic version of ""Burn"", it'll sing to your soul. That track is worth purchasing the entire thing alone."
2,Lights Out,"I feel that Lil' Wayne's second solo project is by far a whole lot better than first one, ""Tha Block Is Hot"". He and the Cash Money Millionaires did an exceptional job on the beats because they truly thump in your CD player. Lil' Wayne raps from the bottom of his heart especially when he pays tribute to his father. If you're like me and you consider yourself a true fan of CMB, go pick up Lil' Wayne's ""Lights Out""."
2,Excellent resource for how to take the test,"If you are looking for a last minute study session, this is not the place to turn. They give you excellent advice on how the test is scored and methods of marking answers but there are few passages in it. They do provide an excellent list of authors you should know and quick overviews of some classic literature but nothing extreamely specific. I used this book in conjunction with my own study program and found the book really worth my while. It's a little light on Lit theory though, so you may want to brush up on that part of the test. Overall I would buy it again. It's written with a dry sense of humor and a drive to see the student do well"
2,Cheap and versatile - this thing is cool!,"What a great little addition to my lenses.IT doesn;t have the best optics, the bag and caps are crap, and it's hard to thread onto my lens, but I'd expect that kind of cheapness from this price point.But the pics I can take with it are really cool! I bring it to all my informal events because it makes the party more fun. Zoom into someone's nose and take a pic. You'll laugh, and so will they. Kids love this thing.Take pictures of dogs, also. They're awesome.The lens extension clipped on my 20D when I had it zoomed all the way out. I have not tested it in my 5D yet.It's cheap. Go ahead and get it! You won;t use it much. But when you do, you'll like it."
2,"good quality, lightweight sign holder!","This sign holder is slightly slanted, and the base is about 2.5 inches from front to back. The slant makes it easier to read if it's sitting on a counter or desk.The acrylic that this is made with is very good quality; it's very clear, about 1/8 inch thick and quite light weight.If your sign holder will be in an area where it will get jostled around a whole lot, or will be subjected to heavy use, you might want to consider a heavy weight sign holder.However, if, like me, you just need a sign holder for ordinary, light-use purposes, this sign holder will work fine. I'm very pleased with it and wouldn't hesitate to buy another. (In fact, I'm now planning to buy this same brand in a couple other sizes as well.)"
2,Part Snapshot/Part Look at Trends,"A large portion of the book has limited shelf life, i.e., he expresses deep disappointment in the election of Bill Clinton (in his FIRST term) and strongly implies that he will be defeated in the next election. He goes on to larger issues referred to in the title and looks at larger trends in the nation. He cites victories of the ACLJ in specific court cases throughout the country. Some citations are specific, others are not. He sees America as being at a crossroads with the future direction being yet undetermined."
1,Can't tell - vendor substituted a different product.,Beware buying on the web. The product you get may not be the product you order. In my case vendor substituted a different model.
2,Got some good ideas :),"I got this book for my two youngest ones at the time 2 and 3. I did get some good ideas from the book that worked for us. But there is really no true, No cry way to get kids to sleep. Just gentle consistency, time, and a little/a lot of patience helps too. :)"
2,"Moore, please","This is a highly worthwhile addition to the original DARK FUTURE series written largely by Jack Yeovil (Kim Newman) back in the 1980s. Moore, a former editor then freelance writer at DC Comics, makes the mileau his own. I'm looking FWD to reading the sequel REALITY BITES.I've bought but not yet read the other new DF books and look FWD to them as well as MORE new books from Moore et alia."
1,"Seriously, are we stupid?","For women who do not understand that a man ""isn't into her"" (and vice versa) bc of his inability to call/contact her, well guess what? She probably already knows there isn't wholehearted interest! The audience for this book is self-selecting, and while i'm glad it's helped some women out, I do believe there are multiple reasons a man doesn't pursue. The real question is: so now what? And for some reason, hearing ""he's not that into you"" ring in my head like an orchestra of clanging bells slows the whole degrading process down. No thanks Greg."
1,Pretty Good,I love New Orleans. This book is pretty good. However. It needs either more recipes and less pictures or vice versa. It's trying to do too much and kind of fails to do either.
1,Sorely dissapointed,"After paying $9.95 I was dissapointed to find out that my purchase was only a 24 page download, which once the title page and EXCESSIVE spacing are removed you end up with a document that could be condensed to 6-7 pages. What is worse, is that the 7 pages of information are so general it can not provide any value to anyone. The author provides 2 sentences of material for most of the PeopleSoft Modules that a formal PS training class would dedicate 200-500+ pages on. The selling of this as the complete coverage of everything PeopleSoft is very, very, very dissapointing. 0-stars"
1,Polly Pocket vendor rips you off,"The item is a number of small Polly Pocket figures and is OK for girls from 6 to 11. The problem I encountered is it was OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED. One of the packages was priced at $39.95 and the other slightly different but with the exact number of figures was $49.95. After cancelling this order and being charged a $25 restocking fee, I proceeded to my local Target and Walmart and purchased the EXACT SAME ITEMS for $7 each! Yes, seven dollars on sale (the regular price was $9.95 at all stores I visited). So, buyer beware of anything coming from JNL TRADING. Do not do it!"
1,"Poor quality, awful technical support","Bottom line, don't bother with this unit. It stopped working after about 10 hours of play. I also have an SP100 which is still working and seems to be higher quality.When I tried to call for technical support I got the same recorded message ""due to the high volume of calls, I should try back later"". Must have attempted to reach them 10 times over a 2 days period, each time got the same recording. I will NOT buy other products from this company."
1,Not worth the money,The CD arrived in excellent conditons and promptly. The merchandise is not worth the money. Too much of the original story is missing in the interest of cramming it in one CD. Will leave you with a lot of questions on how did sherlock homes arrived at his results. Your imagination will not be enough to fill out the gaps in the narrative.
2,A classic in every sense of the word,"For those who struggle with the length and detail of Le Morte d'Arthur or Lord Tennison's poetic version of same, a work showing the beauty, honor, ethics and chivalry of Arthurian legends is not lacking. The Once and Future King is an extremely well crafted interpretation, showcasing the moral and ethical dillemas faced by all those with power over their environment or others. Some may call the book preachy, but I find much worth emulating in this tale of gentle sadness."
2,how to clean?,"I love it so far, but does anyone have any good cleaning tips? I am worried I will ruin the product if I wash it everytime in water."
2,Probably the last Statesmen Quartet newer project,"The name ""Hovie Lister"" will forever be linked to southern gospel music as a true leader and legend. Hovie, who passed away on December 28, 2001, has left behind a gem with this newer project featuring the Statesmen Quartet, which he orginized and managed since 1948. This record is a top-notch project with top-notch musicians, including Anthony Burger on piano. Jack Toney is outstanding in writing some great songs and singing the lead. The quartet has truly a quartet sound: no screechy tenor, no sloppy bass or twangy lead...just a true, clean/crisp southern gospel quartet sound (a trademark of the Statesmen). Hovie out does himself featuring one of his classics, the Bill Gaither tune, ""Thanks To Calvary"". For you who have enjoyed this group down through the years, get this one while the gettin's good."
2,Great educational tool for elementary school,"I used this as part of my Brain Awareness Week activities for my second graders. I love how it is color coded, shows the parts of the brain, and is durable! It feels like a nerf football...which is what you want in an elementary class. I wish there was a way to make the two sides stick together, but that is minimal. Fortunately the outside of the brain is grey and not the yellow pictured. Excellent!"
2,Kids love it!,"Now there are a bunch of touch/feel books out there, so they may be more appealing. I DO know that, when our kids were little (long ago), this was one of the few out there and it was universally loved by them and many of their friends. That said, I opt to send what I KNOW to be a home run to kids now."
2,Solomon-Kaylee Parsons,"This was an excelent read with exicting cliff-hangers at all the right times. I loved the fact that if one of this mixed up family was missing no one could function. Every one needed each other. Although Solomon didn't want to follow in his father, Moses' footsteps he still did what he was told. Solomon was very curious about everything and sometimes it got him in trouble. Solomon was a great read for any age. I also loved the fact that this is a book of forida heritage. As many know Florida history books are few and far between. It ws truly an awesome book."
2,Great Medical Mystery,I'm always looking for good medical mysteries...I love Robin Cook books especially. This is a great page-turner-- I highly recommend Soul Survivor. I look forward to reading more from this new author.
2,Nice phone,"The phone is nice, I like it and does everything I need it to. It does take some getting used to, but after a while it lives up to the communications monster rep it has. Although web-page formating is awkward, it does a good job. I've had it for about 6 months and it's still working like a charm. The only drawback is the size, it's not big, but it ain't small either. Users need to be able to change the keyboard locale to whatever they want.So if you want a nice PDA, it's great. The camera sucks, but the rest of it is great for what you pay for (...)."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"What I wanted was three men seeking monsters. I wanted to red about six weeks in pursuit of Werewolves, Lake Monsters, Giant Cats, Ghostly Devil Dogs, and Ape-Men. What I got was a hundred pages of ""me and my mates knocking about the pubs and having a laugh"" before anything really happens. I wanted more cryptozoological searches and theories, less narrative about the author and his friends just hanging out."
1,Just not as good as the show,I really like ths show and cant wait to buy the next season but this is just not as good. we didnt even finish watching it.
2,Solid lock,"Combination is easy to set but requires small key. Hard to keep up with key if you're going to change combo later. Dial turns only one way and numbers aren't as easy to see as some competitors. However, it is one the heavier duty combo locks that I have used. It is probably more intimidating to the lazy thief than many other combo locks which tend to be more geared to lockers. We use them in our service business. No keys to loose or forget when multiple employees going to the job site."
2,memorable...just as good as the first one if not better,"Cynthia Voigt really out did herself this time. Dicey's Song is the second book in the Tillerman Cycle, and follows the same story from her first book, Homecoming. Although I think that it might be best to have read the first book before diving into Dicey's Song I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys watching a character grow emotionally and internally....What I liked most about the book is that Voigt really develops the plot into life like situations. She shows the ups and downs in life and isn't afraid to put the sheer truth out. As the novel progresses Dicey is faced with one of the most difficult situations yet. From this experience she learns that life is unpredictable and never gets any easier. The entire novel will touch your heart, it sure touched mine."
2,Great Cars,"This movie is all about the cars. So what if the plot was weak or repeated. It was about street racing, not surfing as in Point Break. So if you are a car fan you should enjoy this movie. It's good to see any car movie coming out of Hollywood. The cars were simply amazing. The red Mazda RX-7, orange Toyota Supra, and green Mitsubishi Eclipse were all well done with the performance modifications and body work. The race scenes are tight, but there should have been more of them in my opinion. As far as the acting goes I think Vin Diesel and Paul Walker did a good job. The ladies did a good job as well, Jordana Brewster as Mia and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. So in conclusion, if you like car racing and women you should go see this movie."
2,"Nice strap, would buy again","The look of this strap is very nice. It has a sharp appearance that blends in with my Sunburst Strat without looking drastic to distract you from the guitar.It's very comfortable, and adjustable to virtually any length you could want.The fabric has a slight tendency to buckle a little, so its not a perfectly flat strap... but it is nicely padded, so I guess thats why it buckles. This is not a problem, though. I like this stap a lot and would buy it again."
1,Poor recording for our needs,I bought this for my daughter to hear herself sing. The recording is distorted and full of static. Very low quality sound for music recording. Waste of money!!!! I wanted to rate it zero.
2,Great projects!,Lots of easy to do projects. Most of the projects can be adapted to suit your own decorating style.
2,"Not my choices, but WHO CARES?","This book, as the title states, is a compilation of the author's choices for Best Picture, Actor, and Actress from 1927-1991. It's not on the same level as Peary's ""Guide for the Film Fanatic,"" because cult films aren't included (obviously) and it's Peary's love for more obscure, curious films that I feel rates his books higher than Ebert's or Kael's. I don't think the book is meant to degrade the Academy as much as it is to expose readers to some lesser-known or underappreciated performances (I can only assume he's a big fan of Chaplin). Whatever Peary's reason for writing it, his analyses of the films and of the performances that he cites as best in every year are well-written and thorough, and this book is a treat for anyone who enjoys reading about film."
1,"Underpowered, flimsy, poorly made, overpriced","This edger probably works find for light work in sandy soils. It does not work if you have an edge that has never been edged before in clay soil with tough sod. Mine overheated and the motor burnt out. The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal (amazing there is a metal part on this) shaft by a screw. Not a bolt, not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened. The handle, powerhead, and shaft all wobble in relation to each other. The housing is cheap plastic. The blade is not sharp and showed considerable abrasion and wear after just a few of minutes of use. This product is like everything else Black and Decker has made in the last decade or so...junk."
2,Buena calidad,"producto de buena calidad, trae instrucciones detalladas de uso, valvula de liberacion para no tener que conectar y desconectar. se ve algo fragil, asi que manipular con cuidado."
2,My favorite anesthesia text for the ABA exam,My primary source for the ABA exam. I passed the 8/05/08 exam!!! A great source. Read it three times before the exam and if you understand the information you will pass the exam. The regional section was particularly helpful.
1,I hate it,"I was truly looking forward to this product and was extremely dissapointed. The inside diameter is too small and this info is not provided. I own a Fuji road bike. I was going to buy another product until I realized it was manufactured by the same company. Again, no info on the diameter is provided. You just lost a customer."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"The characters are paper-thin, and are comically stereotyped; shaped by the author's knee-jerk liberal feminist outlook. Thus, every white male is a pig, a lout or a rapist, the black male love interest spouts a lot of phony jive dialog, and the female characters are strong, hip and wise - even the villain. None of the characters talks like any real person ever did. If the characters don't annoy you, the plot will. It proceeds at a snail pace through every predictable turn of this type of law novel. The ""surprise"" ending is telegraphed to all midway through the book. It's a bomb. My advice: stick with Scott Turow, and hope that Mimi Wesson does a better job on her next book."
1,Worked great for 1 season and then trigger broke off,"The ""switch-lever"" starts and stops the mower. After one season the handle broke while mowing and now we cannot start the mower. Also note that a small key unlocks the safety of the mower and we almost lost this in the grass once which would have also made the mower unusable."
1,vomit!,"this product made my entire condo reek of vomit! the smell intensified as the days went on, it's now day 5 of the ordeal and i have layered baking soda on to neutralize the order. i have even had comliants from the condo management that the neighbors were complaining of a strong odor. if it's bad enough people in other apartments can smell it, i think that's a pretty good indication that this is a horrible product."
1,Don't really care for any of the books in this pack,"We love The Going to Bed Book and illustrations, so I bought this to add to my 10 month old's library. I personally don't care for any of these books. The illustrations are cute, but rather than little stories they seem to be more rhythmic, rhyming words. Maybe when my son is more interested in looking at the pictures he'll enjoy them, but for now he just likes to listen to stories so these aren't for him."
2,A stunning version of the Joan of Arc story,"When I was first made aware of this movie, and saw that it was a silent film I was a little skeptical about the plaudits I had read about this film(Roger Ebert among many others). This version uses Richard Einhorn's Voices of Light as a soundtrack. This haunting music perfectly reflects the mood of each scene and includes a recording of the bell from the church in town in Joan grew up.Watching this movie the first time was stunning experience. Falconetti's glorious performance must rank at the top on anyone's greatest performances of all time list. The lighting, camera work, incredible detail and extreme closeups are a marvel.My recommendation: Watch this with a close friend, or alone; turn off the phone and turn down the lights. This movie deserves a theater presentation without interruption. You will be richly rewarded."
1,Don't waste your time.,This book will teach you nothing other than that the author likes to self promote himself. The content is so basic that you would learn more from children selling lemonade and it would at least be cheaper and you would leave with a refreshing drink. I feel fortunate that I only borrowed it and did not purchase it.
1,plantstand,"Adorable table, great price but marble top was split from one corner to the other. Terms for replacement too much for the price I paid."
2,Interesting and unusual recipes.,"""Party Recipes"" has many interesting and unusual recipes. I have tried several of them already with great success. This book is so interesting that even my husband has picked it up and found favorites for himself."
2,Very Good Book,"This is a very intresting book that gives you glimpses into what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling and how she delt with them by her faith in God.However, it does bother me that this book is an adaptation of Rachel's journals and that the reader may not be getting the whole picture(and this only adds to my personal skepticism of some things surrounding her death and why she died) and this is why I gave the book 4 stars.Overall, this is a very good book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling."
2,perfect album,"talib kweli is my favorite MC..this album is perfect, but reflection eternal - train of thought had a few better cuts...overall this is classic material..cop it.1"
1,worst ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game is impossimble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i can't beat the first level with tahu,you have to make a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong jump!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great mask,"I wore this with a catwoman outfit b/c the ears on that one did not stay up. This mask however was pretty cool, shiny, fit ok and kept me warm when I was cold LOL. It does have a ride up factor but with time spent repositioning I finally got it so that it would not ride up. I had lots of great compliments on this and recommend to others."
1,"Comfortable, easy to use, but horribly limited range","The headset is very comfortable and has a decent battery life. Getting it to work with my phone was easy and straight-forward. Putting the headset to use was impossible. I would have to hold the phone close to my headset to get it to work. The headset would lose connection or the signal would become very weak if I had kept the phone in my pants pocket.It really can't be considered ""hands free"" if I have to hold the phone next to the headset, right? I might as well be holding it to my ear."
1,product doesn't match with what photo shows,"the product i received doesn't match with what photo shows and differs from the one i bought before. i cant tell the difference from ""3 Pack Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle 8 oz"", which is much cheaper."
2,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,"This is a great product. It is definitely needed if you want to watch DVD/Blu Ray on your PS3. Of course you can do all that with your controller, but it is much easier if you have the controller. It is well made and worth every penny. No regrets."
1,"I COULDN'T GIVE ""0"" STARS","THE ""ANTIQUE BRONZE"" IS BROWN PAINT. THE ARMS PLASTIC. ONE SNAPPED RIGHT OFF. IT WENT RIGHT BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD HOWEVER, THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT."
1,Better than some of the old time stuff.,"Not great, but better than some of Eden's old stuff. I would five it more stars but I do not want to lead you on. You might watch it once a decade."
2,Great Book for Class!,Book is a great deal of help for the class I am taking and should help tremendously for future psychology classes.
1,"Disappointed, misleaing","VERY disappointed! The curtains took 6 months to arrive, then instead of getting the Galatic Heroes curtains with the Star Wars images, what I received was blue curtains with the Star Wars logo screen printed instead.The picture did show curtains WITH the images!!! That is what I wanted but not what I received."
2,Its basically the same game from 2 years ago,"Lets face it people, Madden is outdated, its just not fresh anymore. The gameplay is the same from 2 years ago which is still too slow, the only difference is the graphics get a ""little"" better each year and the rosters are updated. The addition of Owner Mode is pretty cool, i really like the feature where you can hire real NFL coaches and setting the prices of different things. After playing the game for a long time, you begin to realize some things that bring the game down. First off, the Packers are WAY! overrated in the game, Michael Vick is rated too high for a QB and Madden was way off on his rating for Culpepper and the Vikings. These little things combined with sluggish gameplay make this game outdated. If you want to be an owner stick with Madden, If you want to be a PLAYER pick up ESPN NFL Football. GO VIKES!"
1,Disappointing,"It might have been the voice (which IMO was not gentle/comforting), the accompanying music or the whole presentation, but I found myself more awake at the end of her presentation than before."
1,Read the book instead,"Isabelle Holland's The Man Without a Face is a strong, daring work that deserves wider attention than its placement in the ghetto of ""young adult"" fiction. Unfortunately, Mel Gibson's film version does to the story what the car accident did to the visage of his character--disfigures it beyond recognition.Here the original is bowdlerized and trivialized. It's decent enough entertainment, but it should have been so much more.Read Holland's novel and skip the movie."
1,Chloroform in Print,"Mark Twain once referred to the Book of Mormon as ""chloroform in print."" He also commented that if you took all the phrases, ""And it came to pass"" out of the book, one would be left with a pamphlet. The Book of Mormon has become an American standard in some sense over the past 175 years. To fully understand the book, however, it should be read with another book to give it context such as Grant Palmer's, Insider's View of Mormon Origins."
2,Come take a tour of an Italy you may not be familiar with,"This memoir recounts the story of the author, Paul Paolicelli, and his 3-year journey in and around Italy in search of his Italian roots. He is an American with a rare opportunity to immerse himself in another culture for an extended period of time. The locals he encounters, including the endearing Luigi, are warm and down-to-earth. They have a love for life and culture that comes from living in smaller villages away from the larger metropolises.I especially enjoyed reading about the author's struggle to learn Italian and how he rediscovered his love for playing the trumpet. It's a fun irony that he found a new love for jazz (an American tradition) in Italy (known for classicism)."
2,Yee Haw !!!,"Nothing like grabbing a tub of deer jerky, some Schlitz, some pistacchios and beer nuts while sinking into a lazyboy to watch some good old Eastwood westerns! Hang 'Em High is one of my all time favorite films as I give it a review of five beer nuts!"
2,It really is good.,I have no complaints about any of the acting whatsoever. Also the direction is flawless and the vibe is genuine. A little disturbing too perhaps. Cement your dissension towards neo corporate cinema and add another gem to your collection with this one!
2,Works for me!,"We installed this unit to replace an in-the-wall unit. It went in smoothly, we appreciated being able to fit in the light shell before having to hoist the heavy part. The remote control makes it easy to use. It is nice and quiet and doesn't make that annoying ""thump"" when it switches on that our old unit did. Very happy with this purchase!"
2,"Finally, an explanation!","I love Dr. Mona Lisa's work and listen to her on Hay House Radio. Use her books for reference along with Dr. Christiane Northrups' books. Mine are on the shelf next to psychology, anatomy, & physiology texts, nutrition, and spiritual books. The New Feminine Brain is sourcebook about brain functioning, gender, behavior, female and male hormones, family dynamics, medication, therapy models, and so on. You get the picture. There are fascinating case studies in TNFB. This is not a book you sit down to entertain yourself with, ie it is not "" a little light reading."" Use the book to look up what you, or your client, or a family member's issue might be. This is a great book for women (and men) studying medicine, psychology, coaching, and intuition. And women, buy the book for your sanity! :-)"
2,I LOVE this BIKE!!!,"I got this bike to train for a local Eco-Challenge. I have ridden it well over 200 miles on very rough terrain. It is great! It never misses a beat, and it eats up rocks, ruts, and hills. I am happy to report that with this bike I won 2nd place in the Eco-Challenge (in the Women's division)! Thanks Schwinn for making such an affordable tough mountain bike! I highly recommend this bike!"
2,Sign Language Flash Cards Make It Easier For Mom,"I really liked these flash cards because you only learn 25 signs at a time and the flashcards are easy to work with. My husband and I taped them to the wall behind the changing table, in the kitchen, and in various spots around the house to help us remember to use the signs when we were doing the specific activites. Not to mention, our son loves the pictures on them and plays with them too."
1,Where's the emotion?,"I, personally, was disappointed in this book. The first four grabbed me and made me care about the characters. This one left me not caring about most of them in the slightest. Even the death scene had no effect. The character of Harry came across as whiny, self-absorbed and complaining. Yes, I know that's typical for his age, but I'm not looking for reality in a Harry Potter book; I'm looking to escape reality. Everyone seemed so two-dimensional in this story. Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Dursleys, the Weasleys, everyone...they were all just paper dolls.I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I sincerely hope everyone else enjoys it more than I did."
2,Granddaughter loves animals and your magazine,My Granddaughter loves animals and your magazine. This gives her a world view on the animal kingdom. Thank you for the fabulous info.
2,Get one,"If you bbq away from home this is your grill. Just purchased a replacemnt for one that I've used for over 12 years. From 49er and Giants games to camping trips in Yosemite, up and down the coast from Jenner to Big Sur and Death Valley to Utah, this grill always comes through."
2,Used them for years,Always first rate. Work well. I have never had an issue with them. Currently have six of them in use.
1,Pet Canteen,This product did not serve very well. Hard to use and I returned it after one use. I don't recommend it.
1,This book is demeaning and redundant.,This is a book for cowards seeking some facet or excuse to call themselves alcholics. It spells out in subtle ways the nature of a CULT. This book revels in a POWERLESSNESS theory and claims that a drinker has a disease. For anyone who would like to become a part of a herd of stupid sheep. This is a great organization
1,An hour on the web is time better spent...,"Unfortunately as with many of Sir Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy series, ones money is much better spent elsewhere. If you can find this book for under $10.00 then it might not be a bad addition to a library but it is overpriced and out of date within months of being published. If your reading this review you obviously are online, so save the money and spend your time surfing the web. Try the Cloudy Nights review sites or even the Astronomy and Sky and Telescope sites for more pertinent information."
1,Stuck with Brother's Ink too,"if you print a lot and try to save ink expense, do not buy this one. I could not refill it with low-cost-bottled ink; I have to buy the expensive original Brother ink which runs out quick."
1,"An interesting, though disjointed read!","The book was slow moving and somewhat confusing. I had to reread several pages for clarification. The pages overflowed with strange, but interesting characters and their connections were not always clear.Was there symbolism in the dream about a walking, talking, slit pig? That still has me baffled. The end was a shocker, I would never have guessed it.All in all, the book was ok. Ms. Haynes did a good job blending the different southern cultures. A good book of 400 pages usually takes me one week, this one took over a month. This was my first read along with Oprah, I was determined to complete it!"
1,Dull as dishwater.,"By this time, the time being 1980, Steeleye Span were done. There ability to take centuries old British folk songs and interpret them through a rock vein seemed exhuasted. This uninspired sounding recording is marred by weak song selection, uncharacteristically tepid musicianship and slick production. Stick with any of their 70's recordings avoid all that came after as the magic got lost...Simon"
2,Totally has improved my yoga experience,"this mat is awesome. I just roll it over my yoga mat and my yoga experience is 1000% better. The towel absorbs all my sweat, and the little grippy bumps on the other side keep the towel from moving anywhere. Plus, it folds up really small. It's great quality and has made yoga so much less frustrating for me! I will never ever take a yoga class without it again."
2,5 stars,"I loved this VHS form of Where's Gary? It may not be cheap, but it's worth every penny!This video indlucded every heartwarming detail of the sepisodes, and four additional ones. It also included a song (Come home Gary) at the end.You won't waste your money on this!"
1,Listening To Static On The Radio Would Be The Same,These folks have two zeros. Zero for talent. Zero for brains.This is not music-it is noise. Just like the noise a failingbearing makes in a car or other machine.Do not waste your money on this trash.These folks must be laughing all the way to the bank.
1,Mediocre performance,"This was the top-of-the-line bagless vacuum cleaner available at a local retailer. It doesn't do a good job in general, particularly on pet hair. The main vacuum has little power, and the attachments have next to none. I would not purchase this product again."
2,Excellent gift,My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. She has enjoyed reading it through out X-mas vacation. I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift.
1,Impractical,"I did not like this book because all the answers to the problems are listed in plain sight immediately below the questions. Just in reading through them I catch sight of the answers and it is very impractical. I prefer the ""Dummies"" workbook."
1,Dangerously Dissapointed,"From bootylicious to canned spinach. Girl this Cd is Dangerously in need to become a mirror or something useful. I don't mean to hate, but if you listen to this cd you will understand. I was a big Beyonce fan. I really think this album was rushed and had to many guest artist. I seriously think if she were to tape sounds of herself going to the bathroom and try to sell that she would get the same results. The only good song is ""Crazy in Love"" backed by JayZ. Sorry Beyonce better run back to Destinys Child. You nor Kelly Rowland are going to make it far by yourselvs."
2,Better than regular chips,I like these so much better than the Original (red can) chips. They are lighter and crisper and less salty. I eat them because of the taste not because of the reduced fat. I will order a case when they get them back in stock!
2,Skye Rockets,"I'm a major Tolkien fan, thanks to my dad, and I thought reading this book would be a great way to learn more about Tolkien's life and what influenced his writing and ideas. It started off as a great read, until I got to the end of page 86, where it suddenly skipped to page 119!!!!!!!!!!! The middle of chapter five turns into the middle of chapter 7. I bought the book at a Borders bookstore in Michigan and I have already gone back and placed an ordered for another copy, but I am hoping other copies are not missing pages. I did enjoy reading this book because the author delves deep into Tolkien's life to give the reader all aspects. I recommend this book to any Tolkien fan. Hopefully, I will get another copy soon!!"
1,okay,"Hmmm...what to say indeed. Well, this could be an OK story if, you know, it was a short story. Basically not much happens and a lot of the story describes the land and how Levin is so wonderful and devoted to his wife. Some whould say that this is superb literary thechnique, I say that if you are publishing a novel, let it have a story line. Anna's hardly even in the story anyway. Most would argue that Levin (the goodie two shoes) is the protagonist because he represents Tolstoy's view of Russia."
2,Very Pretty But Sized Incorrectly,"This is a lovely ring but like another shopper mentioned, it is a very snug fit. I ordered this for my thumb where I usually where a size 6. The ring was extremely tight so I've opted to return it for a larger size. The original ring fit perfectly on my ring finger where I normally wear a 5.5."
1,Defective! These should not even be sold.,"I ordered and receive these Oral B Precision Clean, formerly Flexisoft toothbrush heads from LightDeals. Why are these even being sold?! Every brush I used lasted approximately 4 brushings before the heads got so loose that they would pinch the inside of my mouth. Every one of them.What's up with these?!Not only will I never buy the Flexisoft again, I will not buy from LightDeals because they sell inferior products.Another rip-off."
1,Like Sheets in the Wind,"I dropped my Motorola into this pouch, and it was clearly too big for it. I'm guessing this is a generic pouch with an ""M"" on it."
2,inspirational must see,"I rarely write reviews, but this movie really moved me. I am not certain how historically accurate this movie is, but it inspired me to research the issue and the people involved. It was not as cinematically stunning as most period pieces, but that would only have distracted from the story. This movie is a must see for everyone from every walk of life."
1,Dont Get This...,"i bought this guitar for $230...not woth anything. i brought it to my local guitar center, and they said they would give me $50 for it. this guitar sucks."
2,Spiritually Uplifting!,"I couldn't stop listening to this book. I bought the first audio book because I had a long drive and it looked interesting. Now I have read some of the other reviews, and I don't know if the audio version is that much more ""alive"" but I could feel all the emotions that the characters were going through. At times I forgot that I would not be one of those left behind. This book, and the rest, are going through all my friends' hands. I don't want any of them to be Left Behind. I am so excited to read that there will be 6 more in the series. I will run out and buy each as soon as they hit the bookstores!"
2,This is wonderful!! I loved it!!,"I loved this movie! I can't say enough about it! This movie has it all: action, suspense, and romance. Who could ask for more? And, the stars do a wonderful job of portraying these three teens. Oh, and Muponi was really cool! Everyone, word up! This would be great for family fun night, or just lounging around the house.Now really, guys, don't pass this one by while walking the video shelves. I can guarantee it is worth your time and effort to pick this movie up off the shelf and watch it! Who knows, you may even like it! I sure did, that's for sure!"
1,This Book Needs Updating or Another Publisher,"This 7th Edition was published in 1999, but a good bit of the material seems to date from an earlier era. Remarks about 35mm photography, for example, refer to a level of technology that prevailed much longer ago. The photographs (none in color) are very, very dated in style (were they made in East Germany?), and in fact many of them are held over from the 1st edition (1967). Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy. I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again. This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins. Luckily, though, a lot of things about view cameras are the same as they have always been, so the basic content of this book remains altogether usable."
1,"Bad, very bad.","Do whatever you can to find a text that more clearly explains the theories and theories in practice of language teaching. I am currently using as a textbook in an introductory Teaching ESL course. We read out of it, but most of the material is omitted, corrected or adjusted by our instructor."
2,Chapter 3 alone would be worth the cost!,The must have Perl resource. It was written by the the creator of Perl for goodness sake! Offers thorough reference to Perl's rich set of text manipulation features. Not a tutorial but more of a intermediate/expert reference manual. Get Learning Perl(Camel Book) and this book. You will be a perl hacker in no time flat!
2,"Great Album, Better than his Sausages !","Every Song on this album brings back my childhood memories. I remember these playing on the radio station WHOW , Clinton , Illinois, Country Music Capital of the Midwest . I always liked his songs and acting a whole lot better than ANY of his greasyfood products !"
1,"Holy repackaging, Batman!","The two ""non-album"" tracks are not only featured on the import releases of ""We Have The Facts..."", but are also on ""The Forbidden Love EP"", which tends to sell for less than this single and is much better. Also, every track on it had never been previousily released, which is a big plus. What I'm saying is that this single offers NOTHING that you wouldn't already have if you'd purchaced earlier releases. Still, as much as I hate record labels repackaging old stuff without adding anything new to sweeten the deal, I have a strange urge to buy this since it is three of thier best songs and I'm dying to see the cover art."
2,Very nice unit,"Very nice, well built unit, but the wrong size for my trailer cut-out as a replacement. It is better built than my original. It could use 2 keys instead of only one (it is taped on the side of the unit so look for it there). 5 stars from me. If you are cutting your own hole this is a nice size and looks like good quality and a better shower head than most I have seen."
1,Rip off!! Want Extended Version!,"I love LOTR, but I don't like that this product is the theatrical version! I WILL NOT buy the LOTR trilogy on blu ray until there's an extended version released.This sucks because I have already been waiting SO long for LOTR to be released on blu ray (hoping it would be the extended version).The studio should release both the theatrical and extended versions simultaneously!"
2,I have recommended this book over and over!,The Book Thief has been a favorite of mine. I recommend it to anyone who asks for a good book to read. It gives you a look back into time and perspective of some of what the people were going thru. What you had to do to survive. It's a good book with good characters and it's a novel in which you can learn something. I recommend that you read it and that you have your children read it. It's a wonderful thing when you can learn a lesson from a book.
2,Great Product,"This product is everything it says it is. It's a little hassle to slide the front wheel in its separate pouch, though not so much to complain about. There's a learning curve to handling the bike and getting it to fit in the bag. Once it's in, it fits like a glove."
2,An unbelievable book!,"I didn't expect to like this book but after the first few pages how could I not? It was fantastically written, one of the best books I've ever read. It was the kind of book that you don't want to end. The stories about friendship and love really sought out your emotions. It was hard to put down. Judy Blume is an excellent writer and I recommend this book highly. If you've ever fallen in love or ever had a best friend, than this book is for you."
1,Not what I expected,"My first camera was a Mustek, and I sold it to someone because they were in urgent need of a camera to take on vacation. After reviewing the reviews for this camera, I said I may as well give it a try. Wrong answer. The pictures are horrible. They don't come out clear regardless of what setting it is on. I would not recommend this camera."
2,Comforting,"I got this for a friend who had a miscarriage. I first read it and was very moved, often to tears. An excellent book! Recommend getting this along with two other (in my opinion) even BETTER books: I'll Hold You in Heaven Remembrance Book and Mommy, Please Don't Cry."
2,Please Forgive My Ignorance,"I love the film. I love the music in it. So, could anyone let me konw title&author of ALL the songs that sound in the movie ?Another thing: is there any customer from SPAIN i can contact ?"
1,Good season but bad quality of the DVD,"I am a fan of Criminal Minds and I own all the seasons.However, I am surprise to find that the quality of this Season DVD is really bad...almost like a VHR or VCD quality... =("
2,have read the books and enjoyed the video,"the video is well done. it follows so much of the book, which i'm happy i read before seeing the video."
1,Not the actual Garmin mount!,I ordered this thinking that it was the exact type of mount I originally had with my Garmin Nuvi. I received a huge mount that is inconvenient and ugly. Beware! I should have spent the extra money to purchase directly from the Garmin website!.
1,Vague,"I was expecting more information than this book offered. It did contain some basic generic information, but bottom line was go and find out how to take advantage of foreclosures in your area by yourself. The entire book took an hour to read."
1,Disappointing,"After hearing the hype on TV about this new novel, I ordered it. I am having a terrible time finding it a compelling read. It is boring, to be honest."
2,"Its Great, But package is a bit "" Beat up""","Looks like it got squashed a little, and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new. But I checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there. I tried one and its great. This is a good buy for what you get. I just got a Damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased. Overhaull 4 stars out of 5 I will buy here again. Fast delivery. Thanks"
1,Repeat of info,"This is a great intro to Charlotte Mason for newbies but for those who have been introduced to Charlotte's approach before reading this book, it would be a waste of time. It's a repeat of information for me. Well written and easy to read but not much help for myself. I prefer Catherine Levison's basic how to guide to Charlotte Mason."
1,"The Director, Writer and everyone involved in this movie is a Disgrace to the TV Series.","I hated it once I saw the cast and then once everyone started actually speaking I felt even more disgusted. I can not possibly believe that anyone who ever saw the TV series would produce a movie to monstrosity. The cast is nothing like the movie, the script is atrocious. This movie resembles the TV series in name only."
1,What The Heck...????,"Is this an aberration or a ""new direction""? If its the former, glad to hear it. If its the latter, thanks its been fun but I'm done.You ever read a book and think....what was/is going on with this author that this book is the result? Thats how I felt about this book.Maybe its just me, but having your main character screwing around every chapter with another male with an enormous schlong and calling it ""characer development"" is laughable to the extreme.If you're a Jean-Claude or Richard fan, BEWARE !!! They are badly written, dumped on, and in the case of Richard, unbelievably mangled. Ah, but not to worry, Anita has a new instant soulmate, Micah. A character so flimsy and useless the most memorable thing about him is the size of his willy.You had me until this one Ms Hamilton...."
2,A pretty good book,"This was a great book, though very easy to read. The plot was a little unrealistic, but easy to follow. It's not exactly great literature, but good for a nice, quick (and funny) read. If you liked this book, I recommend 'On the Bright Side, I'm now the girlfriend of a Sex God' for another quick and funny read."
2,"Read, imagine, live","A classic of sociological thought, and one of the best (if not the best) accounts on the purpose and tasks of sociological mindset. Sociological imagination (or perspective, if you will) as intersection of biography and history - pure and simple, yet succinctly incisive and elegantly descriptive. Still a very relevant, influential and timely text for each and all."
1,"Too much child pose, no alternative","Tried it, once. Not a success. Given the standing on knees, child pose...etc...my knees screamed NO NO NO! Unfortunately, there were no alternatives (yes, I could create one, but hey--that is what I bought the DVD for right?) His voice off-putting, but would have kept except I had to go to acupuncture to right what this wronged."
1,Mostly Christian BS,"I enjoyed the beginning of this book very much since I am submitting my will to that of God as I understand Her. But then the book degenerated into the kind of Christian BS that it took me years to get out of my mind. I usually have great respect for books but this one offended me so much that I destroyed it. If you're not blinded by Christianity, then avoid this book."
1,Fussy Coffee Maker,"If you like to fuss around making coffee, then this is the maker for you. Step #1 is to cut 1/2"" off the#4 cone filter. Then after the coffee is made, you need to put the little cap on top of the carafe, if you haven't lost it or you cat thought it was his toy. Make the thing so it will take the #4 filter and out a place on it to store the cap and maybe it would be useful."
2,Amazing!!,As always sykes is the man his guitars sound amazing the riffs are sick great songs. if your a sykes fan its the s@!#
1,broken,When I received this Product the package part that hold the DVD into place was broken. When I tried to contact them about the problem they never responded.
2,The most powerful film I have seen in a long time,"Every scene in ""Beasts of the Southern Wilds"" is magnificent. So powerfully and beautifully told, this film lovingly takes us to a place that seems to be missing for most of Western culture, into the arms and jaws of our ancestors and all the beasts of which we are only one. The people in the film did not seem like actors ... Dwight Henry must be Wink in real life and Quvenzhane Wallis must be Hushpuppy - otherwise, how could they do what they did in this film? I am buying this film today and will tell everyone I know about it."
2,Best Palm Keyboard you can get!,"I know that you might think, ""hmm, the best part of Palm is the graffiti and we should stick with that"". I can write 29 words per minutes but there were times when you want to do faster, e.g. during a meeting and you need to take minutes and so on. That is when the Palm keyboard comes in handy. This keyboard was nicely designed (yup, you can flip it to the size of a Palm), using really ""high-tech feel"" material and it's full size key is great! There is one thing I really want it in my wish list. Currently the keyboard is similar to a notebook keyboard which doesn't have the ""feel"" of the keyboard of the desktop PC, I really want to see this to be improved as I don't like the feel of notebook keyboard. Am I expecting too much?"
1,Failed 2nd time I used it,"I was very excited to get this after having to get a cast. I followed all the instructions and was very gentle with this item. While putting it on the 3rd time, the rubber cuff tore making it totally unusable. I'm very displeased with the quality."
2,Great starter for understanding quantum theory and string theory,Lots of examples and detailed information to help understand the principals of general relativity and quantum mechanics. I liked the information about how our micro and macro universes compare and how they differ.
2,Reveo MariVac Food Tumbler,"There is definitively a difference in moistness of chicken and beef. Most notably with chicken. After that you cannot eat regular grill chicken. I did have a problem though. I had a defective lid that did not hold the vacuum, but getting a replacement was very easy. Enjoy!"
2,A diverting tale of wills,"Lady Emily dreams of her great love, the man who will come claim, her husband. All she wants is a man who will love and cherish her. But as the daughter of an English Lord, fate deals her a different hand. Draven de Montague, Earl of Ravenswood comes for Emily, but not as she assumes, as the man of her dreams. A Famous night who intimidates everyone, he has come to kidnap her! At the orders of the King, he comes to steal Emily, hold her for a year in order to stop the two houses from continuing their bloody feud. Despite his plans, Emily is determined she knows the right of it and he will marry her and they will live happily ever after.A faint touch of purple prose mars the effort. It's well balanced with angst and humour in proper portions, but the characters just seemed a wee bit two-dimensional.Still a wonderful read, and showing she has a voice in historical romances that just keeps improving."
1,Three strikes you're out!,"When I first hooked this scanner up I had some problems, so I called for help. The assistant on the other line was rude, and seemed to be in a hurry. I have installed this scanner on my BRAND NEW computer, and oops, mouse slows down, commands slow down, everything slows down and doen't respond. I did a system restore. Installed the scanner again, same problem. Yes, you guessed it I tried a third time. That's it I am returning this product. How could a company sell a product like this. Also, another customer had mentioned that he had Windows ME (2000) and thought that maybe the CD wasn't compatable, I also thought this, but certainly a good company would have updated their software by now. Or let me know when I was on the phone, that some customers may experience system problems. Do not buy this product, don't let the low price fool you."
1,Some Things Don't Age Well,"This is self-indulgent hippiedom at its, well, most self-indulgent. I have nostalgia attacks ocasionally and a listen to this will usually bring me back to the present. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida should make even the most hardcore Summer Of Lover blush. The title cut is musically competent but goes on about 15 minutes too long. The endless noodlings will make The Grateful Dead seem like The Ramones. The rest of the songs are basically filler of the peace, love, and dope variety with the possible exception being ""Most Anything You Want"" which at least manages a melody and some cheesy organ for fun. If you yearn for the sillier part of the Sixties, make the purchase. It's kinda fun in a campy Village People sort of way, although I'm sure that was inadvertant. After all, this was intended to be mescaline influenced high art. If nothing else, your children(and maybe grandchildren) will laugh themselves silly when they hear this fossil from your glory days."
2,The definitive collection,"This is the definitive Gene Pitney collection : two CDs with all the chart hits, a generous helping of B-sides, albums tracks, and lesser-known gems in excellent remastered sound, plus a booklet with photos of LP and 45 sleeves and track-by-track commentary by Gene Pitney himself ... and all at the price of a single CD. Marvellous!"
1,Terrible strap,"I've always liked the features of the Ironman, and the watch itself is still good. The velcro strap, however, doesn't work well and comes undone, even on a new watch. Worse still, the new design only allows for OEM replacement straps. I think this one will be returned."
2,Perfect,"We have tried the cheaper $2 goggles and they didn't work that well, broke easily, twisted, etc.These goggles are great. Both of my kids (ages 6 and 4) have greatly improved there swimming ability thanks to wearing good goggles. The stay on without having to readjust the straps and I haven't got any complaints on comfort. I am going to order a back-up pair for each kid incase we lose a pair (bound to happen)."
2,Another Great Book,"Another great book from the "" Old Time Preacher."" If you have read his biography then nothing more needs to be said. Get all of his books you can. They are going out of print far too fast. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Vance Havner preached the Gospel, clear and concise and worldly people can't stand it. Hence.... not much demand for his writings."
2,cool,This is great grunge. But I would like it more if I could understand some of the words they say. I like it. you should listen to the samples
1,"Unhappy, product had expired - could not use","I ordered Microsoft Home and Student 2007. When I recevied it and tried to use it it would not work. In looking at some of the files I found that this Copy was no longer valid after October 26, 2009. I could never even get up the screen to put in the registeration key. I needed this software very badly to prepare resumes because I am unemployed. Now I don't have what I need and will have to wait for my refund before I can purchase a valid copy. Please be very careful of any software you purchase from this seller.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
2,This is an excellent book.,"I highly recommend this title to any parent, teacher or librarian that is concerned with the education of young children. It is a thoughtful and well-written examination of the issues surrounding the use of computers in education. All too often books of this type are nothing but sales pitches and ""techno-babbble"" from someone in the computer industry. This book is a wonderful exception."
1,I recommend a much better book than this one.,"I read this book and I think that it is trash. The rules go against nature. I do however, highly recommend the book titled How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You, written by Leil Lowndes.The book How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You is much more realistic (I also give this book 5 stars)."
2,excellent product,I have bought several of these logitech web cams for myself and other family members. It was easy to install and use. Very happy with the video/sound using the web cam.
1,"Do not buy this Oil, Its just Cannola Oil repacked and Over Priced","Hello my fellow Amazon Reviewers, I used to be the head Recycle and Facility's person for a large tech company in SF Bay Area, about 450 Employees. I was responsible for shredding about 100 pounds of confidential paper each night, plus caring for each employees personal shredder. We found out that Fellows and all these companies where just repacking Cannola oil and marking it up 10 fold, really 10 fold. Do some research for your self and you will find dozens of articles on google that have actually tested the oils and proven this."
2,Great CD !!,"After not hearing this album for almost 30 years, it was great to have it back in my hands again ! This cd by Kathi McDonald has stoodthe test of time - it is as great today as when it came out (1974 I believe). I nearly wore the CD out the fist week I go it. It isgreat rock and roll with some blues thrown in. The one song that seemed to stand out after all these years was her version of ""ToLove Somebody"". She also did a remake of ""Heatwave"", which is very good and ""Heartbreak Hotel."" I give this album an A++"
2,Very Nice,"I have owned this for a few months now. It performs as expected. It was a good deal at $200 since it is an older model, but the only difference in the new model that I am aware of is a slightly wider screen. I don't feel like that would be worth it. The text to speech does a nice job. It has a lot of great features. The speedometer is nice, showing my car speedo to be accurate and my motorcycle speedo to be about 5% high, both as expected. If you've done your research, you know what it has. I've found everything to be as expected. I like that it also has an MP3 player.Minor Cons:It didn't promise, but I was really hoping it would also have an alarm clock (it is a pretty simple feature) but it does not.I think it is supposed to have the 2008 maps. My house was finished June 2006, the street was there for a while before that, but my street is not on the map."
2,Great Escape,Two of my favorite actors - Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig - are in one movie. How cool is that!! It's a great movie to watch when you just want to leave reality for a while.
2,great instrumental,I have not heard any Cusco that is bad. One of the best instrumental groups in existance playing music that can be enjoyed by anyone since there are no lyrics to interpret. If you listen to this one you will want the rest.
1,Cheap,"This gas is VERY cheap gas. It is not green gas. When you get the item take off the papers and everything. You will find a different company logo than the one pictured. [...]Also, this Airsplat green gas doesn't lubricate the gun."
1,Buy Dusty In Memphis - Re-Mastered instead,"Arif Martin had a huge hand in both recordings - producing the string and horn arrangements in Dusty In Memphis over 30 years ago. The recently released re-mastered version on Phillips is amazing. Rarely have remastered albums convinced me that the ordinary listener could tell the difference.Norah had a fine first outing with this CD, but awarding it - album of the year - is like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx.Let's give Norah another ten years to see how this album holds up and see if she can gain some soul in her life experiences which will translate to her music. For now - give Dusty a listen if you want music from the heart and soul."
2,Unpublicised Pulp Fiction,"I read the reviews on [this site] and was surprised they were mixed. ""American Strays"" is only for offbeat viewers who have experienced the wierd side of life along with David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez. Don't take it serious but as an everyday dry humor flick. The bungling frustration of Eric Roberts and pseudo naievity of Jennifer Tilly make this a GREAT film for those who take life very lightly. I liked it enough to make the purchase."
2,Explore the City,"Each time I movve through the City I find new things. Also, you can move through the levels along different paths each time that you play the game. And, you can change the order in which you play.Thief 3 has an amazing complexity."
2,Great,"They really help tune your bow for hunting. Actually fly better than field tips. I would purchase again. Have not hunted with the Montec yet, but the Pre-season fly true and doesn't tear my target up. When practicing they don't penetrate like shooting your hunting blades."
2,Didn't See This Ending Coming,I won't blather on as there are other reviews here. I would give it 4 stars. DHP's Yale talent acting + a great ending is worth your time.
1,"2.5 stars- A pretty mediocre effort, but still is better than the previous studio album","I haven't owned this cd since about 1988 because it's just not the Foreigner that I came to know and love in the years 1977 to 1981. The only song that I like to listen to repeatedly is the song ""Say You Will"". That song is what Foreigner should sound like. Everything else is boring and mediocre. Unless you're a diehard Foreigner fanatic, you should just pass by INSIDE INFORMATION and just stick with their first four studio albums."
1,Disappointed,I had a bad impression of this item. The handle broke off in my hand; the machine did not charge well...eventually didn't work at all.The experience turned me off completely to Euro-Pro products.
2,This is the consumate Christmas Album,"If you want the true spirit of Christmas with choral music both sacred and contemporary....(for the 1950's) with a touch of nostalgia from a simpler time, this is the album for you and your family. With a tenor that can sing like an angel and the rest of the choir of solo quality, yet blending so wondrously....keep this cd in your collection. It's the best every made."
1,third one and last one,This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons. This one didn't even last this season. not wasting any more money on these things.
2,Comfortable and perfect for around the house,"Great sweatshirt to lounge around the house. Not too think where I am hot, but allows me to turn the heat down so I dont have huge gas bills. I bought several more colors of this brand. Very pleased with this product."
2,Excellent edition,"I think I speak for many when I say that after many years of enjoying Tolkien's book, I wanted to have a nice copy for my library. The books I read as a boy show their age and as Lord of the Rings is one of my ""must have"" books, I wanted an particularly special edition. Sound familiar? For like-minded individuals, there are essentially two choices: the single volume with Alan Lee's gorgeous illustrations (he later became artistic advisor for the movies) or the 50th Anniversary Edition. I got the best of both worlds -- bought the illustrated version for myself and this one for my finacee! As nice as the Lee watercolors are, the 50th Anniversary really is the better book. The binding, paper, cover, and feel are amazing... THIS is what a great book should feel like. Also, this is the final revised text, so it is marginally better. Don't let the price discourage you, it is definitely worth it, and this is a book to treasure."
1,No - Talent attention seeker.,"Luckily I did not waste my money on this album. All I have to say is that it's pretty sad when the band felt that they needed to name the album this particular name. They know why they did it, they figured it would get some attention, maybe even from some particualr star. Based on the album title alone, theres obviously no originality in this band, and most likely no talent either. Avoid this one."
1,Pretty sloppy,"As someone who has enjoyed many a pot-luck in the basement of a Lutheran church, I was pretty excited to get my hands on a copy of this. What a disappointment. This book is mostly recipes, which unfortunately don't come with very detailed instructions. As far as the jokes and (not terribly) funny stories, they are rife with spelling errors, confusing paragraphs ( I honestly had trouble telling if Lutherans eat fruitcake or not) and other indications that this book needed some serious editing. Finally, by ""Lutheran"" the authors apparently mean ""Scandinavian"" as there isn't much mention of German-Americans in the book. The best part of this book is the collection of vintage photographs, which don't have any captions."
2,Bing and Satchmo are always great,"This CD of Bing and Satch is great. Bing Crosby's radio shows, as most of that era of radio, had lots of adlibbing from the script. They were so comfortable together, as they were good friends in the business. Bing's voice is like comfort food such as chocolate (if you love it) or a good hamburger, or jello with whipped cream, etc. Louis Armstrong was a great musician, so with the combo of great musician and great singer, one can't go wrong. With Bing and Louis on this CD you can't go wrong. Diane Barrie"
2,great stuff,"applied to my 3 cats on january 7th, it is now the 29th and we have fewer fleas. it does not kill current fleas but breaks the cycle which seems to be working. i would use it again, definitely, need to apply again on february 7th and hopefully that will be it."
1,there are four hole in it....so upset,"I was so upset when I finally got this home. Four holes, not sure why, there are no dividers so the product does not allow for separated recycling. I really found it to be no more than a wax coated cardboard box. Very disappointed."
2,Someone finally understands Mexico and Canada,"This book is a supberb portrayal of the issues and obstacles that seperate the United States from Mexico and Canada. Drawing on personal experience as a husband, father, and NY Times bureau chief living in both Mexico and Canada successively, Anthony DePalma hits nail after nail on the head. With the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) scheduled for ratification by up to 34 nations within the next four years this book is both important and timely. For a person wanting to understand what all the fuss is about with respect to issues of free trade, globalization, protection of the environment, and human rights, this is the starting point. And if you as a reader appreciate careful and meaningful description punctuated by use of the perfect metaphor you will find it here. A simply supberb read!"
1,"MAN, WHAT A TURKEY LOL!","This has to be the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever seen. Nothing at all like the cover suggests.Horrible acting, NO ZOMBIES - unless you call chicks with bad eye liner zombies LOL!Cardboard & plywood makeshift sets thown together in an empty warehouse (reverb echoes and all), props from a Good Will store...looks like it was made on a $20 budget. Luckily, I only RENTED it. Kiss that $4 bucks goodbye LOL!Why, oh WHY would anyone even MAKE something so dumb? On a scale of 1 to 10, this total waste of plastic comes in at -99."
1,Rechargable battery does not work,"At first i thought it was a good bargain, but this player does not have good quality even for the price, slow control response and poor documentation, my real problem with this player is that the rechargeable battery never worked when i connect the usb cable to charg the battery it starts to connect and disconnect and never charges the battery, so this for me like a disposable player, i hate to say this because i already bought it, but my advice dont buy this poor qualiy player"
1,inadequate description,"I just received this product. It is sturdy and should suffice; attaching leg struts to basket was quick and simple, and the handlebar brackets are just fine. The problem is that nowhere in the description does it specify that it only works for a particular type of front wheel hub. There is no warning about not fitting a ""quick-release"" assembly, or requiring a different type of hardware for that. Either make it clear that the basket will not work for certain types of front wheel assemblies, OR be kind enough to supply the alternative hardware and alternative instructions. A couple brackets, a couple screws, and another 2 paragraphs of instructions could not cost more than fifty cents, and would go a long way toward making your product suitable for more people."
2,Very funny!,"I rank Kevin Hart among the top comedians of all time. With that being said, I enjoyed watching this show. I initially thought it was a movie and it wasn't until I started watching that I realized it was a stand up act. I still enjoyed it because again he was comical. Just know that this isn't a movie."
2,A CD for fans and collectors,"I would recommend buying this CD in addition to the US release of ""Under these Rocks and Stones"". Not only are there four bonus tracks, the packaging features completely different photos and a better layout. Leaving on a Jet Plane (the final bonus track) was performed better by Peter Paul and Mary, but Chantal is much more personable, and has more fun with it."
1,Zero stars!!! Avoid this product at all costs!!!!,"We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!"
1,Doesn't work right,I wanted to watch 2 tvs off the one cable box. Or just run the second HDMI cable from the living room to the bedroom. It screws up my inputs & I have to reset everything if I plug both cables in. O well
2,hey they work,"If you need a allen wrench with some nice long handles these are great, i bought both sets and am very please all and all. I recommend."
1,A disappointment,"My friend recommended me this brand since she have heard a lot of good feedback about this. As soon as I receive this product I've tried it right away since I've been looking for a good flat iron for a long time. When I tried it my hair was catching the top edge of the plates, I have my mom and my sister try it, I thought I was using it incorrectly but it turned out they have the same problem as I have. And since the plates extend all the way at the side of the flat iron (you won't see it in the picture it is on the other side) it is very easy to burn yourself. I won't recommend this product to anybody."
1,He's gone overboard with descriptive horror.,"In his previous novels, it was just horrific enough to keep you turning the pages to see what could possibly happen next, but this book just goes over the edge. You don't have the chance to use your imagination because it's all written out for you. After waiting so long for this book, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed, and a bit sick to my stomach. Mr. Harris gives out ""too much"" information this time."
1,?,"I don't get what's going on. The new Outkast is terrbile. Forget all the hype, just listen to one song and you will not want to buy this cd. At least that's if you are a real rap/hip hop fan."
2,Arrived fast and as promised in excellant condition.,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift, and it came very quickly and in excellant condition, as it was advertised."
1,Hopeless,"As a doctoral graduate in toxicology and now a practicing preclinical toxicologist for several years, I rate this book not only as ""poor"", but poorer with each new edition.Consider Goodman & Gilman's Pharmacology. Like C&D;, it is a text with nearly as many authors as chapters, and covers diverse subject material. UNlike G&G;, though, Casarett & Doull's painfully lacks the editorial wisdom, guidance, and ""tie-together"" of the exceedingly disparate chapters. As a result, there is a lot of overlap, and a lot of gaps.In case you graduate students haven't figured it out, this book is essentially the manual for the ABT cert exam. In my opinion, that is the only thing keeping it in print. Otherwise most of us in practice would have a book that covers chapter 6, and then separate references for our area of work. As a preclinical toxicologist, for example, I couldn't give two hoots in hell about air pollution or toxic effects of plants."
2,A Promising Start,"I first found John Ringo through his co-authored works will David Weber. They both write ""hard"" military science fiction, and this one is no differerent. Except its not so much military science fiction as medievial military fiction. True, there exists high techonology, including AIs and genetic engineering, most of the action of this book takes place with swords and bows. A well crafted work of fiction and well worth the read but mostly not sci-fi, but then it didn't claim to be."
1,deep house music,"I was very disappointed with this CD more on the spacey side of house music not the classic Harley& Muscle ,deep house music."
1,junk,"after having 3 dvd recorders fail after less than one year, I have no right to be suprised when this unit's DVD tray refused to open the first time I tried to use it. The only reason I puchased this was to edit recordings from the HDD to DVD. Although the HDD funtion is decent, I need an external recorder to tansfer to DVD. After 4 recorders I didn't even bother to send this one back for a refund. Stay away from this."
2,Excelente Libro,"Empecé a leer este libro por que dos buenos amigos me lo recomendaron mucho. Debo de ser franco, y en un inicio no me pareció atractivo el tema, pero viniendo la recomendación de ellos tenía que leerlo. Para mi muy grata sorpresa el libro me capturo por completo. La narración está muy amena, en el hablan de personajes históricos que no sabía nada de ellos y termina siendo libro muy rico en las narraciones y hasta con unos pasajes de mucho humor. Yo también quiero felicitar al autor el Pbro. Jesús Sánchez A. por este excelente libro!"
2,oh my I love this stuff,I buy the big one 6.7oz for my son he can always smell good for me and his wife truely loves it too...never a disappointment for sure
1,Cristalle - .13 oz eau de parfum sold by Beauty Encounter,"The product that I received is marked clearly on the back ""not for sale"" and was probably made as a sample. Judging by the smell it is way out of date and therefore has lost it's original lovely light fragrance. I do not think this company should be selling samples. Nor should they be selling perfume that is out of date."
2,As Time Goes By - Complete Original Series,This is one of the truely great British Sit-Com series. Now you can watch them all and not have to depend on the local PBS Stations' programing schedual. Really Nice material.
2,A GOOD PRIMER,"I agree with the post that said this book is an excellent primer. It's not for experts but for beginners. From a beginners standpoint it covers covered calls, protective puts and a combination of the two, which is called a collar. These are conservative strategies, as I understand it. Mr. Jardine also tells the reader to trade with the trend, that is, use bearish strategies when the market is trending down and bullish strategies when the market is trending up, and gives examples. The book is a quick read and I recommend it highly for those who have never gone through a bear market and want to know what they can do in one."
2,USB floppy drive,I received the product in the time promised and packaged for immediate use. It was easy to setup and just as easy to share with other users. I still use diskette camera media so my family can load & share pictures easily.
1,Works good for a couple of months,I've tried to use this same gauge 3 times. All 3 resulted in an item which broke. It suffers from direct sunlight. And therefore becomes very fragile and yellowed. One unit had the base you stick in the ground fall off. Overall I give up on this. I should have bought a better unit in the first place.
2,VERY MOVING,"I was pretty young when this came out. I remember singing along with Sgt. Sadler and was thrilled when I came across it again. Whether you believe in the war or not, this was a man who was serving his country and singing about his comrades. The songs bring shivers. He was a true patriot. I was saddened to hear that he died."
1,well......,"tokyo a la mode is way 1 star tokyo mew mew was so much better. that berry girl shouldnt be in the story or at least be the mew mews leader, i mean just because she has to 2genes doesnt she #1 or going to be their new leader, maybe the other mew mew would have been ok but having their leader to be a newbie no way. I wish Ichigo will come back!!!"
2,I love this book!,"A wonderful, therapeutic book. It made me laugh and cry and nod in agreement. It is so much more pleasureable to read than ""Promiscuity"". So much more hopeful! I speak as a member of the generation that raised people Gwen's age and have always considered this group special. They are my generation's kids! I have learned a lot about this group from this book. From a ""cool"" mother!"
2,Stephen Lynch: Live At The El Ray,"I'd never heard of this comedian until some one linked to one of his videos on an internet forum I moderate. He was so funny that I went looking for more of his stuff on Youtube. This guy is so funny that he had me in stitches, and I had to find out if there was a DVD available. There was, and it was well worth the money.The only reason that I gave the video four stars, instead of five, was that one of the video available from Youtube was not on the video, even though this is the show from which it came. That would be his song Special Olympics.Just be aware that if you are offended by jokes of a religious nature, or need your comedy to be very PC, this guy definitely isn't for you!"
1,Quality Book...Author Another Story!,"No problem with the vendor, but as everyone has heard...what a con artist ol' Jimmy turned out to be! My wife just had to have this book...I think the $ could have been better spent. Walter Cronkite's book comes to mind.Glen T."
1,"Direct quote: ""Pure rubbish.""","Three Oingo Boingo band members have already commented elsewhere that this book contains more opinions and assumptions than actual fact, but it doesn't take that fact to notice it. Keith Breese skates through his mis-information and lack of simple research; filling in the blanks with his own imagination. He can't even keep low-level information, something as simple as dates, correct. Three quarters of the book is merely quoting other people's work, i.e. reviews and interviews. As one O.B. member said in an online review that is easily found, ""pure rubbish."" I think that says it all. It is no wonder why respectable publishers would print this; he had to print it himself through Xybris books (a pay-to-be-pulished outfit). The book itself is full of misspellings, bad typeography, misuse of quotations and punctuation, and is devoid of any form of proper grammar. Yes, you can say this isn't the pulp it was printed on, especially at this going price."
2,A Flower Fairies Postcard Book Review,"This little book is perfect if you want to send a quick 'Helloh, 'Thinking of You' or any other special occasion. It's quick and easy and Cicely Mary Barker captures these lovely,graceful and whimiscal fairies in great settings."
1,Not the same formula,"This shampoo lists only 4 ingredients. I loved that version of the shampoo and used it for years. The shipment I received from Amazon was the same bottle but not the same product. Here is the ingredient list: water, cocoamide DEA, sodium laurel sulfate, potassium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, sodiam cocoyl sarcosinate, hydrolyzed wheat protein olivate (olive oil glutinate). This product is unusable and smells like strong industrial pine tar soaps. I hope you get the old formula and not the new chemical one like I did."
2,Digital Watch,"This is a good digital watch. The numbers are plain and it also has the date on it and is easy to use. I bought this watch for my Mother. It has other features, but she does not use them. However it makes a good basic digital watch."
2,enchanted knitting,"The patterns in this book are many, and very nice, from all over the world. Not all of them are usable, but that's a matter of appeal. Most patterns are quite big to knit up, not for small projects. You have to copy and enlarge them first because they're printed very small."
1,So-So-At-Best Screwball,"I guess the reason I had never heard of these particular screwball films is that they are very forgettable. These films are nothing better than okay. The plots are very lame in my opinion. I was so looking forward to watching these films, but after viewing them, it felt like a wasted evening."
1,A total let down :-(,"Not what most people would expect,I purchased this on its release date only watched it twice all these years,and won`t be watching it again any time soon...."
1,Overrated,"I listened to this a few times but I don't think the music is that great, and the prosy religious/moral themes in many of the lyrics turned me off. I bought this because I really loved many of the songs on At Dawn, but I don't hear any of the best qualities of that CD on this one. The songs here have better musicianship and production quality, but the emotional content that I feel I can connect with is less.Besides that, it's curious to me how so many other reviewers think this music ""ROCKS!"". When I think of a band that rocks, I think of something like The New York Dolls or Nirvana, not Wilco, Radiohead, or MMJ. I'm just saying that so readers know where I'm coming from; everyone has their own concept of what rocks. I think Wilco is ok, but somewhat boring, and I find the vaunted Radiohead whiny and annoying. So if you feel that way too, you won't like this CD."
2,Great Gazooba!,"I bought this for my oldest grandchild 12 years ago. It has been through 6 grandchildren (I am their daytime babysitter while their moms are at work) so it has had a lot of play time. All six have loved it from the age of 18 months to about 3 years. The other shape sorters lost their attraction after a few months, but the keys on the Gazooba kept them fascinated long after shape sorting became easy. Gazooba teaches shapes, colors, coordination, and provides enough challenge to keep kids coming back to it. This is one of the very few toys I will put away for my great-grandchildren to use in about 20 years!"
2,One of Cary's greatest films!,"This is a must see for any Cary Grant fan or any fan of black comedies! Cary plays Mortimer, an ordinary guy who on his wedding night finds a dead body in the windowseat of his beloved aunt's home. The chaos that ensues is hilarious! Add to it Mortimer's eccentric brother Teddy who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt and another brother, Jonathan, who is a murderer who looks like Boris Karloff! Jonathan's sidekick is none other then Peter Lorre, who is awesome in his role! Love this movie!"
1,very disappointed,I just returned it. The image was so poor that above minimum magnification I couldn't even tell what I was looking at.It would have been a fantastic item if they had just used a better CCD. The plastic moving parts were very imprecise also.I gave it two stars just because the idea is excellent.I would gladly pay 20 dollars more for a decent image sensor.Oh well.
2,A book that fighter pilots read,"Very good. An excellent portrayal of a Korean War fighter pilot. And, it's not just combat scenes, the author provides many views of a pilot's thoughts, concerns and fears. Good insights into the interactions of various characters within the military hierarchy. The book has stood the test of time; it is still one of the best on the subject."
2,theamazonking,"This man has one sick mind, all of his books twists the history in his on sick way. I love the way he thinks."
2,Gift for a Friend,Didn't have a problem with anything. The delivery time was accurate. It was a gift for a friend. As far as I know he's enjoying it.
1,Half way there...,"I have tried three different tuners for my Zune, including the Belkin. Two of which connect to the car radio (FM) ok. However, I would like to charge my player as well.When I received the Belkin it was, or so I thought, the device I was looking for. Upon pluging into the device (Belkin) I was happy to have it in an convinent location and charging my player. However, I will not tune clearly to ANY FM station. Also, I now get a low buzz from the cars alternater.I own a newer Xterra and have not experienced this noise since my first car stereo 10 years ago. Too bad, I was really hoping for a killer product.~Disapointed"
1,Overpriced,"I have a friend that uses these cables with his X-Box and HDTV. Being curious as to if they provide any improvement, I took my MS HD cables over to his house and we compared them with his Monster. We saw very little difference with the two sets."
2,"Good diaper, but I still prefer Sam's Member Mark brand","I bought these diapers because of the incredible deal with the Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom discount combo (note: the price has now increased from when I ordered in June). The diapers are ""good"" in that they haven't leaked. They do not get 5 stars for the following reason: They are a little ""flimsy"". So, even if my daughter doesn't need a diaper change due to contents, she needs a diaper change more often because they lose their shape around her and don't cover her well. I did not have this problem with the Sam's Club brand diapers. So, although they were slightly less expensive per diaper, I have ended up using MORE diapers because I have to change my daughter more often. Other than the ""flimsiness"", I like the diapers."
2,Handy remote that does everything,"I had seen reviews from others on this remote and had been wanting to try it for myself. Most other high-tech universal remotes were too bulky and I wanted something that could easily fit in one hand. The ergonomics on this is perfect and can easily reach the common buttons using your thumb. It's also pretty easy to setup, took a little time to do some real complicated things, but I figured it out eventually. I love that it has a rechargeable battery and it seems to last about a week before it runs down. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Sepultura Heavy tribal Metal Mayhem and Mike Patton Too,"Seputura plays heavy, heavy sounds from South America I think, the lyrics are in english but the groove is not your typical American Rock, its a ""tribal Assault"" and ""Roots"" is definatly unique. Max Calvera (Soulfly) is at his Best on these tracks and You also get a taste of Mike Patton's amazing Vocals for a brief moment. Not long enough if you ask me but a nice addition to a otherwise strong album. Check it out!"
1,NOT WORTH THE 'JAILBAIT',"I saw 'Jailbait' when it was first on MTV. I was looking foward to a stupid, funny entertaining teen sex comedy. What I got was a stupid, unfunny, offputting, offensive, teen pregnancy so-called 'comedy'. I happen to like MTV movies- I enjoyed '2gether', etc. but this was just plain bad. Do Yourself a favor and skip 'Jailbait' -ROBBIE SCHEER, 15 YEARS OLD"
1,Instructions: DO NOT BAKE COOKIES!,"I put this on my Christmas wishlist because I wanted to make bread, pizza, and cookies. My stone arrived in one piece packaged really well. A box within a box stuffed with packing peanuts within a box filled with dense paper. Upon reading instructions, you cannot bake items with a high fat content such as cookies."
1,Beware!,"My DCC-1200 failed after 7 months, will no longer brew coffee. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones as I have read numerous complaints from owners of these and other Cuisinart coffee makers of failures in the 2nd half this year (2010). The majority of the complaints deal with pots overheating, smoking and some catching on fire. Would not recommend this unit to anyone. See [...]"
2,Blows away Microsoft's Streets and Trips,"I purchased Streets & Trips with the GPS a few years ago and upgraded the software as it was available... loved it. Then my GPS died, so I decided to give the Delorme (with GPS) a try. The Delorme software and GPS is so much better than Streets & Trips. It's kind of like going from notepad to Word."
2,Good enough to keep me after it for 15 years,"The first book I read of Hodgell's was ""Dark of the Gods"" in '85. It was five years later when I finally found the first book ""God Stalk"" and I loved it more than the sequal. In the quest for her books over the years I've annoyed bookstores, dealers (who sell out as fast as they get them), various publishers and some poor woman in N.Dakota I woke up at 6 am whose unfortunate number was mistakenly given to me as a source for Hodgells books. I never been able to find even a used copy of ""Seeker's Mask"" on the internet. If you need any proof of how good Hodgell's books are just try to get someone to part with one! So read it! And write Meisha Merlin to make sure they print her other books!"
1,NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN,"The box lists this DVD as Anamorphic Widescreen which this movie IS NOT! Anyone with a widescreen TV will not be happy campers. I ordered this DVD a week ago and the website stated Anamorphic widescreen. I never order DVD's unless they are anamorphic or Enhanced for 16/9 TV (You shouldn't either). Today the DVD is no longer listed on this website as anamorphic, the error has been corrected on the website (not product). It is now listed 1.33:1. Partly correct. It is 4/3 letterboxed widescreen which means black bars top,bottom,right and left. If you have an older DVD player (not HDMI) you may be able to zoom it. If you have a new DVD player, blu-ray or HDMI DVD, too bad.The movie was excellent, imaginative, and magical. Nothing like I expected. It gets a 4 1/2 rating. The musically score really adds to the movie."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"You definitely get what you pay for here... Junk total junk. Sure it's ok if you need desperately to listen to a radio in an emergency but it's uncomfortable with those hard plastic earpieces, it won't receive an AM station unless it's 10 megawatts and if you jump on a treadmill it turns to pure whining static and noise! You'll end up throwing them out just like I did."
2,The movie that flies!,Chrisopher Reeve stars as the Man of Steel as he tries to save California from a devastating earthquake caused by Lex Luthor. Discover the origin of Superman and see his first rescues
1,Item not received,I never received the item nor was informed that it was not coming. The item was supposed to have been lost in the mail and I have been promised a refund.
2,Worthwhile Read for New Perspectives,"For the price, this is a worthwhile book that presents a different perspective on politics and current events. Just be warned this is not an objective treatment on the science or implementation of propaganda. I was looking for a book that explored how propaganda works and is managed. Instead, the author spends a lot of time criticizing policy and those he considers the power elite. I appreciate the author's point of view but tend to discount criticism that doesn't come with proposed solutions, examples, supporting data and facts."
1,This version is made in China,"Not that it is a piece of junk, but it isn't the SOG that people are expecting. I held one today, and for $40+ it is ok, but to make people think that this is a $100+ knife marked down to $40-ish without saying why (because it is now made in China) is deceiving."
2,Career Opportunities - A Fun 80's sleeper with nostaligia!,"As John Hughes movies go, this is as good as the best of them. Jimmy who lets everything slide off his back and models himself to be everything he isnt, is fun to watch and reminds me of all the times I wanted to pump myself up to be larger than what I was. Jennifer Connely is great, and there is a cameo by John Candy that is one of the films funniest moments. There is something about this movie that captures a piece of the eighties, and that makes it enjoyable as well. This is one of those films that get you in a good mood when you need it."
1,Do not get in plastic bottles!,"Jojoba oil is awesome stuff, but do not buy it in plastic bottles. Personal care products are a major source of phthalates, which are endocrine disruptors, and can help promote thyroid problems, diabetes, etc. Phthalates are in plastics, and phthalates leach into oils. Any jojoba oil in a plastic bottle will be choke full of phthalates. Buy Jojoba in glass containers. La Ronna is a good source for this."
1,Very bad!,"The one I got has a short in the input jack and I have to bend the cord under the pedal, but it works and I love the foot pedal!"
1,"""Being There"" revisited","I purchased the DVD to have it in my collection of films worth owing. I enjoyed the film even more than the first time I saw it. A good book and an even better film. It does not happen often. However, the quality of the DVD is very poor indeed. Every so often the picture stops, then it defragments in little squares like a Cubistic painting. I am not sure that the DVD is an original or a copy of the original.Even the wrapping and the picture on the box seem suspect."
2,awesome product,"I just got a iPod video its awesome! it can hold so many songs. i downloaded all my songs on my cds and it still had lots of space. first, though, it comes with plastic covering. DO NOT PEEL THAT OFF! it can protect your screen and iPod from many scratches! Another suggestion, get a case. i think you should buy this iPod video. don't buy the nano. it stinks!"
1,Poor Pretty Leslie,"Leslie Uggams is another tragic example of multi-talented beautiful black female entertainers who face institutionalized racial discrimination in Hollywood. Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, and Eartha Kitt had to sing for their supper. Halle Berry hasn't had a decent role in years while her aging peers - Nicole Kidman, Meg Ryan, and Julianne Moore - continue to flourish. Is there any movie that Kidman HAS NOT been in? Surely her long run is the result of a backroom deal - the Supreme payoff for keeping her mouth shut and not outing you know who!And poor poor pathetic me for watching EVERY disgusting minute of this tragedy while waiting for Leslie to do something other than look stupid."
1,Quite Sad!,"I was hoping that It wouldn't come to this but after listening to this CD from beginning to end I must say that this is by far the worst Blaze Ya Dead Homie CD to ever circulate through my eardrums. With the exception of about three songs I found this album to be an ideal way to put someone to sleep. The beats are absolutely horrible and don't help the lyrics out at all. Judging by the sound and all around content of this album I'd venture to say that Blaze certainly did not put his all into this at all. If you want to listen to GOOD Blaze, Just get ahold of his LP."
1,Disappointing,"The Regency Christmas anthology that comes out each year is a treat. However, this year, the stories are rather boring. The problem with anthologies is that there usually good stories and bad and one just hopes the good outweigh the bad. Not in this case. Boring, boring, boring and sooooo unromantic."
1,I got the wrong pen!,I was sent a different office talking pen that did not match the product description and had different quotes. Very Disappointing.
2,"An engaging flirtation, cover to cover!","I don't read a lot of Regencies, so I was delighted that THE CAPTAIN'S COURTSHIP was written with style and humor, without so much of the era's slang and mannerisms that I couldn't follow the action. Ms. Huntington kept the suspense high as I turned the pages, creating wonderful conflicts and a heroine well worth rooting for!"
2,Good Foundation,"This book offers a good foundation on Runes and the use of them in divination. Several methods are presented, in an understandable format. A good useable book."
1,So so,"Pendant size is larger than a quater making it a bit gaudy. The leather cord it comes with would probably not fit over the head of most children, so it's useless."
1,Crosley poor quality,"I received this item promply. I started to put it together, and had missing hardware, and defective parts.I phoned Crosley, and odered the parts that I needed, but they never came. I ordered them again, and they got here twelve days later.The poor workmanship, plus poor customer service from Crosley, from the time that I made my order, to the time it took to get enough, and good parts here, I finally got my item put together, and useable in about 40 days. I will never order another Crosley item."
2,What a visual RIDE !,"Bob Bralove has done a killer job of creating yet another wild, wayout visual event.Couldn't believe it when the pig was chasing the donkey, you could hear, and see every single note played.Into ""Aliens Alley"", I felt as though I was just released through the hatch of a space craft without an umbilical cord.All of this DVD is really great, and well worth Amazon's cheap price."
1,This movie is a joke,come on seriously? i couldnt even sit down and watch it.this movie is so pathetic. robert englund will always be freddy krueger.. they should of not even made this film.. i actually got pissed.. this movie has nothing to do with anything from any of the other films. it took a whole new direaction. and the actors and actresses were so fake and didnt even act.the original krueger movies he was a pedophile and was arrested but realeased becuz someone didnt sign the search warrent and he was free to go.. so the parents of springwood burned him down at his job at a boiler type factory. OMG. i hate hate this new movie and no wonder robert englund didnt want to star in it and this isnt meant to offend anyone but if you like the movie IM SORRY ...you must not be familiar with the other movies... lol
2,"Funny, funny, funny","This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I passed it along to my sister, who passed it to a friend, and on down the list it goes ...... I haven't seen my copy in months. I will want it back, though, as it is one of those rare books that I enjoyed so much that I'll read it again. Hilariously funny. Not for the delicate."
2,Works,We have used this product for some time and it has never failed to do the job. I always like to keep some on hand.
2,Shimano cassette,"We put this on my wife's Trek 1.5 WSD, we also put on a longer chain. Where we live there are many hills/mountains and the lower gears really work great. Great value for the money."
2,Importance on the concept of citizen rights,"While we are protesting for more rights and priviledges in our society, it's worth to take into consideration that what is meant by citizen rights and a more important concept, citizenship, which is always neglected by many liberalists and human rights concern groups. The book gives a clear and comprehensive outline on the concept of citizenship,the possible conflicts between rights and duties."
1,I DON'T want this DVD...,"At 48 mins,with grainy picture and mono sound - even though several of these tracks were originally in stereo - this DVD is a waste of time, unless you are a fanatical collector... This volume plus #2 together on one DVD might just be worth $. The idea is a good one though, as there currently seem to be no pop/rock music omnibus collections in the vein of ""Now That's What I Call Music"" on DVD."
1,COULDN'T COMPARE WITH THE CHRISTMAS SHOES,"I was sadly disappointed with this dvd. It was a waste of money and time. You cannot compare this with ""TheChristmas Shoes""."
2,Una buena novela fallida,"Esta es la segunda novela de Carlos Franz, escritor chileno que suele tomarse las cosas con calma (demoró siete años en terminarla). Se concentra en la relación que establece el cónsul chileno en Iquitos con su hija adolescente, quien llega hasta ese selvático paraje para hacerle una visita. Quizá lo más interesante del libro está en la construcción, por parte de un hombre, de la identidad de una mujer, a partir de las señas que las propias mujeres entregan. Como ha dicho Franz: ""He pasado tanto tiempo pensando en ellas, que no me cuesta tanto imaginar cómo piensan"". Sin embargo, el libro falla en una cuestión fundamental: el preciosismo del estilo mata un argumento delicado, finamente psicológico: a veces agobian las profusas descripciones del paisaje de Iquitos. En todo caso, una buena oportunidad para saber qué y cómo escriben los escritores chilenos en plena producción."
1,tru glo springfield xd,"i hated this product, it was the worst money i have ever spent! the front sight did not even work! rear wasnt that great either. i would recomened the truglo tritium fiber optic night sights if you are considering purchasing this item, they are much better. its worth the extra money to get the fiber optics!"
1,Disturbing only for die hard war fans,Only for die hard war fans.I did not find this movie enjoyable at all.The characters did not do it for me.
1,Not as Expected,"I purchased this for my daughter's nursery and was hoping it would complement the vintage rose pink I had already in the room (I was looking for a soft light pink skirt); unfortunately the color has more of a purple hue to it similar to a soft ballerina pink. It also is more princessy/fairytail looking then I thought it would be, an aesthetic I was trying to avoid. If you want to compare the color of the tulle, the light pink bridal tulle at Joanne's Fabric Store is the exact same color (I had some tulle rounds leftover from the baby shower). The third layer of fabric behind the 2 tiered layers of tulle is also a matching light pink cotton/muslin. I tried to see if the color of the crib skirt would change having a white or cream piece of fabric behind the tulle, but both colors made little difference, just a smidgen lighter, but the purple is still there. If you are going for a princess/fairytale or ballerina theme I think this pink crib skirt would complement perfectly."
1,Piece of junk made in China,"I bought this chime and installed it, It worked fine for a few months, then it became tempermental. If you pushed the doorbell sometimes it wuld work, and mostly it would not. Turns out if you pressed the doorbell on the bottom, and to the side at the same time, it would ring. If you simply pressed the bell as a normal visitor might, it wouldn't operate.I bought a seoond unit and it did not operate correctly either, same problem right out of the box. I took it back.This ranks right up there next to my GE air conditioner frm WalMart that cools but does not dehumidify.GE obviously does not care about its reputation to allow these defective products to be marketed under its once highly prized brand name, What ever happened to quallity control?My advice is to buy a different brand, and pass on anything made in China. The prices may be low, but what's the point if it does not function correctly? This product will only make a brief stop in your home on the way to the dump."
1,Horrible portrayal of a beloved comic book character,"I've seen some bad acting, but I don't think an ""Oscar Winner"" should act this badly in a movie. Hallie Berry, who I like as an African American actress, did a horrible job as Catwoman. Really, she was following in the steps of the lovely Michelle Phieffer, Eartha Kitt, etc. These women were sexy as Catwoman and they were vicious. More importantly, they seem to do it effortlessly. You could tell Hallie was struggling to be sexy in this movie when it should have come off naturally.The villain was just all right, nothing special.At least the fight scene at the end was okay. But the premise and acting leaves much to be desired."
2,The album that first got me hooked on Lloyd,"His lyrics are so clever, the tempo upbeat, the style fresh... this is the album that got me hooked on Lloyd Cole back in the mid 80's. If you ever get a chance to see him in concert, I highly recommend it; his voice is a bit deeper these days, but he hasn't lost his style."
1,Couldn't Even Finish This Boring Tale!,"If you're a Ridley Pearson fan, this one is a big disappointment. It just does not grab you from the beginning like many of his former works do. First of all, I found the major premise of a railroad being sabotaged by a man whose wife and child were killed by a train to be trite. From this point on, it's all downhill as the investigation begins. Sorry, I just couldn't continue with this dull tale. Read at your own risk, but be assured there are lots better offerings out there."
2,great movie,This is a great movie about love. But the sellers have lost their ever loving minds about the price of it. This movie should be no more than 9.99 at the highest and 4.99 at the lowest
2,Best Showerhead I ever had...,I should have had one of these 50 years ago..Works great and is simple to install...
1,Dont buy this item...,Maybe I just purchased a defective one but I took it out twice to use and both times had a problem. The 1st time I was no where where I could heat a bottle and when I went into my diaper bag to get it the stupid thing had already warmed and cooled so my poor child screamed until we found a place that would heat the bottle.Boiled it again figuring maybe we didnt keep it in long enough the 1st time and then put it in the closet. When I took it out to use it it was already hard..apparently it had warmed/cooled on its own again. I threw it out and desided to buy the 8oz cans of ready to feed to take out with me. This way my baby (now 6 months) drinks her bottle room temp.
1,Not impessed!,"I bought this film thinking it sounded really interesting, but I have to admit it is one of the dullest movies i have ever watched! The sleeve notes promised alot but the film delivered nothing. very disappointing!!!"
1,Caruso C97953 Salonpro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter With 30 Rollers,It didn't curl my hair as well as my old curlers which was a bummer. Seems for my naturally curly hair I need to blow dry my hair first and then it will curl from the rollers. I like when I can just roll my hair after naturally drying.
2,Buffy's Best,"If you haven't heard of Buffy then this is a great starter with a wide selection from her original Vanguard Studio Albums of the 1960s-70s.You'll take a trip through a variety of genres from her haunting Native North American Sounds, Folk Roots, 70s Orchestrations, Controversial Soundtracks (ie Soldier Blue), Nashville Country and Unreleased Bonus Tracks.The Ultimate Surprise was to hear a Remastered, Cleaned up version of her European Hit song 'Soldier Blue' from her album She used to wanna be a Ballerina. That alone is wonderful !"
2,Sailor moon is the best show in the world,"This is a great video. You should buy it. I just can't deside which is best The doom tree, The negamoon, or the negaverse. They are all great!! It's my favorite show. Don't get this if you haven't seen the 1rst part of sailor moon ""R"". That's the only reason you shouldn't buy it. Otherwise do it, it's worth it"
2,Love it!!,"fast shipment product exactly as described, would highly recommend this item to all...Fun and very exiting to use and enjoy"
2,Best book on RMI,"This is the best book on RMI that I have come across and I personally own 4 RMI books (about 10 if you count books that aren't solely on RMI). Contrary to a previous reviewer, this is NOT a beginners book. Beginners should get a more verbose RMI tutorial-like book. This is an advanced reference with very few examples, but it covers topics that you just can't find anywhere else, and furthermore, presents the topics in a detailed, to the point, lucid manner.There is no better RMI book for the advanced RMI developer who is wishing to learn the ""under the hood"" workings of RMI."
1,"cheap, writes well","This pen is VERY cheap. It feels so light, I worry it would blow away if I left it outside. Also its very ugly, and definitely will NOT win you any style points. It writes well, and consistent and you have to really TRY to get it to bleed (by coloring in the same spot for a long time). I don't like the way it scratches the paper. It feels like a cheap marker.Honestly if I need something that writes well and does not bleed, I'd rather just use a pencil."
2,Annointed,"Truly this is one of the greatest CD's that I have ever purchased. Not only does it minister, it is uplifting."
1,another bomb,"In the usual fashion of Stephen Coonts novels they take the best clip from the book to lure unsuspecting people to buy the book. Once you get the book though you trudge through page after page of slow and boring literature.. To put it into perspective, I am more likely to pick up my Economics text and read it for fun than i am to read Cuba. The book is horribly drawn out.. What could have been said in 100 pages has been drawn out to 390 pages. Guess I should have learned from the Under Seige. I recommend reading a book by a better author such as Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."
2,Shakespeare made easy,"The book,Young Reader""s Shakespeare: Hamlet, by Adam McKeown is a wonderful way for everyone to better understand Shakespeare's Hamlet. Mr. McKeown captures all the drama and adventure of the original play in modern prose, while still keeping some of the original lines we are all familiar with. He also has a section of frequently asked questions which he answers for the reader. This book is a great way to be introduced to Hamlet as well as a memorable review of a classic you once studied."
2,this game rocks!!!!!!,"This game packs plenty of dodge and shoot action. And it has action/adventure, so if you like that you will like this game. This is a good place to buy it I should know I have the game. Oh yeah I almost forgot(trust me on this don't get this game off of EBAY)... I'm going to let you know this but ""MegaMan blue vesion"" is a little harder than ""MegaMan white vesion""Salim ta-ta"
2,Best mechanical switcher,"This unit is completely mechanical and does NOT require power. That means it's not going to do any signal processing, which is what I wanted. It just passes the analog signal and nothing else.Switches are good quality, it looks nice (as nice as a switch box can look I guess) and it's got some weight to it. When you push in the buttons its heavy enough and has no-slip feet to keep the unit from being pushed off of the table. This is a major problem of the cheaper selector boxes.I'm using this as an input selector for my Parasound power amp and NHT passive volume control, which only have a single input. I was most concerned with this unit not causing any sound denigration. It doesn't seem to change what comes in (at least not that I can hear)."
1,Hate this radio - don't buy,"I bought this radio two months ago. Already the volume dial is not working. I paid $7 for shipping the first time, now I have to pay to ship it back to Coby and then pay another $6 to have them ship it back to me. All for an $8 radio.Very cheap material used, low quality."
1,No romance!,This book is not worth spending your money on. It lacked romance and not once did it mention the heroe loving the heroine it only mentions him loving his stepmother and his obsession with her. I wish i could give this book negative stars.
1,Incoherent ramblings from a pathetic drug addict,"I never understood the appeal of Ozzy Osborne. Then again, I could never understand Ozzy himself! His speech is so slurred, due to heavy drinking and centuries of drug use. His daughter is a total brat, his son is a pudgy roll, and his wife Sharon is a she-devil. At all costs, you MUST avoid and get Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dancefloor"" instead."
2,Good basic book about Jefferson... tad bit dry,"This is a good, basic book about Thomas Jefferson that goes a little bit deeper than an early reader. It's more of a beginning chapter type of book. It covers the basics of his life and is done in an easy-to-read way... but I just found it somewhat dry to read. Still, it's a good book for those being introduced to history. Nothing controversial in it, I felt like the author was fair.This book was recommended to me for my child's third grade history, so I decided to read it first before I handed it off to her. So comparing to many of the other history books I've been reading (a good 30 or 40 of them!), I definitely found this one a bit boring and dry. Which is why I gave it four stars instead of 5. But still, all around a good book that I could recommend."
2,GOOD ADDITION TO MY GARAGE,"USED TO CHARGE ALL MY TOYS, MOTORCYCLES, LAWN MOWERS, BOAT BATTERIESMOVES FROM VEHICLE TO VEHICLE WITH OUT ANY PROBLEMS"
2,My favorite collection of her work,This is a lovely poet. And these are moving poems. Unpretentious and direct.
2,Great!,"No problems so far, everything works at it should! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone! The price was good too!"
2,Music SHOULD be entertaining...and this is.,"Our household is LOVING this CD. We also bought Victor Vito and really like it, too.The songs are teaching our 3 and 1 year old daughters so much already, through repetition and rhyming. Very catchy tunes, and if you REALLY want to get hooked on Laurie, watch one of her many videos on display at noggin.com under SHOWS....since we never know when Noggin will be playing her videos, we can log on at any time and our girls can watch and play along with the videos. It's a great break in the day!We all HIGHLY recommend Laurie's CDs, and can't wait to someday see her in concert! The smiles she puts on our girls' faces are well worth it!"
2,You cant go wrong,I bought the canisters as a gift for my daughter. She was very pleased with them and i know they will last for many years.
1,1 Star is Too Many,"When I ran Norton Clean Sweep 2002 it took over my computer without giving me the ablility to shut it down. When it was finished hours later, I had to reinstall my operating system just to get my computer working again. Then I discovered that Clean Sweep had deleted every program on my computer and 99% of all of my files. It has taken me almost 2 weeks to get my computer working again. I got no help from Symantec because they charge $35 per technical help phone call which I refused to do considering what their software did to me. I have used Norton products before, including earlier versions of Clean Sweep, with no problems. This product, however, is dangerous and untrustworthy. I highly advise anyone considering purchasing this to at least back up all of their data first and then buy something else."
2,Head rolling tennis bag,Head Tennis Tour Team Travel Carry All Bag with wheels - 283268 - This is one of the best bags ever
2,Missing accessories,"The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"THIS IS NOT VICTOR CALDERONE AT HIS BEST. AT BEST IT IS THE INDIVIDUAL TRACKS SETTING THE GROOVE. AT WORST, VICTOR WAS TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK DOLLAR. NOTHING COMPARED TO HEARING VICTOR SPIN LIVE!"
2,Chilling Reminder,"Though I had read Eric Bentley's compilation of the HUAC hearings (""Thirty Years of Treason""), it was not as chilling as this dramatic reenactment of some of the more intriguing testimony. I wish it were on a CD instead of an audio tape, however."
1,"Well written, but a borrowed plot","Candance Camp writes well. I especially like her characters, which are vivid and not the same from book to book. I was really disappointed in this one, however, because large chunks of the plot are borrowed wholesale from Georgetter Heyer's The Unknown Ajax. Although Camp is good, Heyer is great. If you want to read a *really* good yarn about that includes a young man over his head in a local smuggling ring, try The Unknown Ajax."
1,sad,"Ian Anderson often complains in interviews that the name ""Jethro Tull"" hangs like an albatross around his neck. He particularly dislikes being mistaken for Jethro Tull, the historical figure--or something. This is understandable, I suppose, but the solution is rather obvious, isn't it?We can reasonably assume this disc's title song, or just plain title, for that matter, is not intentionally autobiographical, and certainly I would be the last to say that thirty is too old to rock and roll, or, for that matter, forty or fifty or sixty. By the time of this record's release, however, SOMEthing HAD gone wrong with Jethro Tull (the rock group, not the historical figure), and if you don't believe it, just listen to how excruciatingly awful the title track is."
2,Safety 1st 23 inch wood security gate,The item is good and serves the purpose but it gives you a bit of a hard time to get it set into place. Once it's set though it works great.
1,"Potentially very hot, but sucked instead!","I generally like some of these French-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic. Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind. This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust."
1,0 Stars..... Not Recommended!!!!!!,"My 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend's house yesterday. SHe had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt. After a trip to the ER and the Orthopedic Surgeon, she has a fracture in her growth plate. Need I say more?"
1,Not up to Mario Batali standards,I previously order the Mario Batali 11 inch slotted spoon that I'm very happy with but I needed a slightly larger version. The 13 inch spoon I received appeared to be unfinished from the factory. There are wood slivers hanging out of the slots and it doesn't have the smooth coating of the 11 inch. The spoon feels very rough and the wood slivers catch food particles quite easily clogging up the slots. I ended up throwing this spoon away after only about 5 uses.
1,Doesn't really do anything for morning headaches.,It's a good eye mask for blocking the light and pretty soft but the magnets really don't do anything to take away headache pain which is why I bought it... I had a feeling that was what would happen but I still use it to block the light. It is adjustable so that my husband can use it too when taking naps.
1,great image when works,"great product, I've always been a Sony fan but this product let me down, after 90 days the combo does not play dvd's, it just make weird noises and nothing happens, maybe I got the lemon, haven't talk to Sony yet but I know I'm gonna have to break my piggy bank.."
2,Worth It,"Phil did a great job researching material for this book. It's worth buying. Unfortunetly, Phil passed away in Hinton, WV early February 2003 while conducting reseach for his next book."
1,don't get this book if you want to be kind to your dog,"a well-meaning friend gifted me with this. I wouldn't even give it away--I am recycling it. Don't want anyone to read it and be misled about how to train your dog. Sadly the monks take a disciplinarian approach to dog training based on a disproven idea that you need to dominate your dog and be the alpha dog. Instead of this book get ""Culture Clash"" which is a positive approach to dog training-NO CRUELTY involved and my dog behaves beautifully!!!"
2,Kevin Smith's brilliant stab at a romance movie,"Chasing Amy is a 90s love romance in the eyes of Kevin Smith. Only he could com up w/a plot so hilarious and clever. The story is about this guy Holden (Ben Affleck), and his friend Banky who create comic books together. Holden falls in love w/ a girl, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), but there's one problem... she's a lesbian. So throughout the entire movie, Holden tries to win her over, despite the jealously/resentment of his best friend, her wild sex life of her past, and any other unpredictable things that come his way. The cameo by Jay & Silent Bob, a regular in all of Kevin Smith's movies, gave the film a humorous break from the romantic drama in the movie. It's a must see movie."
1,not Mac compatible and they don't care,"This camera is not Mac compatible, the Samsung technicians know it, and they don't care -- at least the one I spoke with didn't care about the fact that I was out $500. It states nowhere on their Amazon page or the Samsung website that this camera doesn't work on Mac systems. It's false advertising, and they're rude on top of it. What a waste of time and money, not to mention I can't get my video and still images off the camera before returning it. Who makes a new camera these days that's not Mac compatible? Samsung = so lame."
2,Drum Prayer is out of this world !,Wow ! This new release from Steve Gordon is really exceptional. I got it as a gift for the holidays and it just blew my mind. The orchestration and exotic insturments are amazing and the blend of vocals with chants from around the world really creates a trencendent sound. I've been blissed out for the past several hours and can't stop playing it. Spectacular and highly recommended !
2,Squeeze Coin Pouch,"This squeeze coin pouch is leather that is quality made has strong clasp closure, thin enough to put in your back pocket, they are buttery soft and even smell like leather, so you know it's leather. I purchase this for my husband and he really likes this coin purse."
1,The worst ep of all time - it sucks!,"Tom Petersson must have been on drugsbig time back in the '80's when he, (1)left Cheap Trick at the height of theirpopularity, and (2) came out with thisgarbage! The so-called '18-string' basshe used on this trash is really a tripleneck fender stratocaster with five bassstrings strung through the leads. Thevocals sound like two sick cats (TP andDogmar) moaning!"
2,Stunning,"I saw reviews for this EVERYWHERE saying Rex looked""fake"". So untrue. While he is not the best, he is betterthan somethings. It has better effects than Frankenstien, but people LOVE that film. But look past this one. All you have to do to like this film is pay attenion to the story. It is true, this film would have been better if they used the 15 piece Rawhead Rex suit(and Barker's orignal script) they intended to use, but it is still pretty scary. Any true horror fan must see this film.(Also, for more Rawhead Rex facts, read Clive Barker's Shadows in Eden. I highly recommend it!)"
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this book based upon the positive reviews. I am an avid reader and for the first time ever I returned a book based upon poor quality and even worse writing/story development.The main focus of the story revolves around the actions of Cassandra and Lukien, two of the most shallow and selfish characters I've come across. I couldn't find anything redeemable about either. Yet, Akeela, who is quite admirable in the beginning, changes everything (and loses his own sanity) based upon these worthless individuals. Is the message that beauty or physical strength are more important than all other personal traits combined? Frankly, the story made me nauseous.Do yourself a favor- don't waste the money..."
2,Great Kids Movie,"I bought this for my kids, & we all ended up watching together.1 of the few family movies that had the kids & adults all laughing together."
2,WORKS FOR ME,"yeah yeah, Led Zep clones, blah blah blah. If I didn't like it then it wouldn't matter who they cloned. I've heard much worse by newer, 'original sounding' bands. It rocks, my ears like it, end of story.[...]"
2,There are no words to describe this group,"If my house was on fire, I would save all my cd's from this group, my photo album and my dog. They leave me speechless. Truly."
1,Don't bother...,"When I recieved this item in the mail which contained 2 of these, one was cracked and leaked all over the inside. Now I would merely say it was cracked sometime in the shipping process BUT after observing the crack and the way they were positioned in the box, common sense tells me that it was cracked prior to packaging. For the price of this product, the time it took to ship and recieve, and this product overall is not worth my effort to ship back and get a replacement. There are plenty of other choices at stores that are readly available to the common person to pick up. I do not recommend"
1,"eh, not so good","Well my friend Jenn and I were reading this book and we went to Ohio shortly afterwards. It turns out, the author is wrong about several key things:- the tallest tree in Marietta is 45 feet tall, not 44 (I measured it myself)- there is no statue of John Quincy Adams in Hamilton's town square.- According to my own count, fords are much more popular than Buicks in Ohio. This is surprising, in light of the Buick factory outside Jamestown, but true.Beside these factual errors, this book gave Jenn and me many helpful insights into the flora and the fauna of this remarkable state in our nation."
1,Needs a plot,"It takes more than special effects to create a good movie, you need a strong plot and interesting story line. This movie was lacking in both."
2,Incredible Digicam Bag,"If you are looking for a camera bag, this one is it! We got ours nice and cheap at amazon.com. It has separate hand and shoulder straps, several interior pouches, including two that are set up to store 4 AA batteries. It offers plenty of protection so that stuff doesn't spill out--the bag's cover is fastened with a velcro strap, and over this you can fasten a buckle that adds a second layer of protection. The main inside compartment (where you will store the digicam) comes with a moveable/removeable boundary that you can adjust so that however wide your digicam is, it will not bounce around. These guys thought of everything! This bag is well built, with what looks like very strong, water-resistant materials, and should last a very long time!"
2,arp_review,I bought the car seat about a month ago. I like the seat very much. It is easy to install it and use it.I like it from the safety point.Overall I am happy with this product and also its cost.
2,I should move to Sardinia,Didn't really like sardines much till I found these. Now I eat them all the time with salad and walnut oil dressing. Hope they come back in stock soon.
2,Great Pen,"I agree with the previous review about only one pencil lead at a time and the eraser, however, I have yet to find a 'nice' mechanical pencil with a worthwhile eraser. The pen works great and I am going to order another as, unfortunately, my first one was lost."
1,Norton-Never Again!!!,"Update: I wish I had accessed this site before buying the downgrade. PFW 2003 worked fine and I have reinstalled it. All of the negative review problems happened to me. I have had problems with Windows since deleting PFW 04 and may have to reinstall. One reviewer asked how a great company with great products could go so wrong so fast. They probably moved production to low-cost Asian facilities, there are signs of this in the writing of the manual and the kirtypirty and hoolyhootoo flaws in the programming. I will never buy a NEW Norton ""upgrade"" again!!!"
1,lousy product,"The first Deni slicer ran about 10 min and then striped a plastic gear and then the blade stopped I called the mfg and was told to ship it back 15.00 shipping they sent me a new one,i started slicing some beef for Phillie steaks when the same gear stripped lousy plastic gear on this machine,it's on the way to the junk pile as i won' pay to ship it back again, I will spend a little more money and get a good machine,"
1,Travesty,"Let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of experimental music--seriously. The Residents are one of my favorite bands of all time.But this mangled, mixed up mess is an absolute travesty. The flavor, essence, and sheer beauty of T Rex/Marc Bolan are completely lost. I suppose I should have realized what a hot mess it would be when I saw the cover, but I'm a big enough Bolan fan to give this a shot."
2,Body Ecology Super Green,I am going thru Chemo right now and need this product to help my digestive system maintain a well balanced flora. I am also using this product to bring my body back to an alkalyne state. I'm sure I can accomplish this using Donna's Gates products. I love Body Ecology and recommend any of these types of products.
1,Again a bad start,"to a series that has everything wrong with it.Guess expectation is the sister of disappointment. Bad performance, bad sound, bad direstion, bad everything."
1,There are better books!,"I read several books on finding a mate, and while this book had a few very useful tips, it's focus seemed to be more on bath-houses and ""campy"" humor. Save your money, here! 2 books to buy are: Husband Hunting Made Easy (Patrick Price) and Finding True Love in a Man-Eat-Man World (Craig Nelson). The Patrick Price book is #1 if you only want to buy one book. I used the information from these books, and have found my Mr. Right. Good luck!"
2,Fast-paced and exciting!,This is the second book I have read by this author. This one is much better than the other (earlier) work. It is a frightening mystery with many plot twist and turns - with only a few predictable patches. It twists down to a satisfying end leaving the reader satiated.I would recommend to anyone!
1,the beginning of the end,"As everyone knows season 4 saw the departure of wayne rogersand mclean stevenson, and the arrival of harry morgan andmike farrell. morgan is not a total disaster replacingstevenson (although I still prefer stevenson) but, mike farrellmay be the least funny actor I've ever seen. I don't everremember laughing at anything he's ever said. The show seemedto turn more to preaching and away from comedy during season4.It stayed like that to the end. stay with seasons 1 to 3."
1,item is described inaccurately,"Received, but was disappointed that it is Kwikset Security, not Kwikset MAXIMUM Security as described. There is a big difference between the two."
1,item not up to standards,"I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS ITEM, INFACT THE CHAIN IS ALREADY BROKEN!!!"
2,You can't go wrong with this lens.,"We just recently switched from Olympus to Canon and this lens was the first one we purchased. I have to honestly say that this wide open aperture (f2.8) makes a big difference. We rarely use flash even in dark rooms. This lens is quick, well build and IS is very useful. It's also very sharp. The 17-50mm range is not great but for portraits, around the house and landscape photography us enough. Our second lens is EF 70-200 f2.8 IS II USM and this one is our workhorse.I recommend this EF-S 17-555 lens - it will make your life easier in low light conditions and any other time.Don't forget: photography is all about to take your camera, go out there and have fun! With this lens you will have less to worry about when taking all these great photos!"
1,It Stinks,"Absolutely lousy. This is a photocopy of what was a marvelous original, and the photocopy stinks. This is unfortunate, as the content is very worthwhile."
1,OverPriced,"This book is completely overpriced.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved it but the digital (kindle) version should not cost this much.Good job publishers, way to ruin the ebook market before it really takes off."
1,A Waste Of Money!,"I don't know what those people up above were on, but this is the most sloppy book I have ever read. It looks like an extended version of a high school essay. The research, far from being complete, is hap-hazard and in several places blatently untrue. Though I agree that Christianity in general is a horrible pox on the face of the earth, I would have to suggest finding ANY other book on the subject... this guy obviously has an axe to grind, and his work suffers for it. A more personally-detached style would be necessary to make this book something other than an infinitely extended whine."
2,GOOD CD,"THIS CD IS very very good. i enjoyed this cd very much and i suggest you all buy it cause it is that good. the besy songs on it are break stuuf, nookie and re-arranged"
1,Again another hot cover but,"This series should have stopped with the season before this one. This installment of the series was just getting kinda pointless. The characters are kinda one dimensional, and they try to make it dramatic and real to life but they fall short.Save your money and get something more valuable. Again the cover is cute but thats about it."
1,Went through 3 of these before giving up,"The first unit we received had a defective fan. The second and third units were received broken. Not sure if it is a design flaw, but both were split down the back corner of the unit. I wish I could tell you how it works, but we never had a chance to try it. After the third return, we gave up on this one and went with a unit that was a little more expensive: Essick Air 697-500 Variable Speed Humidifier. LOVE the unit we have now and am about to write a recommendation for it."
1,Keep looking,"I am transitioning to tailwheel aircraft, so I am devouring all relevant information. I thought I would love the book, but it was average at best. A real disappointment, especially considering the price."
1,Another CD that only works in some players,"The CD wouldn't work right in 4 out of 5 CD players due to some kind of funky copy guard on the last few tracks as the manufacture says (BMG). Started to listen in my office but it messed up, thought I would listen to it on the way home but the same problem in my vehicle CD player. Worked on My living room CD player, But by the time I was done I was so pissed I really couldn't enjoy it the way I wanted. So it really made this a bad listening experience. Also the same thing happened to a Rolling Stones Exile on Main Street CD after buying music all these years (since the early seventies) and now not being able to enjoy the music on my own terms this is the last CD I will ever buy."
2,Motorola Cellphone Battery & Chargers,"Bought this product mainly for the inexpensive battery, total price including chargers was much less than others where the battery alone was offered. Of course, this may be due to the generic, rather than a Motorola OEM, battery, and cheap chargers, but for the bargain price, one can take some chances. Battery appears to charge OK when tested with AC charger, have not tested the car charger."
1,high price/low quality,I purchased this phone from a different retailer for under thirty dollars and was still disappointed at its performance. handset falls off receiver easily. sound quality was always fuzzy but in addition after 3-4 weeks of use all my callers suddenly started sounding really far away. only purchase this if you find it elsewhere for cheaper and hope to use it mostly for decoration.
1,Is it a fake or pre-used?,"This curling iron worked GREAT... the first day only. I was almost done curling my hair using this curling iron for the first time and it just went out on me. It would not turn back on, but a few days later I decided to try it again and it turned on, but turned off 5 minutes later. This happened every single time I tried using it, so I just stopped using it. It is awful and I don't know why a brand new curling iron would be doing this. Wish I could return it. I do not suggest buying this product from this buyer, Sorry."
2,A Staggering Work,"I had never heard of Sufjan Stevens. I did know that I am from Illinois, I have an odd fascination of UFO's, and this album jumped out at me solely based on the title of the album and first track.My my how lucky I was. It took me months of listening to even find my favorite moments (The baseline of ""Zombies"", seeing the predatory wasp for the first time, Carl Sandberg's query, the great emancipator... I could keep going).Very few people are able to write songs with such instrumental, thematic, and lyrical complexity and still end up with songs that are melodic and listenable. This work is extremely impressive across the board.I highly doubt he can re-create this effect for more than one or two more states, but if they are New York and California I would be thrilled."
1,size too small,"cover width not wide enough for lower part of chairs, no returns i think, so waste of money for me."
1,Two Stars for the Monkey,"I saw the first one and liked it. But, after watching this one, I feel as stupid as that Allen character. The scenes with the Monkey are worth watching, hence two stars. The Monkey was the only intelligent being in this film -- on and behind the scenes. Save your time and money and skip this movie."
2,FANTASTIC purchase,"This slicer is an excellent buy. My wife and I bought it so we could slice our own homemade bread, and lunch meat (as we like to control what goes in our food... no preservatives). I was a little skeptical at first, b/c the price seemed too good to be true. This machine proved me wrong. The range of slice thickness is amazing, from paper thin to inches thick. It slices with ease, and is wonderfully easy to take apart to clean. I would highly recommend this slicer to anyone who is considering purchasing one!"
1,"If you boil the water, it smells of plastic","I didn't even bother to return it but the one I got was unusable. The cattle itself smells of plastic, if you leave water there and boil it later, the water smells of plastic a lot and even if you rinse the cattle and then fill it with fresh water that you boil right away, you can still smell the plastic from the water afterwards. And if that was not a problem, you have to unplug it before you can move it (or you are limited to the length of the cord) which might not be clear from the description or the picture.I though that smell of plastic could go away after you start using it. It didn't even after I used it 20-30 times so I decided it would probably never go away. Then I got a metal cattle for the same price from Costco. Problem solved."
1,Bad acting and a silly script,"Bad acting and a silly script are only two of the problems with this film. It's hard to convert a comic book hero to the big screen, and for every one that succeeds (Spiderman, X-men, Batman) there are two or more that fail (Green Lantern, Green Hornet, Thor, Captain America, Fantastic Four, the Hulk) and that's especially true when the comic character is complex (Ghost Rider).Bottom line - this film will appeal only to the most hard core comic book fans, and even some of them might be disappointed."
2,very happy3,I love this soundtrack it contains songs that are classic hits done by new artists (at the time) with a refreshing twist yet the esscence of the original song. Love it!! The product was as described by the seller and arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.
1,Sony Projection TV,"Sony 57"" model: KP-57WS500Very poor quality; Started having problems after 1 year. After 1-1/2 year, the technician came out and charged me $200 to adjust two screws and tell me all the CRT tubes (guns) were going out. I can't even find reference to a warranty in the owner's manual. I tried the Sony web site, and that was a joke. In closing, it seems that Sony products are suffering substantial quality issues, and I whole-heartedly would advise anyone interested in electronics to avoid the Sony namebrand. Calls and E;mails were not returned. Sony did not stand behind it's product."
1,Cd Would Have Been Great&#65533;,"Make sure that you check your compilation right when you leave the store. When I purchased this CD after seeing Dio this summer on tour, I opened the CD and there were two of the second discs. Not 1 and 2. Just be careful. Other than that it sounds like a great CD. I like the one I have, but got neglected on some of the earlier Ronnie stuff."
1,This Game [stinks]!,The only reason i gave it 2 stars are because of the graphics. THEY ARE AMAZING! Even though the graphics are amazing dont buy it because there are only 2 modes to play in- Exhibition and royal Rumble! That [Stinks]! You are A Billion Times Better Off Buying No Mercy and/or Smackdown 2
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Bad story, bad acting... even worse inputs of comedy. Not true to the real story. Have more fun flushing four one-dollar-bills down the toilet then renting this ""movie""."
2,Reebok Extreme Step,"I really enjoyed this video because it's so different than the usual step routines. It is basically an interval workout where you do a very aerobic phase and then recover. It's very challenging, but not so hard that you can't finish the workout. The choreography is simple and Gin Miller is a great instructor and cues well so you won't find yourself stumbling all over the place. The music is a little boring, but the workout itself is the perfect length, 30 minutes.Paige Perkerson, Cardio Fitness Host"
1,Not comfy on a bony butt. 185 lbs,This is still better than the stock seat that came with my mountain bike but it still hurts. It's not soft at all. I have a bony butt hence it is important that my posterior hip bones don't dig in the seat to hard. This seat did not do it one bit. I am very disappointed in it. 20 minutes into the ride my butt hurts almost as bad as the stock seat.
1,Tar pit piece of junk.,"Where to start? It's incredibly awkward, unreliable (service dips in and out at T-Mobile's convenience!), and overpriced. My email service just stops working for months on end every so often and ALL the settings are as they should be!It's also endorsed by a rapper, that should be your first sign!T-Mobile is truly the AOL of cell phone service. To them, you are just a whore for their stockholders. I actually had a customer service rep tell me that in the area of my house I would get poor service in my home, but not ouside. What the hell kind of thing is that to admit out loud?!? Hopefully they will fold as a company sooner than later, I doubt anybody would miss them! Do your life a favor and go with Verizon, even their slum phones work 99% of the time with no issues!"
2,wonderful for a not-YA reader,"My son was reading this in his 8th grade English AP class and thought I would like it... and boy, did I! I read it in one sitting basically, and completely devoured it.We care about Bella and Edward, we want them to be happy, yet circumstances are at an impasse as to whether they CAN be together.DOn't miss it, totally engrossing even for adults!"
1,not that great,"This is not one of my favorite workout videos in the world. It is sort of annoying. She does it with this one other guy who is very muscular and looks like he just got at of high school Kathy and him, whos name is Michael, treat each other like they are high school swwethearts. One thing that I like about it though, is that they show the exercises in three different levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. That way you can work at your own pace. I never really feel like I have exercised very much when I use this video, though."
2,An excellent beginner's guide to Christian spiritual life,Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster is an excellent starting point for those brave travelers who wish to travel deeper into the forests of Christian Spirituality. Mr. Foster introduces us briefly to what each path holds; all the while showing us practical steps we can take to get us started in each area. This book is exceptional as an introductory not only because it gets us started down the path but because it calls us deeper and deeper in. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all Christians; and to all those interested in the life lived in and by the Spirit.
2,Great for organizing,No frills. Use for triangular hangers only. Installation is simple. Made of plastics and hopefully will last long. Will update later if it breaks too soon
2,Nice flower press,"Nice flower press. Works well, just takes some experimenting to see what works best. Fun craft project, good quality item."
1,Catty and only marginally interesting,"Cat fights set up like Joan Collins versus Linda Evans, brief cultural references, and then back to more back-biting plotting and night time soap stock plots. Two stars only because of some of the facts gleaned. A huge disappointment."
1,Check out the individual reviews of these books,The TCP/IP book is good The IIS4 Books is useless The Proxy Server 2 Book is useless The Windows 95 Book is alright - plus you shouldn't be taking the 95 test anyway. You should take the NTW test instead.STAY AWAY from this set. THE CORE PACK is good. THE ELECTIVES PACK IS USELESS!
1,Recycled Corporate Crap,"A little known fact - This CD was actually reproduced. It was remade because coldplay thought the original CD ""didn't sound like coldplay"". I'm sure the original tapes were Solid Gold material but it probably scared the record company to death. shame for having a soul.I was a huge fan of coldplays first two records. But trust me, there is no song on this cd you'll want to listen to more than 5 times.I promise you, one year from today, you'll have forgotten you've ever bought this cd. This is not good material. Trust me and save your money, or don't trust me and find out after about 3 listens through."
1,Not really for a beginner,"I don't consider myself a beginner in that my fitness level is around the average range, I am a little on the uncoordinated side and I couldn't keep up with this. Kathy doesn't slowly walk you through the steps and neither are they simple steps, so if you are looking for something for that is for uncoordinated people like myself, this would not be the video for you."
2,"Good dictionary, once you learn the quirks","The dictionary itself is quite good, offering multiple uses of words in context. It's also easy to use. The caveats: read the instructions when installing! I didn't, and had to reinstall. Second, it can interact and interfere with the cut-and-paste function (actually, anything using the Microsoft clipboard.) Once you learn those quirks and how to handle them, the dictionary is an asset."
1,Not a do it yourself guide,"This book is good for parents of kids who are new to or in speech therapy but, it's not a do it yourself guide. I was hoping to, teach my child how to say it right. This book gives some background and helps a tiny bit but, it didn't help in the least with teaching my daughter how to say her ""r"" sounds properly. On the speech therapy I go. Save the 10$ to apply to your deductible unless you just really want to learn more about speech problems."
2,This book is fun,"My 2 year old loves this book. I don't let him look at it by himself as I fear it would not last, but he wants it read to him several times a week (and he has about 100 books)! I let him operate many of the flaps now that it is a little broken in and he thinks they are hillarious. The little flashlight at the end of the book keeps him guessing. We always turn out the light and he puts his finger over the flashlight to make his finger light up. It is a lot of fun to read, especially if you like the kipper cartoon series. Nice and gentle bed time reading too, not too stimulating. One of the very best of the kipper book series."
1,Not the very best.,"Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo SpeakersIt was easy to install, and the sound is good. I have a problem with a popping sound. Even when the stereo is off. One or both of the speakers will pop on and off, for no apparent reason."
1,good idea not well made,"as mentioned by someone else.the parts ofthe handle keep falling apart.and the cleaning tool keeps falling off.some debris falls through the bottom through cracks.but it still has been a great help in cleaning up from infants after feeding (cherrios, crumbs etc..)I am now looking for a different model by either same or different company, which does not havethese problems."
2,Great Streaming Video,"There isn't much I can add to the reviews already here. Everyone knows this film, and you either love it, or you don't. I do want to mention how gorgeous the video streaming version is...much clearer than the DVD version. Honestly, the first time I saw it, it was striking enough that I felt that there was something just a little new about this classic. I had never seen it like this before. Even if you have the DVD (as we do), the streaming version is still essential."
2,Great strings,I have been using D'Addario EXP Phosphor for more than a decade. I have tried many strings in my 40 years of playing and these are by far the best sounding and longest lasting. I can use them for several months and not lose much tone. Usually I just replace them because...
2,Obligatory book for brand iniciators,"This is a great book for entrepreneurs, marketers, brand managers and beginners. I used it for my brand management classes last year, and it's amazing how easy the student understand the concept.But it helped me to share some thoughts with very well established Brand Managers and Marketers. This book is very simple and straight forward. As it reads from the beginning, you can take it and read it in a short flight.I can easily recommend it for you."
1,Read the Reviews!!!!,"I usually read the reviews before making a purchase and for some reason I didn't on this one. Don't waste your money!!! The plastic cups are the worst. Egg yellows were solid and whites were not cooked, alot of water build up."
1,It's sooooo bad!!,"I really wanted to love this movie, but 5 minutes into it, I found myself checking my watch. I think George Lucas should apologize for making this movie, like he did for the second Raiders movie (I think it was him). Anyway, it was embarrasing to watch. The DVD? Forget it. I'd rather watch a commercial for doritos."
1,Ink Hog!!!,"This printer works reasonably well. However, the constant need to replenish these tiny ink cartridges is leading me to seriously consider dumping the printer, about a year after I bought it. I can't give you an exact metric like so many ounces per print or whatever, but, take my word for it, you will be replacing cartridges on this thing every couple of weeks if you do any small amount of printing at all. It is incredibly frustrating.Update 5/2009 -- the ink situation on this thing is just absurd. If you have any substantial sized project (like a few drafts of a 20 page document), be prepared to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges halfway through whatever you are doing. This thing is just useless if you want to use it for light business purposes once in a while. Do not buy this as your ""home office"" printer. I am going to replace it with a laser."
2,Turn boredom into an adventure for kids!,"Kids and families never need be bored again with this imaginative encyclopedia of activities. Broken down into sections according to the time needed to complete each project, kids can work alone or with friends to make a yarn spider web encompassing an entire room, create a personal cartoon strip, decorate a T-shirt, or learn decoupage, plus much, much more!Super collection of activities!"
1,Blech.,"What an incredibly bad and BORING book. I usually trust Roberts to tell a good story, but this book raised serious doubts for me. These characters are underdeveloped, BORING and I didn't care about any of them at all. ""End of the world"" - YAWN. I am not even tempted to buy the rest of the trilogy. And Roberts' habit of big, bloated speeches was bad in the last ""Red"" flower books; I'm assuming that no editor's curtailed her because it's just awful here. I just wanted everyone to shut UP with the big, long-winded declarations. And I'm annoyed that the person that, ah, not ends up not being part of the group, is that person. Talk about the final cliche in a book chock full of them."
2,Every Little Bad Boy HAS to go to Camp Green-Lake,"Have you heard of Camp GreenLake? Every little bad boy goes there. So be good. Now, Stanley Yelnats went there and was treated like a slave! If you go to camp green lake, you start dingin' holes like you never have before.So I warn you,! My brother went there and I didn't see him for the next year and a-half!!!!!"
2,Amazing,I thought this book was incredible. It was full of twists and turns and had great suspense. I read it a few years ago and still recommend it to people looking for a great book to curl up with ... just don't read it in the dark. : )
2,See the World through a Different Set of Eyes,"This book was so original! I picked the book up only because it was a Today Show Book Recommendation. It was very good. Mark Haddon is an excellent author. It must have been very difficult to tell the entire story through the eyes of Christopher, an autistic boy. By reading this book, you come to realize how these children go through their days - from their thought processes to their unbearable touches. It was a serious book, but there were lots of funny parts to chuckle over. Overall, this was a great book; a little predictable at times, but still very good. It has all the emotions of a good book - sadness, laughter, and joy."
2,Adult: Good game for Baseball fans or children,"As an adult I found the game to be quite limited. The music and effects are pretty good. I noticed an outright bug where on several occassions I have seen the computer get a double play on me and call each runner safe as the ball was thrown. Which is it? Safe or out?There really isn't much depth to this game(no stadium detail, no team level choices.. etc) but its still fun to pick up for a quick game once in a while.Pick it up if your a fan or for your kids."
2,GREAT RESOURCE,"This book arrived in excellent condition and great price compared to what was out there. Garage Band 09 is also a good resource, but it is very sad that this book is out of print! I own both but this is a MUST HAVE for those learning to use Garage Band."
1,Swiffer Company...are you listening?,"Handy to use and seems to work fine. However, Swiffer should have used Lithium Ion batteries on this product. The battery life is unacceptable and this is due to nickel cadmium battery, which no one wants anymore. I will not buy any more cordless tools or devices that do not come with Lithium Ion batteries. Swiffer....use Lithium Ion and charge another ten bucks. I would be more than happy to pay extra knowing that the battery life will allow me to do more than my kitchen. Just my take on the matter."
2,off the hook,The Introduction is off the hook FOE REAL. The music is very unique crafty`s style of flow is bad not bad in a horrible way but bad in a good way.I heard this album from a friend and plan on purchasing one for myself very soon. It`s about time someone put SEATTLE on the map.
1,doctor who,This episode was not that great. There are four episodes and to watch them you need to go to the special features to watch. It was poorly written.
1,stop the bickering and follow the rules!,"This Colonial House was my least favorite of all the House series. The volunteers were not well chosen because they belly ached and refused to make it an authentic experience. Some did not play by the time period rules--very aggervating. I would love to be a part of these experiments and I can't stand when someone wastes the opportunity.While still a fascinating series, I wasn't drawn in like some of the other House series because of the constant conflict."
2,good textbook,"the book is interesting, if you like and enjoy statistics, be my guest. if you are into mastering theory of political analysis, this is also the book for you. The theoretical part of the book, is very interesting, and quite easy to understand, no problems at all. If you have a hard time getting stats, do not worry, still you will be fine with the theoretical part of the book. YOU find a glossary of terms in the back of the book which become very helpful to understand any ""political-statistical"" term, you might be not familiar with."
2,Fun when looking for something a little different,"As the title says, this is a great movie when your in the mood for something a little different from the norm. The characters are great and easy to relate to on a 'day to day' basis. Some of the issues presented are not for everyone, but it should not deter you from watching it."
1,"A bridge too far..er, ..one movie too far.","Loved the first movie, seemed the most original thing I had ever seen.Really liked the second one. The third..well I left the theater after it was over and just said to myself. "" What the hell did I just see? "" ..Lord of the Rings it ain't! But I'm compelled to buy it to complete the series. And yeah, at least the battle for Zion was fun..but that's the two stars."
1,Nothing new from Mr Jackson,"Well after Drive, I really thought Alan was going try things on this album. Instead it seems he has put on effort what soever with this attempt. The critics normally love his music, in his own words, hes just a simple singer of simple songs.Well Im sorry Alan that just doesnt cut it. If French Fries were fat free is embrassing, if a Garth Brooks or a George Strait did a song like that, well all the critics will be up in arms.Its okay to sing old style country Strait, Jones do it perfectly, but just to do an album for the sake of doing an album is pure wrong.A very poor effort from an artist that should know better."
2,FatMax Rules!,"Another great Stanley FatMax product! I especially like the FatMax line for its easy to find yellow and black scheme ... stands out in my tool bag, plus the rubberized grip makes it comfortable to hold as well as use. The viewable filler door is great too! No more opening the door and spilling chalk everywhere to see how much is left. And finally a place to store the clip end so when you pull it out of your bag the clip doesn't catch on something extending the string and putting chalk all over your other tools!"
2,A good read !,"Definitely a good read. This book provides detailed insight into the planning of covert operations in Afghanistan, and some of the problems associated with dealing with the indigenous population of that region. The book is not centered around actual battles fought, but focuses on the day to day aspects of the operation. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with an interest in special forces operations."
2,"Madchen, Madchen",You need to speak German as there are no subtitles for this movie. It is really funny. Teenage girls wanting to orgasm. Never laughed so much in my life. Sometimes foreign movies can do risque subjects so much better than we can. A laugh a minute. Super acting by a very young cast.
1,WEAK,"I was going to make sure and post a comment on how bad this disk was, but apparently everybody can tell. This is a weak disk, it is the same thing over and over. The first one showed hints of it but was his first release so it made up for it. This got rid of the doubt. 50 aint nothin'. Give me the Game any day, and once Detox drops its gonna be 50 who."
2,Well Worth the Price,"I just wish the professor was as good as the process of getting this book.There was some high lighting on the pages but the book for its age was in very good condition.This edition of the book is exactly the same as the 5th edition with the exception of some of the examples.Will be going through Amazon again to get my books, wont be paying those high prices at the book store!!!"
1,the broken shoe strap!,"the same day I tried themthey broke @ the strap & they are hard to keep on your feet when walking on your lawn, i would buy these again if they were to make them more comfortable & extra durable!"
1,You Truly Can't Judge a Book By the Cover,"Sounds like a cookbook, but the nonfiction account of changes in food culture due to women's changing roles in society and the natural changes this produced in their expression in cooking is what you find inside. The book covers pre-WWII to the early 1960's and uses household names like Betty Crocker and Julia Child to draw the reader into a more detailed, gender-based analysis of cooking n American and our resultant ""Food Culture"".The book is exceedingly dry and the title is misleading. What appears to start as a tale-based journey back in time quickly degrades into a familiar feminist lament of under-appreciation and under-representation. The book even ends with a comparison of Julia Childs and Betty Friedan as ""pioneers"" for women - odd partners in the feminist movement. At 254 pages, it should have been more entertaining. But, I was fascinated to learn early cupcake mixes included dried egg."
2,Brilliant,"This show was wonderful on HBO, but now that it is on blu-ray it is absolutely stunning. I highly recommend you buy this if you like any sort of war or action film."
2,Great comfort,"I continue to find great comfort in this book. Just last night I started reading it again, after feeling anxious about a personal problem (receiving notice that someone is suing). The part about separating the Practical Problem from the Emotional Problem isgreat advice, all by itself. So, it's back to ABCDEF (acronym for the steps of the Three Minute exercises) for me. Thanks for the very helpful book."
1,Very poorly made.,"Very poor construction and quality. Very flimsy; barely took out of box a few minutes to find no functionality at all in the crane. Not durable, not fun, nor educational. Poor design, should not be sold on Amazon. Deters me from ordering similar toys.I have promptly returned the item, and am awaiting my refund confirmation."
1,Dead in 5 days,"During the first four days of its life I liked my Gigabeat 60. Its interface is intuitive, and the sound is good. In fact, I ordered a second unit for my wife. I don't play videos so whatever problems there are there is of no concern to me. The only problem during this honeymoon was that the battery was dead every morning. I assumed this was due to operator incompetency and wowed to plug it in every night.However now, on day five the unit is dead. Toshiba service does not answer the phone, I cannot find any helpful information on the web. They are both going back.at in Florida"
1,Great magazine terrible service,"I love cosmo and got this subscription as a gift but I haven't received half of the issues. The subscription skips to every other month, I never get the magazine before it hits the newstands... and when I have complained and complained and complained they don't do anything. They have told me they would renew my subscription for the next year, didn't. said they would extend it an additional 3 months. didn't. It's beyond irritating, doesn't make any since. And defeats the purpose of having a subscription. I am such a big, avid customer of amazon and this is by far the worst service I have ever received from them."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOW 0UT-DATED,"The belief that the G-spot does not exist is just as dogmatic as the insistance that it does! I suppose if the book gets people to talk and explore, it is almost worth the money, but every woman needs to find out about her own body, by herself and with her partner, and not try to live up the to expectations portrayed in this book - like the myth that G-spot stimulation will inevitably lead to a female ejaculation. Forget the super-sex pressures of sex books like this and just explore."
2,LOUD - best for outdoor use,"If you need a clave that will cut through anything, anywhere, this is it! These are LOUD, LOUD, LOUD - to the point where they hurt your ears indoors. The sound quality still manages to be musical, though - pretty amazing. These are ideal for outdoor use."
1,The 2006 Champs deserve better than this !,"Even if you love the White Sox like me, you won't like this book.As another reviewer wrote ""It's got typographical errors. It's got poor sentence structure. The author He's no John Steinbeck; his prose is pedestrian.""Stay away from 1959 and Beyond."
2,The Arctic Incident,"The Arctic Incident was a fantastic book. It was filled with love and determination. In the begginning Artemis Fowl recieves an email that says his father was alive and that he was being held for ransom. Artemis's dad had supposedly died when his boat crashed. Before Artemis can leave to save his father he was captured by a fairy. The year before Artemis had stolen 15 million dollars worth of gold from the fairies. Artemis ended up helping the fairies. He did this so the fairies would help him save his father. Find out of Artemis can save his father, read Artemis Fowl The Arctic Adventure!"
1,Vic Firth 'Pump & Grind' Salt Mill much to be desired,"Vic Firth STS06SM01 ""Pump & Grind"" Salt Mill, Stainless SteelIn reading the description of this salt mill, I selected it because it promised to be simple to operate and would also allow me to vary the coarseness of the grind. In fact, the mill is difficult to operate for anything but the smaller crystals, and there were no instructions included as to how to vary the coarseness, and nothing intuitive about the mill to allow one to figure it out without instructions. It certainly looks nice, and takes up little space, but that's about the only positive things I can say about it."
1,Some errors in the book,"While the historical content is acceptable, the author makes some blatant mistakes mostly in the photos. In one photo he shows the site of the Wilcox train robbery near a present day railroad sign dispaying the ""Wilcox"" whistle stop. However, the actual train robbery happened about 12 miles northeast of this location. The train tracks were moved 2 years after the train robbery and the actual site is along a raised abandoned railroad grade. Another errors is the photo of the jail cell where Butch was held in the Wyoming Territorial Prison (now a state park). While the building walls are original, almost nothing inside is. The whole place was gutted at one time and used as a barn. A reconstruction of the prison was done, so the ""prison cell"" shown is not the actual cell, but a reconstructed one."
1,it just doesn't work w/Canon XL1 tapes,"i shoot miniDV on a CanonXL1, and this deck just won't play the tapes without introducing artifacts every 45 seconds or so.on the other hand, it makes a great parking block for my Audi, albeit an expensive one.i would NOT buy this product if you aquire images on Canon or Sony cameras, as (by all indications) it'll perform as well as President Bush articulates (ie: it won't)."
2,Wonderful tale of the gift of purity,Beautiful book (in picures and story). It really shows girls (and boys) what a wonderful gift God gives us and how we should save that gift for the special person. Wonderfully told. My daughter (2 1/2) LOVES it. It is her favorite book.
1,Burnt out in 4 to 5 months,"Very disappointed; 1 of pair lasted 4 months, the 2nd 5 months. Based on Sylvania claims (and price), I thought I was purchasing a superior product. If you read their package materials, Sylvania is very careful not to make any claims for the life of the bulbs...they must know they have a short life.I spoke to local AutoZone; they told me they have had alot of complaints about early failures with Sylvania Silverstars.I compared Silverstar with standard headlight side to side while driving since I changed burnt out bulb in store parking lot so I wouldn't get stopped for a dead headlight. The Silverstar is only slightly better; not better enough to justify the expense of what could be continual replacement."
2,Old School meets New School!!!!,"All the music lovers at our house will own their own copy of this one, 'cause mom's tired of sharing! Those slick guitar riffs from Carlos that rock the house and bring out the air guitar in everyone, tropical latin tracks that make you want move, rap, soul and more... It's probably one of the most diverse CDs we own and one of Carlos' best ever!"
2,its okay,some songs are good and some are bad. this is a good enough review to be shown. it explains all
1,Leaks,I would like to say no stars.Bought 2 identical bottles so there is no anomaly here.Caps did not hold water at all.The leaking was profuse.After I decided it was junk I inserted the caps without twisting and it took barely any pressure at all.These bottles nearly ruined all electronics in the knapsack.
2,Classic Compilation,"Baby Bash's classic compilation, Before He Got to be Huge (Suga,Suga). A Must for Baby Bash Fans"
2,It works!,"Slimmer belt actually works! It definitely makes you sweat and is comfortable. Lost 5 inches off of my waist since my purchase 7 weeks ago. Probably could have lost more but this is without a diet. I am up to the 2nd zipper and yes its a great perk. Down side is it could have been a little longer, especially for those who are looking to lose back handles or baby flaps from c-sections otherwise, you'll need to adjust it up and down. The zippers could be a little less bulky as well for women who like to wear fitted blouses, but overall it does not show much thru your clothes. I recommend for back support and working out. I was pleasantly surprised!"
2,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Tom Clancy continues to deliver the highest quality of written material
1,Nao espere muito deste livro,"Se voce esta procurando um livro que ensine como montar um ""gaiola"" ou ""dune bug"", esqueca este livro. Ele fala muito sobre motor, freio, etc. Sobre a estrutura, ou ""frame"", so da algumas dicas de como procurar para comprar. Ridiculo ne !"
2,THIS IS THE BEST PUZZLE GAME EVER!,"If you like games like Tomb Raider and or Lemmings, you won't be able to walk away from this game. Though the plot is a bit dark the game is funny as heck.I spent hours playing this game (then i had to return it) so i bought it:). Abe's oddysee is probably one of the hardest problem solving games ever. And the controls are very easy to learn. You really got to buy this game.Though the game is in 2-d the screen changing graphics are spectacular! And the movies run extremely smooth. But dont buy this game if you arent willing to get addicted!"
1,Endings Like This - Nevermore,"This is a good writer. The ending, though, is unnecessarily weak. He serves up a plausible and detailed analysis of why one character could, ultimately, have been the murderer. He then incongruously shifts gears at the eleventh hour. His explanation for why the killer he finally decides on, killed? - ""There's no explanation, Jack ...""There's no excuse - Michael."
2,Surprised,"I was surprised this product was not packaged differently. It came in a nonpadded envelope which offered little protection; however, it did arrive in good shape thankfully."
1,Fun... but not fabulous,"This is really a bathroom book or something cute for the coffee table. There is nothing really great about the book (except the title), but it was kind of fun to flip through it. I read through it in less than an hour and tossed it (I have no room for it in my bathroom or on my coffee table). The book might be cute as a gift, however it's not something that I would put on my bookshelf and keep. I read all of the other reviews before buying it and I guess my expectations were just too high."
1,Westbend broke after 7 months of very light use.,"I am upset. The circular cutting wheel and washers fell off the main shaft, making this now useless! We barely used it, perhaps opening about 3-4 cans a week over 7 months. And I bought this only because I read so many great reviews--that said, did we get the one lemon in the batch? At $25, I expect more than 7 months of use--and I see the price is now up to $33. If anyone has a suggestion as to whether parts are available, kindly respond. This is very disappointing."
2,The Mecca of all recorded albums!,"Plain simple, this could be easily the best album ever recorded, just only for its influence. 40 years and still fresh and daring.This is The Beatles as you've never heard them before, or probably after (and the first ever album to have the lyrics printed in the back cover). Psychedelic, urban and extremely brilliant. Get this album and experience not just music, but a whole cultural movement.NOTE: Im not a blind fan, and I'll be clear. To me one song of the bunch doesn't work, and that'll be ""Good morning good morning"". The Anthology version is far superior and cleaner although the guitar solo in here is really awesome. Its just the string and horns arrangements and the weird farm animal sounds that seems very out of place. But anyway, in spite of that, this must be the most important album ever (even if by today's standars of music sounds pretty dull). Period."
2,GREAT BOOK,"This book was very helpful to me when I had to prepare for the TOEFL test, the only thing that this book needs is some CBT practice tests."
1,harlequin romance anyone???,"This book wasn't a bad read. However, for someone expecting a mystery, I found it 90% romance. Also, medievil life in Norman England was certainly a great deal more gritty than what is portrayed in this book. See Instance at the Fingerpost or Stolen Tongue for the real deal."
2,O.K. ish.....could be better,"I really like the bonus disk but why bother with DISK ONE it's just the same old single or album mixes which are available everywhere. DISK 2 has a couple of lost mixes that have not appeared on CD before and that's why I purchased 3 copies....here in Australia it sells for less than $25 Aussie dollars...and since it got yanked in some regions of the world not many copies were pressed so I fugure over time it might become a valuable rareity.....well my great grandchildren might make some money out of their sale one day!!!For Prince's next set of rare releases I hope someone convinces him to release his 12"" remixes of AMERICA which I have only ever found as a 6 min version on CD (Russian Bootleg) although my original 12"" record was much longer (about 20 mins I think).Being a Prince fan I am always willing to make contact with others...if you want you can contact me at tomwynn007 <at> hotmail <.> comKeep those 12"" mixes coming."
2,Good CD,It was great to get so many of our favorite songs in the same cd. I was very happy with the sound quality vs. some of the other karaoke cds that I have purchased.
2,fun fish,these are great in the water- really look like real fish swimming- kids get a kick out of them. Makes the pool come alive.
1,A long-time fan,"I've been a fan of BG ever since it first came out, but I'm sorry, Mr. Hatch, I couldn't wade through this novel (and I tried, believe me). This whole psi-power thing, with its elitist overtones, is not a good selling point for long-term fans of the series. Your treatment of Starbuck (the character that still sells BG) rings a little hollow and is not calculated to endear him to anyone. Please stop here."
2,Patsy Kline channeled thru Moby,I kid you not! Actually maybe its Leonard Cohen channeled thruPatsy Kline. Whatever you call it its Beautiful and well worth a purchase. The production on this album merits special mention.
1,I'm still depressed - weeks after reading this!!,"I'll make this short and sweet (bittersweet). Mr. Franzen is very talented in his descriptions of people, places and things. However -- this book has no soul, there wasn't a character I cared about, even though I tried and tried and tried!"
1,The code already used,The code was already used when I tried using it. I wasted over $18 on nothing. Very upset. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO LOOSE MONEY
2,Drip Pans,"The pans are nice and heavy. Suited the purpose but, they had to be revamped for the stove. I am sure that they would fit a newer stove perfectly."
2,One of The Best Movies Ever,This is a move that makes you think and the acting and story line is excellent! Jodie Foster played a fantastic role in this movie. A must see!
2,Selling Biotech Products in Today's Market,"360 Degree Selling-How to Sell Biotechnology Products is one of the best books of its kind. With 24 pages of selling, using clinical reprints, it supplies the representative with crucial ways to use third party selling. The book also leads the representative to use the many web sites available to supplement his/her presentation with the latest and most pertinent information for the physician. Furthermore, it shows how the representative can best utilize his/her Time & Territory Management and Routing techniques. Last, but not least, it teaches the importance of maintaining physician contacts and using phyician personality and prescribing profiles to tailor presentations to individual physician's wants and needs."
2,Better than ever,"After re-viewing this show, I truly beleive Twin Peaks was a timelss television experience. It resonates as one of the most creative, touching, frightening, and funny experiences ever created in the medium. The second season is at least as effective as the first for those willing to invest."
1,Buy at your own risk!,Purchase this product at your own risk. I purchased one and it cost me over $600 in repair bills to have damages caused by this jump starter on my car.
2,good book,"Received book almost immediately...enjoyed the contents. So far, this is one of the best books I've read on this subject. I wish i would have read this one first."
2,Couldn't find it,"My son could not find this movie anywhere, so we were thrilled to see it on Amazon. Looking forward to surprising him for Christmas."
1,Beach Music may be the worst book that I have ever read.,"So much of this book was unbelievable, beginning with the characters' names - Ledare, Shyla, Tee, John Harlan, Dallas - what kind of names ARE those? The scene with the four friends lost at sea for two weeks was completely unbelievable, and became laughable when the boys were rescued by holding on to the antler of a swimming deer that led them home. The scene where Jack was in the hospital bathing his mother and shampooing her hair because she had become violently ill;shouldn't he have called a nurse? It's frightening that such a book could become a best seller."
2,Very Satisfactory Transaction,"Seller was prompt in shipping product. However, the choice of shipping was limited. It took more than a week for USPS to deliver the paperback size book. I ordered the book on 2/12 and received the book on 2/25.I was charged $3.99 for shipping. USPS informed me that for about $1 more, I could have the book delivered in 2-3 days. Seller should look into offering this other option.Thank you."
1,Flimsy,"This thing is always falling apart. My daughter is 3 and has a 15 month old brother. Tons of little pieces. Not a good toy. Not very durable. Plus, if you want to really use it the way they say, you need to buy extra dolls. It just comes with a monkey. Seriously."
1,Very poor materials (Cheap particle board that cracks),"Screws stick out on top of stand and will the scratch bottom of your speakers.They attempted to mitigate this with very thin spacers provided, but they are inadequate.3 of 4 posts cracked under very light turning of the screws to attach them.Very poor design.Very poor materials (Super cheap particle board)."
1,Don't bother,"It is amazing to me what a publisher will publish in this day and age. This book is worthless. There is no plot. The characters are not developed and nothing they do or say makes any sense. It appears to me, after wasting my time reading this book, that the author's sole purpose is to pass her own depression and melancholy on to others. You know, misery loves company. Well, you will be absolutely miserable if you try to read this book."
1,Horror Remakes Suck,"The original Night/Demons was a classic 80's horror film. The 2010 Demons is a steaming pile of horse pucky. I really don't even know where to start with this muddled mess. But I'll try...1. Shannon Elizabeth as Angela, really?2. Eddie Furlong looks like a bloated reject from Fraggle Rock3. The most un-erotic lesbian make out scenes ever4. CGI that looked good in 1997on the plus side I liked the soundtrackAvoid at all costs"
2,"Good for Beaders, Embroideriers, and Quilters","As with all Interweave Press publications, this starts with a historical overview of bead embellishments including some beautiful pictures and samples.There are several stitches shown with many texturing ideas offered for use in the various projects. They start from simple pocket fringe to a wonderful Sashiko Vest - assembly instructions are included with this project.A chapter is devoted to designing for bead embroidery with discussions of how stitches effect the finished look of a piece. You will also find information on color.The gallery is actually two sections. Two pages are devoted to a few of the Bead Quilt squares created in memory of the September 11th, 2001, attacks. The other section is lovely in that it show a few of the possiblities inherent in bead embroidery.Overall it's an excellent book and a good addition to any beader's, embroiderier's, or quilter's library."
1,Professor White is upset,"This isn't my review. I heard Professor David Allen White, Shakespeare professor extraordinaire at the U. S. Naval Academy, last night on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. He was furious upon receiving the latest edition of this book to find that all of the notes and introduction have been larded with post-modernist criticism and political correctness. He says he can't teach from this book any more. He cites such nonsense as claiming that Amelia is the true heroine of Othello; As You Like It is about homoeroticism; yadda yadda yadda.He said that if Shakespeare were handed this book, he'd burn it.This review may not get published, so I have tried to contact the good Professor to post his own."
2,From a network administrator's perspective,"I read this book as part of my first course in a Ph.D.-MIS program. I thought it was a great overview and history of MIS, and provided insight into alternative IS management styles and strategies. The case studies were relevent, current, well written and interesting. I recommend this book for all network and systems administrators. It gives insight into what thought processes should be occurring at the CIO and IS manager levels."
1,Not matt black!,"The porcelain is decent quality, but the colour is certainly not the matt black it appears in the picture! Instead it's a sparkly lightish black, or a fake metallic gold. Not at all what we expected, and certainly not what we hoped."
1,Too long and detailed,I tried to listen to the tapes but it was too long. Lara's family is killed early on and the whole rest of the tapes (10?) seems to be about changing existing law.
1,Nothing out of the ordinary,"This was just another example of a history book that didn't need to be written, except to torment history students."
1,I tried to keep reading ...,"I finally stopped around p80. There was no character development of the two sisters (beyond one is pretty, the other smart) - at least by p80 and the knight just spent 80 pages trying to decide which sister (or servant) to sleep with - he still had not decided when I decided to close the book for good. This testosterone driven knight was not interesting enough for me to keep going. Jennifer Blake's ""Louisiana Dawn"" or Lisa Kleypas' ""Then Came You"" or Joanna Lindsey's ""Captive of My Desires"" were so much better."
2,Great book on worms! - Really!,"Well written book on worms and what they mean for the gardener, the composter and the planet. Well researched and very well written."
2,The Reef,"This story had all the great parts of any. Murder, Love, Love Lost and lots of action. I read it straight through. Would suggest."
2,"Blue dreams, black despair, red hot!","Listen carefully. That roar of approval you hear will echo around the world, anywhere that books are sold and badges are worn. Gallo's book will be hearalded as fanfare for the common cop. If you want to shatter the television myths of cop life read this book!!"
2,Probably the Best WWF CD yet.,"This CD has the most current entrance music for the WWF supestars. Many previous WWF albums had themes that were already outdated. This has the current versions of the music that are heard on TV. Some of the music does however seem looped and doesn't change much as the track plays. The best tracks in my view incude: The Game, Lita, Rikishi, Raven, Benoit, and Kane. Definitely a good addition to any collection."
2,Special sibling double feature,This porduct is just prefect as a sequel companion to the special 1930 Dracula/ Universal Horror Films legacy series - I heartily recommend it for back-up viewing possibly thusly!
2,Very Easy to Use,"We had not registred for this but a friend who saw that we were registered for an ""infant"" car seat (that pops in/out of base for carrying) said that this was a must have. In terms of portability - it is very light and very manuverable (can steer with one hand). Once assembled - it is very easy to set up and get the baby in/out quickly. Makes trips to the store easy. We returned our other stroller once we received this as a gift. We will be sad to see it go when our son grows out of his infant car seat."
2,good read,"This book was very good, it kept you wanting to know what would happen next. The characters in the story were interesting and different. A good read."
2,Very nice.,"These towls are awesome. I've had them for less than a week and I'm thinking about getting another set. Only problem is as a single guy I wouldn't need them.These towels are incredibly soft, absorbant, and even nice to look at. There are a *few* woven loops on some towels that are a little loose/pulled, but these towels for $30 I'm definitely willing to put up with it."
2,"Even if you watch it once,watch it!!!","First of all, I highly recommend this movie.Not because of the Academy Award,but because this is a good movie! Ethan,with work like this you WILL win a best actor Oscar one year.Denzel,You acted a fool man! With a supporting cast like Tom Berenger,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Scott Glenn & Macy Gray you couldn't go wrong.In a nutshell it's about a wet behind the ears rookie (Hawke) promoted to Narc, and ""trained"" for 24 hours by Washington. But there's a twist:Washington is a crooked cop.I'll leave it at that."
2,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: Dad and Mom had the great idea to go shopping for toys in the horse section. They found me a horse size Jolly Ball. The material is very easy for me to puncture and I have already destroyed one and am working on my second one. The ball is easily mutilated within an hour. However, even with holes and tears in the ball, it is still fun. I grab the handle of the ball and swing it around. I enjoy hitting myself with it and hitting everything else in the living room. These balls could be built better, but are still fun for giant Rottweiler puppies.Conclusion: If $20 for a toy that only will last 2 weeks sounds OK to your parents, then this ball will be one of your favorites for that short period of time."
2,Great CD but not his best..,"I agree with everything that's been said here but rated it 4 stars. I reserve the 5 star rating for his earlier work, CANDYMAN. But I'm perplexed as to why it isn't available thru Amazon. If you don't own it, you need to. It's one of those CD's that is near perfection from top to bottom. Lukather is no doubt one of the best guitar players on the planet."
2,"Very good, top of the christian rock scene!","i saw them live as flight 180, they were great, everyone has to get this cd!"
1,...irritating...,"When I first listened to 'One Heart' there was, or so I thought, either some dust or other debris on the disc because of an irritating 'skip' during ""I Drove All Night."" I cleaned the disc only to find that this did not rectify the problem. So I returned the disc stating that it had a defect. Well, it turns out that this 'defect' is also disappointingly apparent on the replacement disc. I am surprised that no other reviewer has mentioned this.At 3' 24"" into ""I Drove..."" there is a very irritating pause, however brief. I love the song but this pause is extremely annoying at best. In my opinion it nearly completely ruins this great song.I find the rest of the songs to be mediocre. This is not one of Celine's best offerings. 'One Heart' is good and the new version of 'Sorry for Love' is probably my fave on the disc, but the original version was much better.As a Celine Dion fan, I am disappointed."
1,Bad product,"We received the product in time, but the product had a crack when we received it. Cheap plastic.Not worth the price."
1,THREW it across the room!,"Ok, if you like strong women characters - DON'T read this book.The main character is written so ridiculously week, so easily fooled and manipulated, that I actually screamed out loud and threw the book across the room in frustration. Not only does she start out naive and rigid - she stays that way. After the third time she is tricked into a dangerous situation by trusting some stranger on the phone who identifies themselves as a legitimate authority figure, I gave up...Moving on from this series and Ms. Armstrong - forever."
1,i feel stupidar for having raed thiz buk,"This book might be nice for a pre-kindergarten reading level and someone that has absolutely no serious interest in starting an import/export business, for the others i recommend not purchasing this crap. This book will only anger you when it defines importing as follows ""Importing is, basically, the opposite of exporting..."" Ya don't say!? I'm still searching for another import/export book worth a flip, so far i've found my best information from digging through the U.S. customs website, better luck to the rest of ya."
2,Wonderful,This Dale Earnhardt Jr. good is wonderful. It has the coolest pictures ever and is just great. Words cannot express how wonderful it was. You get to see what other drivers think about Dale Jr. and also learn new and exciting things about it. It is great. Any Dale Jr. fan should get it and add it to their Dale Jr. collection.
1,The bandwagon trundles onwards.,What on earth is this rubbish? Is this what we've got to look forward to - complete tat with the name of a film tacked onto the box? Bring back the old Lego space sets.
2,Frieza's true power revealed.,"This is a terrifically piece of anime as you find out how powerful Frieza really is. All of the characters fighting have grown enourmously since the Namek saga, you get a real feel for how tremendous the difference is in their fighting power where one can dominate when the other can't even land a hit, constantly switching the leadership. Now Piccolo's strength is surpassed by Vegeta, who is given the power he thinks is of a super saiyan by the reluctant Krillin and Dende, who hurt and heal him, releasing a Saiyan's true power. But even then he's not even able to touch Frieza, who undergoes his final transformation. This video is critical to any collection of the Frieza saga, it creates the feel for just how everyone stands powerwise for the final battle - Goku vs Frieza!"
1,Not worth ones money,"Bought, Charged, Used once, died. Contacted company, They sent out another companies batteies (which I had to install...Big Pain). Again Charged, used over night, died in mid use, Recharged would not charge. Let for day. Discharge completely, Attempted to charge again. No lights, indiocating no charge. Attempoted to use, NO go. And all I was tring to use was a small 110 VOlt low wattage lamp. Never get me to buy from them again."
1,Provides Only a Spefic Example Included on The CD,"Does not provide directions for ""Step-by-Step"" creation of your own original web site. It continously refers to the example on the included CD so you recreate that website.Poorly written and confusing. Do not waste your money if you are trying to build a custom website."
2,looks vintage,I like the vintage look. It is eclectic. Adds atmosphere to our living room. The downside was that there is not a switch on it. It was an effort to hang.
1,Sounds like metal garbage cans falling down my basement steps,"I'm not a real big fan of Def Jux, I bought this album based on good reviews and so far I like almost any kind of alternative/creative hip hop ex.(Blackalicious,kool keith,busdriver,deltron,mf doom ect.) Some people cream there pants over this just cause its different,and I know some of you are thinking ""your ears just arn't mature enough to appreciate it"" listen kids I know good hip hop when I hear it and this is just amature lyrics with wack beats. Mabey if I was still taking acid and mushrooms I could appreciate it better, but iv'e been out of high school for 7 years."
1,Not Quite Worth It,"This is basically an hour long ""documentary"" about the band's first 2 years on a major label. By documentary, I mean that it's essentially an extended version of the type of on-the-road, backstage footage you would expect to be included as a Bonus DVD with an album. It's interesting enough to watch once, but really unless you're a hardcore fan this is probably just something to borrow from someone else and watch once."
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the first one a great deal, and lined up on opening night to see the second. It was...boring. Yes, there were some cool action sequences, but even those managed to go on too long, and the rest of it...talk, talk, talk, dance, dance, dance...yawn. This was a movie badly in need of an editor. Actually, it felt like half a movie trying to be a whole movie via lots of padding. Maybe if they'd tried to make Reloaded and Revolutions as one movie this one wouldn't have felt so...empty. Don't waste your money."
2,mother gone mad,Good book and would recomend to anyone to buy. It does help shed light on her murder. To me it is a must.
1,"The Movie is pretty good,",The movie is pretty good but so far streaming has been iffy. The movie goes in and out approximately 500 times!
1,Tuesdays with Morrie,"The book did come in good condition. But I ordered it on Aug 22, 2010 and didn't receive it until October 6, 2010. That is unacceptable. Will not order from them again!!! I only gave it one star because I did get the book and it looks in fair to good condition. If I thought it would have taken sooo long I would not have ordered at all."
1,Drowned in Detail without Insight,"Despite all the hoopla, this is a bad, bad book, which reads as if two dozen researchers had gathered every scrap of information on the first part of this century and then the most unimaginative of writers had just put them in chronological order and called it a history."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this program and expected to have a complete program, I subsequently found that the program lacked key elements to function correctly, I needed to purchase an mp3 encoder update to use the save operation for my music track costing and additional $14.99, I subsequently attempted to purchase the en-coder upgrade online, Magix.com took my credit card information and thanked me. I have not received any e-mails like the program promise containing unlocking codes. ""Note"" these codes were promised within minutes. I have made (2) unsuccessful telephone calls to Magix, still no unlock codes. I therefore requested an RMA number to return the program still no response. I strongly recommend against purchasing anything from Magix, Their Advertising information is mis-leading. Grady."
1,anti-Semitism thinly cloaked,"Carter has been the voice of the extreme left - Israel haters. When you have accomplished little and crave the spot light, what better way that to find a cause that will garner the adoration of the multitude haters of Israel around the world, the left-wing media, and the growing radical Jihad movement?Carter's book is yet another platform for spewing his hateful agenda. Don't waste your money... unless you're looking for more material to bolster and justify your anti-Semitic rhetoric."
2,Does the job admirably.,"Apart from the fact that it feels plasticky and light, the product does the job as described. I recommend to all those who need such a document holder."
1,worked great until it broke,"Worked great until it broke. Had it for about 3 months, always handled it very carefully, but then it just stopped working right... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird, and ultimately unusable. :("
2,LOVE!,We love this and everyone thinks it is unique. I love how big it is. I got it really fast and it looks great on her collar.
2,"This was the first Mrs. Pollifax book I had ever read, since then I have read several others.",The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax was the first Mrs Pollifax book I ever read. I lent it to my daughter and read another one. My daughter read hers and asked me to get her 8 of Ms.Gillman's books for Christmas. We are both very happy that I did.
2,The best of all!,"I gave my mother a copy of the 3rd edition for Christmas in 1968. It has been re-bound once, and the pages are very worn. After her death 10 years ago, I inherited it, and find it the best crossword puzzle dictionary that I have ever used. I have found wonderful words in it, so that using it has been very educational! I am going to splurge and order the 6th edition for myself for Christmas this year."
1,Not impressed!,Thought this would be an easy way to clean....I will be going back to chemicals.....too much work for very little. The pad came apart due to the heat and moisture.
1,completely dead,I bought two of these cables to have spares.I needed to use them a few months later and find out they are both dead.I should have tested them as soon as I received them.
2,AMAZING!!!!!!,"I could not believe this was The Queen. I am a retired singer and always loved Queen Latifah's music, even rap:), and as a gifted actress. I was amazed at the versatility and sultry sounds that came from her wonderful voice. My nieces are teenagers and when I let them here this CD (I didn't tell them it was the Queen), they said that it was good, who is it? I told them Queen Latifah and they did not believe me until they sat there and listened to the entire CD and realized it was her. They have a new appreciation for jazz and blues and see it in a different light. Hail to the Queen!! Music has an amazing affect on teens. My nieces listen to this CD constantly. WOW!!!"
2,HOOVER WINDTUNNEL,Great vac! Powerful yet lightweight. Bagless container isn't so simple to clean though. Very satisfied overall. Great price!
1,NASTY Smell!,"I was excited to find this product, and was hoping for something that smelled similar to NARS Body Glow. This was definitely NOT it! It smells more like old lady perfume that's been on an old lady who has been dead for a couple months. REALLY nasty. My two year old (and this is a boy who doesn't even mind the smell of his poopy diapers) got a whiff of it and said, ""EWW, yucky mommy!"" Now, that's pretty bad! With that being said, I do have to give it a little credit. I used it on my hair in the shower (hoping the smell wouldn't linger since I would be washing it out with shampoo), and it made my hair very soft. I can tell it would probably make my skin soft too, but the smell is just too disgusting to ever try that."
2,Keep extra copies,"If you like to share your CDs with friends, make sure to keep extra copies of this one as they won't want to give it back. You'll simply be hard pressed to find a better CD in this genre."
1,Just a Bunch of Lists,"I thought I was buying a ""family organizer"" (i.e, a family calendar). This book just had a bunch of useless generic lists with a nice cover and fancy tabs."
1,"it can be used, but the longevity is too short, only one month...","Yes, it can be used, but the longevity is too short, only for one month...where can I repair it? thx"
2,Great calipers for the cost.,"Sturdy metal calipers, just what I was hoping for. Came in a black hard-case w/ extra battery and small desiccant bag. LCD screen is encased in black plastic, though you may get blue. (observed both in product images) Again, better product than was anticipated."
1,Thank God he has only written one book,"People like Jim LeCuyer should not be allowed to influence minds - young or old. His perverse sense of human sexuality and indeed, all forms of human interaction, present a danger to anyone who reads his work. He has damaged many a young aspiring writer with his unsavory and inappropriate commentary on the world."
2,Love this,They performed live at our school charity event yesterday and I fell in love with them INSTANTLY! All the songs on this CD are wicked!
2,A Balanced Treatment,"The Tinnitus Handbook provides a very readable overview of the topic and some of the possible explanations and remedies. I especially liked the objective presentation of alternative medical treatments. The book could be improved by color illustrations of the middle and inner ear to make the physiological descriptions clearer. But, I suppose, that would have meant an increase in price. I highly recommend the book to those suffer from tinnitus and to those who live with those who suffer."
2,Fits my Dell Studio XPS fine,The fan in my Dell Studio XPS desktop started to sound like a vacuum cleaner. This was a direct pop in replacement. Very easy. It has a hi-med-lo switch to allow you to adjust the fan speed. I have mine on Lo and it seems to be working just fine. One star deduction for the lack of any indication which way the air flows. I had to experiment to figure out if it was blowing in or out.
2,Great buy,"Wanted this book since we recently moved to NH and live near Exeter - where the prep school is based. Good quality, as expected. Great buy."
2,Music by Jack Williams,"I first saw Jack Williams perform in 1999-2000...... I was working when I heard him start playing, his music, lyrics, & vocals made me stop working & was entranced ..... continued working but with a renewed energy ..... odd but great.... So finally having all of Jack's CD's that I am aware of is great....When Jack finished performing (so long ago when I first saw him) ..... he was as personable, deep, charming, thought provoking & as soothing as his music. A real down to earth class act.Surely, Amazon wanted a ""customer service"" review... so..... they had Jack's CD's in Stock so ***** (stars)Other music by Jack, ""Laughing in the Face of the Blues"", ""Across the Winterline"", ""Eternity & Main"", and ""Dreams of the Song Dog""Folksy, Rocking, Jazzy, Lively, Soothing, Upbeat, Soulful....."
1,Installation instructions is no good!,This product doesn't fit my car (BMW) properly. The instructions are not very clear and what I would consider useless. Will never buy again!!
2,Fun book!,"This is a great bathroom book, because you can read a list here or there, and then pick it up again later. Lots of fun, interesting factoids. Found one error though...on page 219 is a list of Cartoon Families, and it lists the Jetson Family as ""George, Wilma, Judy and Elroy."" but EVERYONE knows (well, everyone over 35!) that George's wife is JANE Jetson, as in ""Jane, his wife,"" from the them song. And, of course, don't forget Astro, their dog. Unless Fred and Wilma, and George and Jane both got divorces, and then Wilma married George and I never heard about it? Naaaaah. Cute book."
2,Green Acres - Second Season,"Green Acres is always good for a laugh - a bit silly at times, but still heads above any modern comedy. Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor were great in their roles as Oliver and Lisa Douglass. And don't forget Arnold the Pig. Relaxing and funny, I'm glad I made this purchase."
1,Fluff,A lot of corny emoting and boring conversations. The transsexual subject matter was the most interesting/intriguing part of the book. The characters and plot were borderline anemic. I was frustrated when some of the conversations seemed to go on and on. The town conflict was what kept me reading. I wish it were better.
2,great movie,"Great movie and handled well with equal arguments and funy. But had to pay thirdy dolllars for it, mainly because I should have search elsewhere,"
2,"Common insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals","Part the Interlink Books ""Travellers' Wildlife Guides"" series, Peru provides identification and location information on Peru's most frequently seen animals. This 502 page identification guide offers full-color illustrations of more than 500 of Peru's most common insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Enhanced with a species index, Peru provides up-to-date information on the ecology, behavior and conservation of the animals listed, as well as information on Peru's habitats and the most common plants visitors will encounter. With brief descriptions of Peru's most frequently visited parks and wildlife reserves, this handy, highly portable manual will prove to be an invaluable companion for appreciating the diversity and wonderful of Peruvian wildlife in their native settings."
2,good movie,this is one of my favorites. just a good movie to watch but isnt anything with morris chestnut in it?:) i recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good story line. i liked all the characters and the way the movie played out. i thought it was really good
1,fast lanes bowling,"Game is not what I expected. I am still disappointed with it, but I am getting to use the product to a degree. There is no help files of any kind, so any questions I have with the options menu and others go unanswered."
2,"Excellent writing, substance and very timely.","Every voice is clearly it's own. Each character could stand on their own. Fine work!Also, I always suggest ""Fly Girl"" to anyone raising or involved with teenagers. I look at that book as a ""guide to raising and being involved with young people.""Please keep up the good work. I look forward to your next work."
2,Time Well Spent,I first saw the movie before reading the book and became an addict. I could not get enough. I then ordered each book after the first and read them all within a few days. ADDICT. I can't wait for the movie to come out and am even more excited about the sequel!! I would recommend these books and movie to anyone that wants to snuggle up and enjoy a few hours to themselves!
1,It isn't a bad guide,I don't have a huge problem with the guide other than that it is not needed. The game is very short and you could beat it in a rental. They aren't any powerup item to miss. I got lost twice and the guide did help me out then but that isn't worth the cost of buying a guide. Go to gamewinners if you stuck instead.
2,Smells so good!,"I buy this for my husband ever year... and we still LOVE it! It smells so amazing! He always gets compliments on it, and it's not too overpowering. I'm super sensitive to smell (frangrances and/or colognes) and this one doesn't bother me at all! LOVE IT!!! (oh... and he does too!) ;-)"
1,I really tried,"I just couldn't get into this book after about half way into it I gave up, the characters are week, story line could not capture my attention. Don't waste your money."
1,A Poor Product!! Not Worth The Money!! Don't Buy!!,"I am embarassed to say that I have purcased 3 Litter Maid Mega 900 Models and every single one died and untimely death right after the warranty period had expired. I liked the idea of the Litter Maid even though there were some ""issues"" with it. Like clumping of poo on the rake that would cause it to go over and over again. Cleaning the unit was a nightmare! I must say though I will not be buying a 4th one after the failure of the 3rd one I feel like the biggest fool in the world! Whats the old saying Fool me twice shame on me! Well after 3 SHAME ON ME! I wonder how many of these are clogging up landfills across the country?? I won't be buying a 4th one!"
2,Book for my daughter,"When my daughter was in collage, she and a friend occasionally wandered through cemeteries to read the epitaphs. This was a perfect birthday book for her. She spent most of the time during her birthday dinner reading to us from it."
2,Great Sound,"I would highly recommend these speakers. They couldn't be easier.. basically, plug in and they're ready to go. They have incredible sound and I really love the volume feature on the speaker itself. It's perfect if the phone rings, you don't have to fuss around finding the volume on the computer."
2,Great package deal!,"I bought these locks for my kids to use at school. They are a nice looking and functional way to secure school bikes. I particularly like the interchangeable keys. The new rule in our house is ""if you loose your key, don't call home, find your brother"". They work fine, even my 6-year old can lock and unlock his bike.I almost didn't buy these because of the comments about cable size here on Amazon. If you have some zillion dollar bike you probably want a thicker stronger cable, maybe with GPS tracking and some of those dye-packs that tellers throw in with the cash in bank robberies. These locks are extremely strong, no one is going to break them without serious bike-theft tools. They will certainly deter any but the most ambitious, professional and prepared thief."
2,One Of The Better Troma Offerings,"This is a decent flick with gobs of 80's retro, it's not a great movie or a great slasher, but as far as Troma movies go this is definitely one of the better one's, the story moves along quickly and the rediculas cheesy dialog, outfits and background are a lot of fun, and for me give it a lot of replay value, it's not really scary, there's scarcely any blood, it's more of a cheesy low budget retro run on joke, but if your into the like totally tubular 80's you'll have fun with this one."
1,too hot and top does not fit properly,"Very disappointed...I can deal with adjusting cooking time and hi/low temp, however, the top is a big problem. Its too light and rattles and I have water everywhere around the outside of the pot. I put a heavy pot on it upside down to weigh it down and still had water and soup all over the place on the counter around the cooker. The top just does not fit for a proper seal."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when I received this book. I know I ordered a ""used"" book, but there is writing on almost every page--all over the page. What's more, whatever is written in the book doesn't even pertain to the play at all. Just some high schooler's to-do lists and even a page covered in purple stars and hearts. In addition to the writing, there were sticky notes everywhere that were marking who knows what, and the book in general was in poor condition. Frankly, I am embarrassed to even read this in public. If I find a cheaper one somewhere else I will buy that and toss this one."
2,Heavy Duty Flatware,"My husband bought me these on Christmas 2011, so I've had them for a year. I had read other's reviews about rusting, so I was worried about them, especially since we have a dishwasher.At first I noticed the quality. Never have I owned such heavy flatware! The quality is outstanding, they are truly heavy duty.We've been putting them in the dishwasher since we got them, and I haven't seen rust on them yet, *knocks on wood*. If I remember, I will update in another year."
2,good examples,Shoshanah Cohen gave a supply chain strategy workshop at a conference I attended and I received a copy of the book after the workshop. The book has a lot of good examples of what real companies are doing and I have been able to use some of the ideas in my own work. It is an easy read.
2,It's a good powder,"I like this loose powder but it is pricy. It is a nice powder but I'm just as happy with my Cover Girl loose powder. This NARS powder goes on smooth & looks fab though, no complaints here. It is a finer powder than your drug store powders, if that matters to you. I recommend it."
2,Very nice faucet,"I recently remodeled one of my bathrooms and decided to replace the faucet and fixtures with the ones with vibrant brushed bronze from Kohler. As you can see in the sample picture, the faucet looks rather simple. However, its color and appearance definitely added some nice touch to our new bathroom. One downside is its rather high price, but I wouldn't be replacing this one for a long time."
1,"....Y como dijo la cancion, ""POR QUE?""","Este cd contiene canciones NO EN SU ESTADO ORIGINAL DE GRABACION POR LOS ORIGINALES ARTISTAS. No ay como las canciones viejitas pero con el sonido original. Desafortunadamente, este cd no es asi.....Bueno, pues ya minimo aprovecho para saludar a mis parientes alla en VICTORIA DE CORTAZAR, GUANAJUATO desde aqui, CHICAGO......SALUDOS!!! ~DJ LUPE AYALA"
2,Why is this book out of print?,"This is one of the best publications on the Aztecs, a major historical source that is accessible and fascinating. University of California Press made a mistake by including color illustrations and giving this a high price. It was always pricey for assignment for college classes, and now its out of print. It would have been better to give up the color illustrations and lower the price. But in any case this book it is worth looking at for anyone interested in the Aztecs, Mesoamerica, or native American cultures."
1,too short & low budget,This adaptation has 2 problems; it is too short. The first part with Jane's childhood and her aunt can have a whole chapter. The second at Lowood school needs another whole chapter. Important literary characthers like Mr. Brocklehurst & Miss.Temple are barely seen or left out.This novel has a lot of psicological evolution with Jane and Mr.Rochester that simply needs more screen time.Second problem is a modest or low budget;cinematography is too dark and poor. Few fill and background light is used so characthers are not separated from the background.
1,Region 2,"The Connie and Carla DVD is a region 2, a video intended to be played on DVD players in Europe, something I didn't know. I would like to return it because it doesn't work on my player or most players in the USA. The region 2 category should have been more clearly explained. Why sell it in the US when it won't work? I tried to contact the sellers but got no response.Tracy Bouvier"
1,"Great video, extremely poor translation.","I have fifty years of fluent Japanese in reading, writing, speaking. The subtitles are without doubt very very very poor. You cannot achieve a sense of the dialogue , and therefore the action, by the miserable subtitles. Thevideo transfer, impeccable, the subtitles miserable and confusing. Buy only if you are fluent, and turn the subtitle off. Fortunately, I can enjoy this."
1,Terrible,"I spent hours trying to get my computer to recognize this thing and was finally able to get it sort of installed, though I realized at that point that you can't scan from a multifunction device through it - you have to plug the printer back into the computer via USB to scan. I did this and then went back to wireless, only to find that it had corrupted the printer driver, so I had to download and reinstall a fresh copy of the printer driver to get the printer to work at all. After that I stopped using the print server and in the meantime switched internet providers and had a new router and wireless network. Today I decided to try the print server again with the new router/network, but I'm having the same problems with installation (it says it can't find the print server even though they are connected by ethernet cable and all firewall is shut down). I don't remember what fluke allowed me eventually to get past this problem last time, so I'm giving up and throwing it in the trash."
1,An Unsatistified Customer and have been trying to return for my credit and have emailed 4 times with NO reply...,"The product is not what it looks like on the advertisement and I thought that it was the complete set and not few pieces, they are soooooooo light weighted and I would like to return and my refund as I have been requesting. PLEASE and Thanks"
2,Surprising - Don't Judge this One By It's Cover,"I was expecting a bad horror movie but that's not what this movie is at all. It's ultimately a sweet and hopeful movie about people trying to survive in a world that has been ravaged by war and disease. There are a few plot points that didn't make a lot of sense to me but overall the acting and scenery were spot on. The sets were realistic and the scenery was at moments serenely beautiful and at others desolate and lifeless. I also have to comment on the soundtrack. The music was wonderful. If a CD was available, I would definitely buy it. So, don't let the really bad cover scare you away from a real treat of a movie."
2,Long fan downrod fits perfectly.,"We have a sloped (cathedral) ceiling which is 13 feet high at he high end of the ceiling. we needed the rod so the 54"" fan blades would clear the slope of the ceiling and bring the fan to an appropriate height above the floor.There was no difficulty installing it."
1,Pretty much a piece of junk.,"I used this a couple of times before opening my oven to see dinner ALL OVER THE PLACE and 2 almost perfectly broken halves of Sango Nova Black 2 1/2-Quart Covered Casserole. The broken dish wasn't too hard to clean up, but everything else was an atrocity."
1,You should read the book first in the library before you buy,"If you have no experience with UNIX, maybe you will find something interesting in this book. The intention is right, ""this is NT way... and this is Solaris way"", but, the entire organization is awful, one example: you are reading and then find something like ""go to page 123..."" and you are in page 123! You better review it before you buy."
2,Without a doubt the most useful Perl book in my library,"Tom and Nat's Perl Cookbook is without a doubt the most useful Perl book in my library. It provides examples and explainations on a wide range of topics from simple tasks such as template interpolation to database connectivity and user interfaces.PCB does a wonderful job of introducing a number of concepts in applications that are useful in day to day programming while keeping the learning curve well under control. It is useful to all Perl programmers, beginning and advanced.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge of the Perl programming language without dedicating themselves to a topic for days on end."
1,Great movie - BUT,"The picture and sound are great for this movie. The problems are with using aditional feature like pause, stop, start, etc. Maybe it is just my DVD player although I have never had trouble with any other DVD or Blu-ray. I had several interuptions when trying to watch the movie and every time I paused or stopped the movie I had to start over from the beginning. Pushing resume or play started at the beginning. I love the movie and liked the quality, but am marking it down because of the inability to control the playing. If you never pause and resume you are OK."
2,Upchurch Rocks,"In the Tell the truth by Upchurch I especially like Misty and La Costa... There is also the wonderfully done, Girl Talk its so hard to really pick a favorite on this masterpiece,when all of them are so good, not forgetting of course Jack of Speed and Home Again this is a wonderful CD and I think Grammy is written all over it. Its about time!"
1,One star for special effects...,"Great specials effects, decent direction, OK acting but (and this is important I think) no plot."
2,"If you like Cussler, you'll like Matt Reilly!!","Although I'm not a fan of Matthew Reilly's novels, (I've only read one). I am a fan of Matthew Reilly. Calling temple a return to the pulp novels of old is an accurate statement and a compliment. Matthew puts his hero into one death defying situation after another only to have him extricate himself - yet again.It's been a while since I read this one, but it involves some idol carved from a meteorite in a Mayan temple and a team of US scientists sent to retreive it before (get this) an old Nazi and his team get it.Hungry Panthers, jet skis and jet packs (yes), the thrills never stop."
1,Very dissapointing.,"I expected this soundtrack to have to kick-butt techno music, but it just stinks. There is nothing on this CD that you can get into, it just sounds like some kid with his first mixer."
2,Meniketti Vocals & Guitar playing still the best!,"Y&T; has been a favorite of mine for years.I saw them open for Twisted Sister in NewOrleans 83/84 then on the farewell tour4 times then just flew to LA for 3 showsand it was worth every penny! This guyis the most underrated vocalist/guitaristin hard rock & this shows he's still gotit! Messing with Mr. Big & I Remember& Tough Luck Ave & All in this togethercould be Y&T; songs. Love the keyboardsin Together! Also No Lies, Hendrixstyle song Storm is brilliant. TheOther Side is great slow bluesy side.This is an incredible album & the moreI listen I can't understand how sucha great guitarist/singer is ignored.This should've gotten tons of airplay.I can't wait for new Y&T; album! ThankGod Y&T; and other real rock band likeUFO, KISS, Motorhead still releasenew material! Rock isn't dead butit's dying so Keep rocking Dave!"
2,another Boondock Saints DVD to the collection,"Keep them coming :)I bought the first boondock saints DVD that came out.Then I bought a different release with some extras to it.Both DVDs were cut on the violence. I sold the first DVD (a shame really)I bought a version in Europe that was uncut, but non-anamorphic.and now this one will be on my wish list. This movie has a lot of style. Great acting and great cinematography (as far as action movie cinematography goes ofcousre)I really want to know what's on the second disc :)"
2,EXCELLENT MOVIE!,"Excellent movie. NOthing is perfect but as a fantasy is a wonderful story, very inspiring! The story may seem silly for harsh critics, but hey, so are other stories. This movie is full of positive energy. Recommended for all ages."
1,Save your money...,"This book was a complete waste of $20. The EOS 7 has so many features, but very few of them are explained in this book any better than the manual. These folks should be embarassed to sell this for the price. I now know why they're sealed in plastic wrap at the bookstore -- to prevent you from actually seeing inside before purchasing... For other cameras I own, I've found the Short Course in Photography series by Dennis Curtin to be great resources. I don't think they have one on the EOS 7 however."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I loved The Baker's Boy series. I bought this one, hoping that it would be the same. Instead, I found myself giving up half-way through. I might pick this up again and finish it, but I stopped caring about the characters. And the previous lip-chewing comment was right. It became a real distraction to me. Too bad, I really wanted to like this."
2,Eye opening.,"I have owned this book for several years now, and still flip through it from time to time. More then anything else, this is a collection of Bruce's random thoughts and observations compiled into one book. A majority of the thoughts are Zen/Taoist/Buddhist in nature, and when I first read them they really opened up my eyes and broke me out of my boring existence I once lived in. People that don't appreciate the martial arts and/or Buddhist philosophy might find some of his thoughts a little out there and useless to them. All in all, for the price, you can't beat this book."
1,Don't believe the hype!,"What a disappointment! I recently purchased this much-vaunted anniversary album and I'm sorry to say it will go into my archive after one play, never to see the light of day again. Talk about a dead performance - from everyone concerned. There is no life in the orchestra : sure, they are note-perfect, but you can practically hear them counting their beats. Not what is needed for one of Braodway's greatest shows. Hayley Westenra as Maria has a nice voice and is well able for the range, but without any show experience delivers a bland, uninteresting performance. Vittorio Grigolo as Tony should not have crossed over from opera. His accent would be more suited to one of the Sharks! Melanie Marshall as Anita is the recording's only saving grace - but not enough to save the show!!Caveat emptor..........."
2,Worth waiting for,"This album was well worth the wait. I've been hooked on Numan since first hearing Pure. I hadn't been familiar with his work before that and, although I appreciate his early artistry, am a fan of his recent work from Exile forward. This album was NO disappointment. If you've fallen for the dark, brooding melodies and lyrics, the layers of wave over wave of genius it takes to produce such perfectionistic sound, the way his music can carry you emotionaly to another place that isn't always comfortable and yet croons in absolute suduction...then you CANNOT pass this album over."
2,Wonderful Movie for the entire family,My entire family enjoyed this movie. SO nice to sit and watch a movie with my children and not hear foul language or see any suggestive material.
2,Rev. J's Review,The first bible I received had the chapters out of order. I called the company and the experience was great. They displays a positive response to a negative situation.My bible was replaced and the person on the phone displayed a pleasant and cheerful disposition.
1,Cat's Paw,"A cute story if meant for maybe 5th-8th grade readers. As an adult, I found it boring (kept falling asleep) just because Miranda was doing the same thing over and over and over, but I did enjoy the cat (figured out who she was maybe a chapter after she appeared) and the ending was heartwarming!"
1,Two Movies one Dud,"Well I took a chance on this double disc set featuring 1973's Don't Look in the Basement and 1979's Don't Open the Door both directed by S.F. Brownrigg.I had seen Don't look in the Basement several times before and consider it a decent if unexceptional thriller.I'd never seen Don't Open the Door before so I figured why not take a chance since I liked Basement ? Well Don't Open the Door is just a lousy movie so that makes the whole package lose 1 star right there.Terrible story,lousy acting,annoying as all hell killer/phone stalker,slow as molasses pacing,no thrills or suspense just 90 or so minutes of tedious crap.At least Basement was well thought out if also a tad slow and the acting was better even the low budget fx are better than in Door.I'd recommend trying to buy Don't look in the Basement as a solo disc and avoid Don't Open the Door unless you are a sucker for punishment."
2,Holes Louis Sachar,"I would recommened this book to a friend, because it is easy to understand and it is a very good book for teens to rea. It's about a boy named Stanley Yelnats and he is under a curse that began all because his great great grandfather. He gets sent to Camp Green Lake because he was accused of stealin sweet feet shoe's from a shelter home. He notices that at camp their not digging holes to build character but to also help the warden look for somthing and he tries to dig up the truth in this humorous tale.huda@dhs"
1,Prices is too High,The price is a little high...... this product is just a plastic tank !! and they sell it as a Best quality product and it's OK that's all
1,THINK ABOUT IT!,hey I know a person named jackson that got kicked out of the band for really no reason.Slick shoes are supposed to be a christian band but they are not! they stink if you ask me.Why spend all your money on this junk?
1,Constant problems.,"My wife and I both bought Polar FT60 heart rate monitors in 2009. We like the FT60 watch unit, but the Wearlink transmitters have caused us so many problems that we went back to using the T31 transmitters from our old Polar heart rate monitors. I've replaced the batteries several times and even after that I have constant problems receiving the heart rate. The T31 transmitters are much more reliable and we finally threw away our Wearlinks. If you need a replacement transmitter, I highly recommend buying the older style T31 tranmitter."
2,ok,Its a great show. Better to watch it without commercials.Item arrived just as described. No complaints!What else can I say?
2,Yes there can be an Adam & Steve,"Having first seen this movie at the 2005 film festival in Tampa, due to the large audience, and the laughter from the movie, we missed a lot of the good lines because they came so close together. We couldn't wait for the DVD to come out! When we recived it we watched it the day it came and we laughed so hard our sides hurt. Yes there were a lot of ""type casting"" but if you think about it most people can think of people they know who fit each and every one of them. I think it is one of the best ""Gay Movies"" I have seen it a long, long time."
2,The Brandenbergs from the other side...,"Jordi Savall is one of a very small group of exceptional viola da gamba players and conductors. What makes this rendition of the Brandenburgs as pleasing as it is is the clarity of the inner voices. I attribute this to Savall's Medieval and Renaissance roots. Most of the existing recordings of these gorgeous pieces are conducted by persons whose experience and expertise is Baroque or later. Savall's sensitivity to what came before and led up to J.S. Bach is, IMHO, the reason that these recordings are as splendid as they are. I am an avid follower of Savall and recommend his recordings almost without exception. This one is at the top of my list of Brandenburgs."
2,"Past their prime, but still good stuff.","It's from the post-John Williams days, with Kevin Peek, Herbie Flowers, Steve Gray, Tristan Fry, and Paul Hart (Violin, Keys, Mandolin), so is past the group's peak, and is the 51 minute edit, rather than the full show, sadly, but it's good stuff nevertheless. It just could've been better.[...](I await the Westminster Abbey show!)"
2,a perfect pairing,"Two of my favorite artists teamed perfectly together.I think all the other fabulous reviews say it perfectly. I can add that both of these artists have been supplying us with joy and pleasure for many many years, and I am so grateful. They are both one of a kind... we will never again see their amazing ability to express music the unique way in which they both have. Fabulous CD."
2,"Meh, these are ok","The handle is beautiful, the telescoping feature is awesome, nice brass colored ring for storage. The fork metal is a little flimsy though. It reminds me of an old radio antenna. It will be fine for marshmellows and probably hotdogs, but I was hoping for something a litle heavier... the handles seem too nice for the forks! I am keeping them because they telescope and are easy to store, but I am still on the lookout."
2,Wealth of Ebook Info,I still have to re-read this book and absorb all the great information. It is a keeper...one to go back to again and again.
2,accessible wisdom,"What I love about this book is that weeks later I can still remember Baldwin's seven whispers and have been able to incorporate them into my busy life. I know I should be doing a better job at whisper #2, ""Move at the pace of guidance,"" but even at the pace I'm moving I find these lovely sayings and the essays that accompany them reside in my mind. Many times a day they float to the surface of my mind and help me stay connected to spirit all week long. This book lives on my bedside table and I read little paragraphs over and over. It's a great gift. I've bought half a dozen copies for people of different religious persuasions and they all like it as much as I do."
1,Worthless from the get go...,"What a HUGE disappointment! It looked like it would be great. There were 2 of them. I saw them demonstrated on QVC - seemed to work great. But alas, neither worked even one time. I kept thinking - hmm - looks so simple - what am I doing wrong - does it only work on certain bottles - etc. I wouldn't waste my money on this design - there are plenty of other wine bottle sealers out there that work first time and all the time."
2,My Afternoons with Margueritte,"Utterly gorgeous movie. Sensitive, sweet, incredible acting and what an honor to watch a 95-year-old actress and a bumbling klutz teach us what kindness is."
2,Good book you should read it,"it could be life changing, i'm glad i was introduced to this book i'm a better person for it! However, this particular book is not the updated version even though it was advertised as such so be careful. The updated one is much better. Purchase the one with the purple cover."
2,"Warm, cozy, terriffic","I love my bearpaw boots. They are everything they said they would be. A word of caution though, make sure you go up a size. They are not true to their size."
2,A Dream Come True,"We have acquired this system piecemeal. I would also recommend the 24 volt weedeater unless you have a postage stamp yard. I applaud Black and Decker for figuring this one out. First, they are light and easy to handle. With all of the batteries (I have 4) there is always enough juice. Second, as a woman I needed something I could handle. My husband is thrilled as he finds the driveway blown off, the hedges trimmed and I've yet to sink my teeth into the weedeater but we trimmed all the area around our small orchard of 10 trees on one battery. To me these are like self- stick stamps--why didn't someone think of these years ago?????? Happy yarding!!!!!"
2,"Come on, and get it, NOW !","This cd is great ! Buy it, you won't regret... These absolutely beautiful girls play an extraordinary metal-fusion... Whaou ! Really great !"
2,musical child psychology,"Fred Rogers' songs rang in my head while I was raising my children, and I knew they provided excellent parenting advice: ""I like to be told when you're going away"" ""Sometimes people are good ... but the very same people who are good sometimes are the very same people who are bad sometimes,"" and ""When the baby comes to your house . . . you'll always be the oldest one."" What surprised me was the musical fabulousness of his arrangements -- not humdrum, but intriguing harmonies, sparely scored, with just enough notes. As a former piano teacher, I can say that these arrangements are suitable for those with one year of piano and more fun to play than most beginner piano scores. Get them for the words, get them for the music -- you'll be glad."
2,Funny,I think House Of Payne 4 was the best of all. Great Stories and more humour and has not lost its message.Great ending to the series.
1,"Very thin plot, full of holes.","Very weak, unbelievable plot. However since we had started watching it we had to finish it! Avoid if at all possible"
1,Hip Hop Pets are the Pits,"The MP3 players stink. They make moderately good interactive toys that move and blink heir lights. They do move a bit more than the i-dog or i-cat because they move their paws, when you move your hand around in front of them, not to the beat of the music. However, as speakers to listen to your music they are aweful. The speaker is scratchy sounding, full of treble, and doesn't even pick up the softer and higher sounds of voices or whispered lyrics. Some songs I can't even tell which songs they are. Don't waste your money!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I love prog- its my fav genre- but i bought this CD- and now its a coaster for my cats fnacy feast! The long ""epic"" songs just dont work- i mean cmon- 30 mins? no way."
1,DO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT,"This is a bad product. It is not compatible with my multiple devices like DELL laptop etc. that make it virtually useless.Its support phone line is a garbage, horrible support from their oversee team(must be cheap) bad attitude, poor technical knowledge, far from professional way."
2,NORMAN SELLS ANOTHER ONE,"A clever and informative book about the principles of successful selling techniques. The engaging character and the diary format personalizes the information and strikes a cord with anyone who works in the real world of selling and marketing oneself. The use of humor to emphasize important points makes this book enjoyable as well as useful. I recommend ""OH Norman"" highly!"
1,Toro quality,"I purchased an 8 inch 12 volt Toro cordless trimmer in September. I used it three times and on the fourth time the motor stuck in the ""on"" position and couldn't be turned off. It went off when the battery died. I carefully took the machine apart to examine the electrical wiring but could find nothing wrong . It would not recharge, so was ""dead"". I gave it to a charity with the admonition that it would not run but perhaps they could fix. I now have no trimmer.."
1,"Shows all disposable batteries as good, even when they're dead.","When I received this item I tested it on approximately twenty-five dead batteries I had in my ""to-recycle"" bin. According to this device, every single one of the batteries--removed from various remotes, smoke alarms, etc--were completely ""good"". Avoid this item, it is useless."
2,its worth trying,"during my first pregnancy i can across this on amazon, i researched and thought to give it a shot. ideal of not feeling wet for 5 days and less pain with smaller environmental foot print got me. i ordered size two to use after my first child. i had to wait 6 month to use it (i got my period after 6 month of delivering a baby). it is defiantly tricky to insert and take off. i had to cut stem almost 2/3 because i felt discomfort after inserting the cup now it fits perfectly and i still can easily remove it.i use it during swimming lessons too, its like no feeling of having period at all.still there are days i have to give it another try to insert and because of heavy flow i have to empty 3 times a day but still its worth all. i am still using same cup after my second baby and it works great."
2,Don't confuse by the title!,"First of all, you have to forget the ""24 hours"" tale. Do you really expect to learn Visual C++ in 24 hours? No one can. To be honest, this is not a bad book, but it does require at least begin-intermediate C++ level.The first several chapters are just to help frersh your memory quickly, so you may want to skip it if you are really confident with C++. In the rest of the book, the author chooses a App-wizard approach, which can really help readers pick up Visual C++ within a relatively short period. The thing is you may also want to have another book for reference, like ""Programming windows with MFC"" by Jeff Prosise."
1,Sandmand is silly and pretensious,The author dwells in a world of silly feelings that a healthy individual will not be able to relate to. This whole series is nothing but immaturity disguised as intellectual deep stuff. Stay away from it.
2,"For all Wagnarians and the people just getting to know Wagner, THIS DVD is a MUST. Most informative .",A recording of such a scale is revealed in this DVD. Only down side is that the Decca people didn't record the first session but what you'll experiance in the last is worth every penny!
2,An excellent and readable book for background studies of NT,"For study of the background of the New Testament, this is a great place to begin. It is readable and interesting. The material is well-organized as well. I highly recommend it."
2,Love it!,Huge hit - mindless fun video to watch. Gave it as a gift and had lots of laughs with family and friends.
2,Great Thermostate and a Great Price!,Our LUX thermostat was getting stuck in the ON position in the summer so it was time to replace it. Looked around at all of the different brands out there with all of the bells and whistles that you will never use and decided to buy this one. Very easy to install (detailed instructions on how to install it) and was very easy to program and it looks great. No issues with the design like other users have had but come on it's a thermostat how often do you mess with it once you have it programed? I highly recommend this item.
1,I must be missing something,"Okay, I have the distinct feeling that I was supposed to read something before I saw this anime because there seems to be so much more then I saw going on. The plot seems to be somewhat serious until the characters break out in weird laughter or gags out of nowhere, kind of like in tenchi, but unlike tenchi there really isn't anything funny about it. Also, for an hour of anime, I was definently left with the feeling that there was so much left, maybe because none of the characters reached their stated goals and yada yada. I'd suggest Gestalt be watched once future volumes are released... but I've yet to find out if there is anything else to it. So... if you're really dying to see a different anime and you want something that's going to leave you wondering and confused... go for it! But otherwise, save your money."
2,"An excellent, balanced look at the events","If you could read only one book about the OK Corral gunfight, this should be it. There is no attempt to make either group right or wrong; too often these days, one or the other group is portrayed as a set of complete bad guys, when ""complete"" is much too strong a word. There are a few other books that should be considered, Chaput's ""Virgil Earp: Western Peace Officer"", Tanner and DeArment's ""Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait"", and Bob Boze Bell's books on Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. All reach pretty much the same conclusions although there are some variations in viewpoint that will make the reader think (for example, Tanner's view on just who was the target at the Boarding House is intriguing). Anyway, Dr. Marks' book is well-written, with a style that is easy to follow and appreciate. It is my hope that she finds other western subjects to write about so that we may enjoy more of the fruits of her research and writing ability."
1,VHS not in working order,VHS does not play properly the tracking is off. Video will not come into focus.
1,Anti Climatic,"Was expecting a unique unit which would allow me to uniquely integrate my IPod and PC. What I got instead was a nice looking monitor with ok graphics, tinney sounding speakers and menu buttons which discourage you from making any adjustments to the settings due to their feel and non ease-of-use. The number of USB ports and card readers on the base are the shining points of this monitor. I paid the bucks but didn't get any bang!!!"
2,nice trainer. instructions don't cover it all though,"i just got this trainer and have put about 50 miles on it so far. very nice. great feel. the instructions makes this a 4 star rating. it does a good job explaining/showing how to put it together. what then threw me for a loop was what i was to do with the included skewer and the cup with the skewer adapter. there is zero explanation of what to do, why i should change the skewer, how to change the cup, etc. thankfully, all the explanation i needed for what, why, how was on youtube."
2,feathers in the fire put,"A wonderful tale of love. Catherine Cookson brings the era to life.Her knack for bringing the language of that era, takes the reader into the heart of the story."
1,The Author is Double-Jointed,"He has to be since he spends so much time patting himself on the back. This is a bad book, pure and simple. The author spends an inordinate amount of time talking about his history of losing money and making money. But the stories aren't in great detail and come off as braggadocio. In addition, his advice is minimal and simple. He goes through the time value of money and how yields on small amounts of money invested for many years will allow you to retire well off but doesn't really give creditable advice on retiring really rich, other than buying his newsletter.I cannot emphasize enough how bad this book is. Only two other times have I not read a book I started in its entirety. Here's number three. I read the first half and scanned the last half. I assure there was no improvement. Take a pass on this turkey."
2,This Cd is almost as good as the wiggles.,this is wiggle time. Emu side for life. Emu side 'till i di
2,prose from a great literary figure,"A good selection of prose from T. S. Eliot. After years of reading, I still find his prose more effective and more useful than his poetry. (I know -- sheer heresy.) Eliot places great emphasis on The Tradition and on an impersonal approach to art, an emphasis which aspiring writers of today would be wise to heed. Like Matthew Arnold, Eliot's criticism is dogmatic, and right. The reader's only wish is that this collection included more."
1,Weak,"Ok, so I didn't read and obey the reviews for this product but I thought I had enough experience with Norton products to make it work. It doesn't. Save your money. While I didn't have the problems with installation that others have had, I find that the software does very little to aid in helping my computer to run better.Of special note is clean sweep. When you run it MANY programs say that they are protected and cannot be deleted. What is up with that? I paid my money for this product, now get the stuff out of my computer that I tell you to. It really doesn't work. A specific example is Netscape. Netscape has infested my computer and I have tried to delete it through add and remove programs but my Sony (AKA shotty) won't let me delete it. So I thought Norton would go in an tear it out. No way. Norton doesn't do anything you cannot do yourself. Do yourself a favor, skip the Norton and buy premium beer instead!"
2,Impress,"I just set up the unit middle of living ,my wife is cooking and of course the cooking odor spreads through out the living room. I'll say about 15 minutes or so, I notice the cooking smell is diminishing. It also takes out the air refresher smell, too. I brought this unit because of allergy problem and so far I feel better. I notice that the price went up, too."
1,Annoying product. Dont bother.,Light and slight. The whole thing is touch screen and uses a pen to touch the screen. Lose the pen and your screwed. Also the light only stays on for a second and if the angle isnt right on the screen you cant see anything.Don't bother!
1,Not Happy,"I bought these for my wife's car thinking I could improve over the original headlamps, well that didn't happen and within one week I'm replacing these with another set (Sylvania's). The first set came in and one of the bulbs didn't work, I called customer service and they sent a replacement, they both worked this time but the wife wasn't happy, she couldn't see any better and maybe worse cause of the way the light beam was!?! The packaging had no details like what you see on the web page, it was just a clear box with bulbs not even sealed. I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,An Amazing Achievement !!,"Well, Rachel Portman has done it again! And this tops her outstanding list of scores! Her simple yet, beautiful score for ""The Cider House Rules"" is a stirring, and touching work of art! Her recurring theme will bring tears to the eyes of those who were enchanted with the film, as I was! As soon as I saw the movie, I had to have the cd! I went directly from the theatre, to the record store to buy it! And I listened to my favorite track, the first one in my car on the way back to the theatre to see the movie again! This is a must have for any classical music lover! Portman does amazingly well with a piano, and a string quartet to bring the movie to life in our minds! Get it today, you will NOT regret it!"
1,jez,This is garbage. I know you get what you pay for but Grizzly has not let me down in the past. It came unbalanced. What a disappointment.
1,is there a clean copy of this film around??????,The film itself has always been kind of silly but ive always liked it ..but the video and audio quality on this DVD are truly terrible and i had hoped after the terrible quality of the VHS that the DVD would be better but ohhhh well if you have the VHS don't bother to buy the DVD...
1,Not Happy with Product,This item stopped working after 3 months. Had to buy another quickly as I use my laptop for writing book and business.
2,The hinge on which all else turns,"this is the doctrine which, said luther, all else turns. This was luther's finest diatribe (he said he thought more clearly in a state of anger). luther fought tooth and nail with rome's representative, disiderus erasmus. These two historical giants go toe to toe and Scripture to Scripture, as luther maintained that free will ""was a fiction without a name."" The bondage of the will is the cornerstone of reformation theology and should be read by all christians who wonder why luther and calvin fought so hard for it."
2,Best TurboTax Price,"Amazon had the best price for TurboTax that I could find anywhere, including the Intuit web site."
1,Biggest Hits?,"These were mostly not the songs I remember as his biggest hits. A couple of them were familiar, but overall I was disappointed."
1,Molechaser didn't chase,"The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it. So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it). To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like."
1,The Mad Minute: A Race to Master the Number Facts,What happens if the kids start from the last question and works backwards? Anyone knows how to get in touch with the authors?
1,Stupid,"This is a sickingly incipid ""book,"" a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print."
1,These do not work on candy melts (for Cake Pops),"I should have read the reviews on here before purchasing but I assumed it would work on another Wilton product (the candy melts). It does not and now my ""spooky"" eyeball cake pops will just have to be regular eyes. I can't believe I wasted almost ten bucks on these markers."
2,great show!,It's wonderful that this series is on DVD! What a great show. The Outlaw Years was one of my all time favorite Westerns. Having every episode on DVD is fantastic.
2,Bought this for my husband's keyboard...,"...as one of his birthday gifts and I am so glad I did! He loves to play the piano, but we only have space for a keyboard, and the quality just doesn't compare to a real, full-sized piano so I started looking into pedals. This provides a richness to his playing, and the quality is top notch!"
2,"Excellent value, but not perfectly designed","This is an excellent pie pan considering how inexpensive it is (currenly $3.20) but I would prefer the handles be larger. The handles are tiny, and can be difficult to hold securely.I did have one explode on me; I took a pie out of the oven and placed it on the stove, and not much later the whole pan broke shooting fragments of glass against my body and around the kitchen. I didn't get cut, so it was just surprising and inconvenient.I continue to use these since they're so cheap... I just make sure to put them on cooling racks."
2,Terrific performance of songs that both surprise and delight,"Kathleen Wilhoite not only sings and plays several instruments beautifully on her first CD, she wrote the words and music as well. I was first interested in this disk because of her acting career (ER, Mad About You, L.A. Law, The Edge, Angel Heart, The Color of Night, Lorenzo's Oil) but it became obvious to me that here was a complete surprise. Instead of the usual Hollywood ""I am an actress, hear me sing"" effort, her songs are wonderful, thoughtful works that start in one direction and by the end take the listener to a completely different and unexpected place. One wonders what life experiences she has drawn on to fuel these wry, insightful glimpses into her (and our) very soul(s). I look forward to her next effort and highly recommend this one."
2,Shatters all Illusions!,"This will be the most important book you will ever read. If you want to know the real TRUTH of the 'meaning' of Life and what actually happens when you die, read this book. Not for beginners, dabblers or dilettantes.I also recommend Guenon's ""The Reign of Quantity"" as crucial in unveiling our current miasma of amnesia of this Cycle of Time."
2,So far so good,"These adapters seem sturdy enough. If you need an RCA-to-1/4"" mono adapter, these should be fine, and the price is certainly reasonable.I had some that I bought at Radio Shack a few years ago for three times the price, and the cement that holds the tips inside the shaft would fail. When I removed the adapter from the jack it was plugged into, the tip would remain in the jack. It was very difficult to remove it. So far this has not happened with these.I have some similar adapters that are at least twenty years old, and I've never had a problem with them. These are not quite as substantial as the old ones. I hope these will do as well."
2,Easy to follow. Humurous and easy reading.,"I have had the opportunity to read several programming books in the past year as a student. The text books used in school are hard to read and even harder to follow. Learning a language from the text books offered without the aid af an instructor would be impossible. This book, on the other hand, makes it possible for anyone to learn and master the procedures required to use TCL in an industrial environment."
2,Hot Water Fast,"This solar shower heated a full bag of water from the tap to maximum temperature in about 2 1/2 hours. The linear thermometer showed over 120 degrees. There were no clouds in the sky and the ambient temperature was about 80-85 degrees. During the shower, if you crack the filler cap a little, the flow of water out the shower end was increased. This temperature was uncomfortably warm, so we actually added some cold water to the bag. Good value!"
1,this incribed piece of leather is a writing excercise.,"The so called 4QTherapeia has nothing to do with medicine. ""This is simply a writing excercise by a fairly skilled person, perhaps a scribe, who used a small left-over piece of leather in order to write some meaningless words and letters and thus to accustom his hand to the pen and ink and to the writing material before beginning to write in earnest. This is a common practice, both in antiquity and among modern graphic artists."" For details see J. Naveh, ""A Medical Document or a Writing Excercise? The So-called 4QTherapeia,"" Israel Exploration Journal 36 (1986), pp.52-55."
1,Constantly resetting this router,"There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. I can be in the middle of surfing, playing games over the net or even mid-download, the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection. The LAN will still be operational, but the internet will suddenly be inacccessible. The support page only offers ""reset everything..."" which is ludicrous. A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually. I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day.I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now. This Netgear is the most finicky/exasperating router I have ever encountered. I will never buy from Netgear again, and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter."
2,Thought-provoking and Rich!,"Being that Rebecca Jones is my mother perhaps I am partially biased in my review. Truly though, all favoritism aside, I found this book to be the wisest and most knowledgeable book on womanhood from a Biblical perspective that I have ever read. Too many women's books are cut and dried, cliche and reductionistic but this book truly delves into the role of women in the Bible, their role in society, within the church and the home. It is thought-provoking and rich and redefines womanhood according to Biblical principles."
1,weights change every second!,"I just called amazon to exchange my scale. Hope I didn't make a mistake. When I first got it, i loved it but then 2 weeks later i got different numbers each time i weighed myself. First I was 104. A second later I weighed myself and it showed 118. Then it would change each time I weighed myself to another absurd number. Is it too hard to ask for what I weigh? It's the reason I bought the scale. Hopefully this exchange from amazon will be a non-defected one that can give me an accurate weight reading!!!!"
2,Review,Good review book! It helped me refresh my memory after such a long time! This book is really good for the first time in Accounting field.
2,Kombu!,"Great Kombu! Provides a fantastic ""sea"" like flavor. Be sure to soak properly and do not let it boil excessively!! Plenty of Kombu to make tons of Dashi and other stock. Will buy again!"
1,This Guy's in Love With You,After listening to this cd a few times the audio has gone bad and I am unable to play it any longer. Unfortunately I have had it over thirty days so I am unable to return it to Amazon. I am reluctant to purchase any more cd's in the future.
2,I'v read this book 5 times and enjoyed it each time!!!,"I was 14 when I first read this book. Two friends (Welly and Hether) are the outcasts of there school. Welly wants to be a fighter but is too blind and fat. Hether, a girl thrown out of the house by her mother's new husband, wants a real adventure like the ones in story books. These wishes seam impossabole, untill they meet Earl Bedwas a boy with no past. together they must over-come tremounds trials of stranth and courage. this book is full of fast pased Adventure, and good laughs. I recomend this book for all ages. This book has inspierd me to write storys more than any other book. I love it !!!"
2,Down Syndrome,"Excellent album. It's insane, intense and instantly likeable. Yes, it has some intentional funny moments and some politics but so did Frank Zappa. If Zappa had done some heavy rock-this would be it. Though it's extreme it's also catchy. Recommended higly."
2,Wonderful read,"This is an excellent book. It tells a terrific story that will capture and hold your attention. At the same time, amazingly, you'll learn some really interesting history and architecture while Follett's rich rendering of the time and customs will allow you to ""experience"" the book, if you know what I mean. You'll feel a part of it, rather than a witness. Enjoy."
2,A 13 year olds review,"this album is WONDERFUL!!. How do ppl expect these albums to come out has,perfect. So what ... if it isnt better than the fragile, or the downward spiral... it is still NIN, and its diffrent, yet freshand thats why i like it. I have been a nin fan since i was 10, some ppl i think i am too young to listen to nine inch nails, but i think screw them, because it's an expresion of music i think is great, and interesting to listen to. great cd... dont know what ppl are complaining about, i dont really favor the beggining beat to some songs, but overall those songs are good( only, to be more specific) i congratulate nin, and i think u should do the same thing, cause of great thought put into this cd."
2,Pleased with People,The magazine shipped faster than the estimated date...It was the best price for a 6 month subscription...Overall pleased with my purchase
2,This is a wonderful book !.`,"I am 57 years old, a white, suburban male, with almost no experience in jazz. I know what I like, but I don't know why, and although I enjoy older generations of singers and songs, many of the people in this book are unfamiliar beyond their names. That is the triumph of this book. It is so well written, so beautiful and rapsodic,so educational and entertaining, I want to learn more, hear more, and find the connections. The only thing I wish were included were photographs and a 10 cd set to hear the music the author refers to. Now, I have to get a saxophone or trumpet !"
2,Awesome Debut,"After buying `I Am A Bird Now' and being completely captivated I quickly went out and bought the self titled debut CD by Antony and the Johnsons and if you enjoyed their second album it is a pretty safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It is mostly in the same style and still has Antony's wonderful and unique vocals. I love `Atrocities' and the piano playing throughout this track is both melancholy and beautiful. I also adore the chorus on `Divine' which raises a smile every time I play it. This took me a few more listens than IAABN to fully get into it and I found the strings a little more obtrusive on some tracks, but once you do you will be just as enraptured and impressed. The artwork is original and unusual but that sums up Antony and the Johnsons perfectly, original and unusual, but always great. Well worth checking out at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,historical novel with memorable female character,"Like most of Lee Smith's novels, this is excellent. It reminded me of ""Jane Eyre"", the classic British novel about an orphan girl who faces tremendous challenges in her life. It may also remind you of ""Gone with the Wind"", with the post-Civil War setting (except that the Ku Klux Klan in this story have no redeeming qualities at all- which is more accurate), and the amount of suffering experienced by the heroine. The first part of the story, Molly Petree's childhood, is really the best- it is haunting. The rest of it is nearly as good. At one point Molly writes ""I gave it my whole heart. I would do it again."" That also describes how I feel about this book. Smith clearly did a great job with her research to make this story feel so real."
1,If you have nothing in your collection to date...,"I think this has been stated in other reviews, if you already have Enigma you don't need this album. Otherwise it's decent. I would suggest Babble's ""The Stone"" (out of print); b-tribe's ""sensual sensual"" and Olive's ""virgin"" as other mood music choices. I have yet to find that perfect album that is very sexy but not cheezy - might just have to live with iPod playlists folks..."
1,"DON'T READ THIS BOOK, WHATEVER YOU HEAR!!","I hated it. This book was completely lacking action. It just sucked!If you want historical fiction, read Jimmy Spoon and the Pony Express by Kristaina Gregory or Alice Rose and Sam. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH IT!"
2,One of his best!,"As a longtime fan of Johnny Lee (I have, over the last 20 years, collected many of his CDs, as well as albums and tapes), I LOVE this CD, it is my favourite! It never disappoints, day after day!"
1,Wheel of fortune,We found this version of WoF didn't have the correct drivers as part of its installation and needed some Micromedai Flashman 3 drivers. In our particular case we had to organise another graphics card to cope with what was required. Not very IT friendly.
1,Once again ripped off,"I only rate this a 2 because I found the movie to be thought provoking. It's the product itself that I find lacking. The disclaimer at the top states you cannot redeem your Digital Copy past December 4th 2012. That is the date of the release. What a rip off! It may be offered for half off but unless you get it (at a much higher cost) that same day you will be out half of what you paid for! Lame!And what is this shift to only put extras on Blue-Ray? I'm sorry that I can't afford the fancy HD, but that doesn't mean I don't want to see the extras as well. Once again I'll just get in line to rent it from the library. Or off Red Box. Or order it via my cable provider. Much cheaper!"
1,I've Been Conned,"The misleading title of this DVD borders on outright fraud. The majority of this whopping 38-minute film is a re-enactment of Hearst's childhood told in a style appropriate for kindergartners. After 20 minutes, we adults awaken from our slumber to see actors playing Hearst and Julia Morgan pantomiming discussion about the castle while the insipid voice-over drones on. The final few minutes of this turkey re-enact a weekend at San Simeon in the most irritating way possible. Cameras sweep briskly through a few rooms of the monumental castle without pause or significant comment, as if this brief part of the movie were just a trivial afterthought.A disaster, an embarrassment, and a major disappointment. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,Great for conserving water,"I was looking for a way to stop the flow and conserve hot water while showering. I live in a small house with a small hot water tank. Was tired of running out of hot water about 5 minutes into a shower. This is a great solution. Allows you to get wet, stop the water, soap up and then rinse off. No running out of hot water and no need to turn off the water at the taps and re-adjust the temperature when you turn the taps back on. My one minor complaint is that the water flow isn't entirely stopped; there is still a small trickle that flows when the valve is in the ""off"" position. i highly recommend if you're looking to cut your water bill or avoid cold showers."
2,Gernsheim work is a winner,"Of course the Brahms is a masterpiece and there are many recordings to choose from. But the Gernsheim 2nd string quartet in A minor is a very fine work indeed. Gernsheim was a friend of Brahms and his style certainly reflects his knowing the great master. I play violin and viola and upon hearing this recording I set out to find the music for the Gernsheim quartet - and was successful. I have played it twice (1st viollin once, viola the other time) with 2 different groups, both like it - the second group being professional musicians in the Orquesta Sinfonica de Yucatan. They, in particular, were very much won over by this dramatic work and are eager to play it again. The Manderling quartet play wonderfully on this recording, both the Gernsheim as well as the Brahms. Five stars!"
1,What a lie! Solar Moler did NOT work.,"Well, I bought 3 of these solar molers, thinking that they would work based on people's reviews here. I followed the instructions, recharged them as directed, but I still have tunnels in my yard!***THEY DON'T WORK!!***If any of u r consider buying it, don't bother! It's been almost 3 months & I have tunnels RIGHT NEXT to Solar Molers! Disappointing & I'm returning mine! I'll lose the $9.99 shipping fee, sucks!"
2,Out of Print!!!???,"I can't believe this book is out of print in paperback and out of stock in hardcover. What a shame! ""Catering to Nobody"" is the first lovable book in the culinary mystery series. Among the twists and turns of an engrossing mystery you will find about 3 recipes (other books have more). In this book, Goldy's business is officially shut down due to poison-laced coffee that nearly kills her ex-father-in-law. Many believe she is guilty ... so Goldy must find the real culprit!"
1,Not for learning,"I have a nifty XML editor that renders XSLT and I found it impossible to make sense of the author's presentation. It is too cutesy (in the O'Reilly style). Instead of progressing in a straightforward manner, the author throws everything at you at once, including many obscure functions you'll probably never use. The appendix material may be useful (XSLT and XPath and functions), but only if you learn in some other way. I don't want to see SVG and VRML in chapter 2 with the ""Hello, World"" example."
2,Great MP3/CD player,"I was leary of purchasing this device(since I couldn't find ANY competitive players in stores), but its GREAT! Once I realized that I couldn't use DirectCD to create the CD's I had NO problems. The only negative I could find is the small ard to read LCD with no ID3 capability.Butr if you want a great CD player that can play HOURS of MP3's this is the one!"
2,An outstanding product,I shopped all over for a quality hose reel that I wouldn't have to replace in a few years. The Rapid Reel is a quality design and quality execution. I found nothing else to come close to it. USA made wins again!
1,Misses a lot of hair,"After using this epilator for a couple months, I decided epilating wasn't for me. Some people can take the pain, and some can't--I can't. The real reason I've given this epilator 2 stars though is that it leaves a LOT of hair behind. Obviously, one would prefer to make as few passes over the area as possible, but this epilator could never seem to grab all the hairs. You're not supposed to go over the same area multiple times, but that was the only way to get even most of the hair.On a positive note, the cordless function is nice, as is the wet/dry option. For me, some areas were easier to epilate wet, and others dry. I can't comment on the battery life, because I was never able to endure the pain that long...."
2,Great banana hanger/ fruit holder,"Love it. Looks good and great design. The banana hanger part is removable so if it's not needed you can remove it. Great to have bananas and other fruits all in one place. Well built and strong does not tip over from weight of bananas even when there's no fruit in the bottom. Worth the price, I have seen similar products in stores not made as well and a lot more pricey."
1,Photo doesn't match item.,The hat didnt match the item. The color was completely different and not a school color.
2,Another success by this renowned Oxford academic,"Once again the world's academic community is faced with a new, exciting and challenging study, in this book edited by the world-known Oxford academic Ngaire Woods (along with lesser known colleagues), with contributions from some of the world's leading names in this field. The editors' and the author's views come across vividly in the chapters, yet subjectively and impartially. The style is fervid, the prose is amene, and the book is overall enjoyable, also readable by the average cultured person and not just the expert."
2,Great Reissues,"I love when some things are reissued that I had on vinyl when originally released. Being an extreme fan of jazz piano trios I've collected many great albums by Evans, Jamal, Peterson, Corea, Jarrett, Tyner. Mance was never in the same class as some of the innovators but this album is very refreshing and tastefully done. I think that it has a perfect mix of laid back as well as more intense pieces. Many albums have tunes that I want to hear and some I'll skip. Not so with Junior's Blues. It's one that I can put on and listen straight through and thoroughly enjoy. Mance may not have the prodigious technique like a Tatum or Peterson but he's got more than enough to express and communicate his feelings. I'd recommend it to most people and if you are a fan of jazz piano buy it now. I'm confident you'll be glad you did."
2,"Use often, great even after 4 years of use.",I've had this stock pot for 4 years and it still looks brand new and works great. Often times in the winter I make two batches of soup at the same time so I purchased a second one about a year ago. Couldn't be happier.
2,got it for my little cousin,"i know its out of stock everywhere, so a tip: i got mine for [$$] with shipping off of [an internet auction], most prices are around [$$-$$] for a new one on [internet auction], look around and you will find one for cheap. if you have a toddler who does not really know what christmas is, get him/her something else and buy one for them after christmas when they are cheaper and in stock instead of wasting money now."
2,THE ULTIMATE BRAIN MASSAGE!,"This CD is simply breath taking.Universal is the disc you play after you've had one of those days that causes you to shut yourself away from the world for a few hours to relax,meditate,and re-gather your senses.I strongly recomend this CD to lovers of deep- melodic-lovemaking-head-massaging-relaxation music.(It's also the ultimate sleep soundtrack!)GURANTEED SATISFACTION!!"
1,Invicta Mens 8932,I wasn't impressed with this watch and have returned it. Stupidly ordered it with out reading the numerous bad reviews. Like many of the reveiws i later read the cyclops on this watch wasn't straight and it felt cheap. (guess you get what you pay for?) Bought a Seiko SKX007K insted which I love.
1,Priced Way Too High,"I'm not sure what's going on with this product. Yes, it's the same great product, and for the flavored versions offered on Amazon, all of the prices are fine. But for some reason lately the most popular regular flavored NoPudge, is not only over priced, it is abou5 50% higher than what you have to pay at the store - typically $3.50/box. There are one or two come-on low ball offers here, that are not prime, but then they throw on about $10 for shipping which still takes them out of sight. If you have the option of picking this item up at your local grocery story, there is no way you should be spending more than $20 - $22 delivered for a pack of 6, for any of the NoPudge line"
2,Lord of the Wu Tang,This movie is the best Jet Li martial arts flick I have ever seen. The story starts out with action and leaves you wanting more. The little bit of disappointments were that its subtitled and some parts are unreadable & that the ending left me hanging. From beginning to end it was great. I even tried getting the DvD version but it got put on back order and then never came. If you like this movie you might also want to try The New Legend of Shaolin.
1,American Anthem,"The cover leads you to believe you are buying a Denyce Graves CD. Don't believe it. She only sings in 3 songs. The rest of the CD is an amalgamation of old, worn out recordings (e.g., Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops). If you want to appreciate the real Denyce Graves....pass up this CD and head to the Opera section."
1,slurp smack gulp snort pop belch wheeze slop moist,"I dony like campbell scott's phlegmy, lisping, lip smacking, nose breathing performance. The c, sh, sk, t and p sounds are harsh , shrill and overwrought. The s sounds like a hissing snake. He over enunciates every consonant in a ridiculous manner, placing more emphasis on perfect diction than on the meaning or nuance of the words themselves. overall this recording is a hideous mangling of king's classic. I wish stephen king had read this himself. He always does the best job. campbell scott should never be allowed near a microphone again. actually he should never be allowed to speak to anyone again, ever."
2,one of the best albums of the decade,I didn't think this CD was all that when I bought it but now I listen to it and it's truly an r&b classic of the 2000's and much better than the other music out there today though she's following the footsteps of many musical legends that came before her and inspired her. She writes beautiful piano hooks and sings beautiful melodies with her gorgeous voice and that's what makes all those grammys mean something.
1,Weak because so much is not comics,"The weaknes of this book (and sections of Ricks Story) is not its controversial content but the fact that Sim basically rejects the comics format (which he does well) for page after page of dense badly written (though not as bad as the section in Ricks Story)prose with a single illo per page. If this dialogue was writtten and presented in a comics format it would have been hopefully stripped down ,edited and more readable . As it is it is a real slog and not really worth the effort. A real mess."
1,I waited two years for this?,"I'm very disappointed... a couple suprising things happen, out of 600+ pages of the first WoT novel I've actually found hard to stay with. It took me a few days to finish it, since I kept getting bored with the lack of plot advancement. RJ, we know you can do better than this. You've proven it, so why are you leaving us with virtually nothing new until book #11?"
1,I HATE THEM!!!!,"When I first saw them at the store I thought... nah, they look like they leak. So I bought elite from evenflo. Well my dear mother in law arrived to visit us one day with 7 of these bottles, so to be polite I sterilized one and used it. My daughter hated it because she was used to the wide nipple and I hated it myself because the bottom wouldn't stop leaking. Plus, the nipple collapsed. Can't store made formula in them, can't use them with a bottle warmer, and so on.I wonder if the bottles were tested at all."
1,Demonstrating the Pulfrich effect,The dinosaur animation is rudimentary (nothing like 'Jurassic Park' or 'Walking With Dinosaurs') and the video quality variable. Mainly useful as a demonstration of the Pulfrich effect (darker images take longer to reach the brain): the 3D sequences are quite successful.
2,An overwhelmingly positive view of Christian sexuality.,"This book is probably the single best evangelical marriage manual on the market, complete with explicit but tastfully done drawings and unflinching examinations of various sexual issues. The contextualizing of sex into the larger sphere of marital relationships is especially helpful; communications between husband and wife about sex or anything else can be greatly improved if one heed's Rosenau's parameters for communication."
2,Soul Stirring!,"Beautiful! I recently bought Kate Price's Cd's, ""Isle of Dreaming"" and ""Deep Heart's Core"". Her voice, lyrics, and melodies took me home to ""Avalon"". Soul stirring and enchanting! It would be unfair to compare Ms Price to Loreena Mckennitt or Enya, she has a style of her own that cannot be compared to any other. However, if you love Loreena and Enya, you will absolutely love Kate Price...she is in the same league of talent and spirituality. I highly recommend you purchase her work, it shall stir the ancient soil within your soul, you will be transformed! Bravo and a standing ovation to Kate Price! Blessed Be."
2,make over for a classic,"The game is pretty fun, but i wouldn't say it's as great as the classic sims. I just couldn't get as hooked on it, but maybe thats because I'm older. What i did love is how much more editing you could do, with house and people and even the things you buy. It also had a real effect of how the sims reacted to things and you could just make a story about the sims all together. I'm sure if i was young i could really get in to this alot more because when i did play it, i had alot of fun."
2,Many features in an Ultra small unit,"I bought EX-S500 and although I didn't get such a good deal on the price, I held on to it because it is extreemly versatile. Mpeg 4 quality videos and a Lithium Hydride battery which under a full charge yields almost limitless power. I used it for three days, took 65 videos + 255 photos and it still had 3/4 power left. CCD image quality is excellent."
1,"Pompous, full of false promises","Unfortunately, the book does not deliver what it promises. The author indicates a new method of interpreting the quatrains, i.e. the Green Language. As with most writers about Nostradamus, however, he spends a great deal of time with a posteriori predictions (""postdictions""). If he has truly found a new way of accurately interpreting the quatrains, then why is he not able to provide predictions? The author makes a lame argument that Nostradamus, himself, specifically wrote in a manner to make predictions impossible. Additionally, the author writes in the first person plural, which I found incredibly pompous and annoying. Save your money."
1,kodak ph40,printed about 10 to 15 photos with both cartridges and they both went dry.Its no wonder why this product is hard to find
1,I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky,"I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky.I am happy that author came from and was a member of the Parisian intelligencia and was able to hold discourse with the cream of society. He then was able to afford to go to Nepal to study Tibetan Buddism and supported himself. This took him quite a number of pages to say. By the time he was ready to discuss the book's subject, I was quite depressed and could read no further. This negated the promise and premise of the book for me."
1,disappointed on two counts,Disappointment #1: My opener will not charge enough to even open one bottle. Not one single bottle.Disappointment #2: My daughter bought this for me for Christmas. She's a college student who works hard for her money and I feel like she wasted it.
1,sits too upright for newborns,"I didn't notice how much more upright the Delightful Dream Bouncer was than other bouncers until we assembled it, tossed the box away & attempted to use it. In other words, too late to return to the store. It was totally useless until our daughter was around 2 months old. I then realized that all the activity stuff comes up from the left side, and my daughter couldn't reach the play things with her right hand at all, which she tends to favor. Unless you have a left-handed newborn who can sit upright soon after they are born, this bouncer isn't a good choice. I highly recommend buying the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncer instead. My daughter LOVES it! You can use it right after your baby is born and it will definitely keep their interest!"
2,better than a high chair,"This chair is great if it fits your table, and if you don't mind some damage to your table. We've been using them for 2 years, and they're holding up great. I bought our table knowing it would take some damage, so I don't really care. It's nice to not have to clean the floor around chair legs. The seat has been washed many times, and always gets quite clean, and isn't showing signs of wear."
2,A good solid read with lots of action and suspense,"Good plot and a fast moving storyline that is sure to provide terrorists with plenty of new targets to think about. An equal mix of adrenaline and testosterone that feels like a season script for the TV show ""24"" - or maybe a Bruce Willis miniseries.The writing is solid but the author has the annoying habit of referring to the September 11 / World Trade Center attacks so many times (nearly every other page in the first 50 pages - and much more towards the end), that this reader got tired of it. It is as if he keeps doing a George W. Bush impression-repeating Sept. 11 as a Mantra, trying unsuccessfully to push emotional buttons without reason-and looking stupid because of it.Not my favorite book by Peneiro, but a good solid read with lots of action and suspense."
1,Yawn. . .,Don't even plan on seeing this movie. I went to go see it in the theater basicly because I wanted to see it so bad and I did. You know what I didn't like this movie at all. I thought it was boring and depressing. The acting was pretty good except the movie was terrible. If I were you don't even plan on renting it or buying it on video you might not like it.
1,The book to skip,"After reading the Hiram Key, I was all to excited to run on down to a local store and buy this book. It is informative to a point, but the author has gone so deep into his own exhaustive personal experience that I found it almost unreadable.Great author but this book is one to skip unless you prefer absolute tedium."
1,i still have not recieved this item. i am very dissappointed,i have been waiting for this item for over a month. it supposedly was lost in the mail and was reordered on the 17th of march and i still dont have it. i wont order from amazon ever again
2,New Innkeeper,"This book is a valuable tool for those just getting started, or wondering if innkeeping is cut out for them. The checklist and resources listed are very helpful."
1,esther williams in love with esther williams,"good grief it must have been hard to make these movies with out co stars.she told directors how to direct,swimmers how to swim,designed costumes filled and cleaned the pool and still had time to slander a man who loved her. and on top of all this she gave up her 3 children for a guy who had a greatpenis. how lucky we are to have her."
1,Even an elephant could forget this one,"The writer and director also takes the lead role... a recipe for disaster. The story idea is a good one that could possibly lead to comedy, but it hasn't worked too well here.If you're a fan of Jennifer Esposito, be warned that she has a very minor role in this movie."
2,Great Book of knowledge,"I recommend this book to anyone that wants to know the gossip on how the latest figure skaters got to where they are today. With lots of great pictures of all stars including Michelle Kwan, Sarah Huges, Irina Slutskya, Elvis Stojko, Alexei Yagudin and much much more from all around the world."
2,The impossible happens!,"Fans of Ben Webster, please note: for perhaps the only time in his brilliant career, Ben finds himself out-balladed. Coleman Hawkins, the father of the tenor, steps up to the mike on 'It Never Entered my Mind' and outplays the greatest balladeer in jazz history. It's a thrilling solo. Ben is, of course, glorious, the rhythm section is blue-chip (the Peterson trio plus drums), and the interplay between the two horns (especially the gorgeous unison melody playing on 'La Rosita') is breathtaking. Mainstream jazz at its finest, and an essential purchase for any jazz -- any music -- lover."
1,waste of money,Starts with promise but spirals downhill quickly. Unbelievable characters and an ending that made my eyes roll.
1,sketchy concept overview w/ many wrong answers.......,"I grabbed this book from my local library to do some brushing up on some old high school concepts before reviewing some more serious calculus. There is very little intuitive development for what ""may"" be intended as prep material for standardized tests such as the ACT or GRE. For example, the proofs for geometrical volumes or surface areas are laughable at best,if existent at all. As an electrical engineer, I feel very confident in the answers I obtained...especially after double checking my own scratch work. I am seriously considering writing my own book based on the material that was thrown into this one....."
2,Rose Hill Rocks,"I purchased this movie as a gift. Not only was I surprised at how swiftly I recieved the order, but that it was in such great condition. The person to whom I gave it thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
2,One of my favorites!,I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the new 5 Day Slim Down DVD! Leslie does moves I haven't seen her do in any of her other videos - I love it! Each mile provides an excellent workout! I also like that she does the workout alone. I hope Leslie makes more DVDs like this one. I also think it's great that I can customize my workout!
1,PLEASE READ THE BAD REVIEWS,I HAVE HAD THIS PUMP FOR ABOUT A MONTH. IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS GREAT. BUT ABOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT IT I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS. I HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINTS AS THE OTHERS. ITS EXTREMELY NOISY. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SUCTION ON BOTH SIDES. IT LOSES SUCTION WHILE PUMPING. THE BREAST CUPS LEAK BECAUSE OF THE LOSE OF SUCTION. THE MOTOR SOMETIMES SOUNDS LIKE ITS GOING TO QUIT. IN THE BEGINNING IT EMPTIED MY BREASTS AND I PUMPED A LOT OF MILK. BUT NOW IT'S NOT EMPTYING MY BREASTS. READ THE BAD REVIEWS!!!! I WONDER IF THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PUMP FOR A SHORT TIME AND HAVEN'T USED IT ENOUGH. SPEND THE MONEY AND GET A GOOD PUMP LIKE MEDELA OR AMEDA. YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL IT USED ON EBAY AND GET SOME OF YOUR MONEY BACK.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY.,"I bought this CD player about four months ago, and although it worked okay, it ate up batteries and skipped a lot--just walking would trigger it. This CD player is NOT AT ALL good for jogging or working out, because you won't even be able to hear the music with any movement. After dropping it once, it stopped playing ANY CDs, responding with ""NO DISK."" This product is a complete waste of money, and now I can't even return it because my warranty up. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
2,Very helpful during a stressful time,"I bought this CD for my cats for Christmas. During the holidays one of my cats began losing her battle with heart disease. We basically hospiced her until she died peacefully. This CD seemed to really calm her and the rest of the cats (as well as me). Once I began playing it for her, she seemed more relaxed and comfortable. It helped us all out during a rough time. I play it still for my other cats who really do seem to listen. If you have a cat, you should give this a try. The music is all very beautiful and well performed."
1,Yes It is old,It is a great camera. Easier to use than most modern cameras. Does not have a dedicated waterproof housing//Attachment like telephoto can be found if you look under a hay stack. Picture quality is somewhat lousy. Find and carry spare parts good. Has a butterfly screw. Impossible to take apart. Got sand in camera and fuji refused to take apart at any price. Yes it is an old camera. If the funds allow buy a more modern camera and send your old 510 to me BUS. I purrchased an old fuji camera for @ $100.00. Paying more is not worth it any condition. Need flood lamps for dark video and stills at night.
1,Music,"This is okay, kinda disappointing after reading some of the other reviews actually. Music selection is...? I'm not sure who the music is meant to be motivating for. I guess its always subjective.Good concept but to listen to it day after day? Just give me some hot music to pace me."
2,funny,i thought that this movie was funny.It first started out when these two guys got fired then a robber comes into a resturant where they were and the guy played by robbin williams is shot by the robber and the robber escapes.the movie keep on getting better
1,Way too fast and not enough instruction,"I was looking for clear step by step instructions to improve my form. This instructor performs the moves way too fast, making it impossible to follow grasp what he is doing. To make it useful I will need pause and rewind a lot."
2,Pretty thorough and great camera angles!,"This is one of those outlines a lot of the basics of which we urban Americans often lose track. The camera angles and inside information gathered by the show often surprised me as I was watching the show, and I found it quite enjoyable. However, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they didn't thoroughly cover each subject, and I especially thought the manufacturing episode was rather weak. The data presenting in that episode didn't support the documentary's conclusions very well. Additionally, they only mention hydroelectric power in passing during the electric episode.Overall: definitely recommend to watch for a broad, and perhaps enlightening perspective. However, don't expect any detailed or thought provoking analysis of the subjects."
1,Buy this book and the authors will get what THEY want EVERY time!!!,"I cannot believe that this book gets 4 stars. It is about the value of putting on a carny magic show to distract the customer, which somehow leads to them buying the product (without telling you how it leads to them buying the product). It doesn't work. This book has nothing to do with persuasion but is about performing sales presentations like a carny hawking rides at the circus. DO NOT BUY if you are serious about sales!!!"
1,BLACK AND WHITE YAWN-FEST,"This is what I hate about bad films; the people who instantly see anything that is slow as a snail and black and white as ""ART"". Make no doubt about it, THE SEVENTH SEAL is a bad, slow, colorless movie. A knight from who knows where plays chess against death. That's it, the whole movie, and it takes 2 hours to get there. Do yourself a favor and rent a good movie like GO or AUSTIN POWERS 2 instead. At least they were in color..."
1,Disapointing,"Our dishwasher had a lot of soap buildup to the point that the main dispenser doesn't open up when it should and our dishes aren't getting very clean. I've looked online and tried a few methods (tang, vinegar, etc...) to no avail. So, I found a couple cleaners online and thought we would give them a try. I stared with Dishwasher Magic and had high hopes. When the cycle finished the bottle was empty but the inside of the washer hadn't changed. The detergent build up was still there. Moving on to the next one..."
2,me me me me,"The title of this review is the theme music of our times. Even though it was written more than 20 some odd years ago it's content still rings just as true today as it did in its first year. As a student of psychoanalytic social-work I find the ""Culture of Narcissism"" to be one of the most relevent works of our age. It clarifies the nature of so much of what is a part of our social and psychological dysfuction."
1,"Not really a review, but I had to get this out of my system.","I tried to read the book when it first came out several years ago. I got about one-third of the way through it before giving up and donating it to the church rummage sale. Hated it. Wouldn't watch this movie on a bet.The appeal of the whole thing escapes me. Maybe a lot of women approach it (mistakenly) thinking it's some kind of life-affirming sisterhood female bonding thing.It showed up in my recommendations for some reason, that's what set off this rant. Thanks for letting me vent my spleen. I would've rated it zero stars, but that doesn't appear to be an option."
1,Where are my entries?,"I wrote ckecks that have dissapeared from the check register. After reading the previous reviews of this program, I can understand why."
1,Small capacity--needs service in less than 1 yr.,"I bought this dishwasher with the idea of being able to use just the top drawer for most days, when it is just my husband and me. And that is the one good thing about it, and I think it does clean better because there is only one rack for each spray arm. Large dinner plates don't fit in either drawer. Tall glasses don't fit anywhere, same with deep cereal or salad bowls, unless you can get away with only putting 3 in there. The silverware basket came apart when I was carrying it to the drawer to put away, and clean flatware went all over the floor. My husband epoxyed the thing together so it wouldn't happen again. There is no sani- cycle, which I think would be a real asset, with grandchildren / pets in the household. Today it started flashing an error message, that translates into ""the flood switch has been activated, call service center"" Great! it is not even filled with water, and both dishwashers are in failure mode..."
1,"Hmm, not so great.","This book was assigned to me in a graduate level library and information science class called Multi-Cultural Literature for Children and Young Adults. I was rather disappointed with this book. The author seems to have done very little original research and instead quotes extensively (too much) from many other researchers in the field. I also did not like the author's take on what multi-cultural literature is and how it should be handled in a class room setting. There were many more negative things I could say, but it would take too long here."
1,WORTHLESS,"THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THIS CAMERA HAS TO OFFER IS IT'S SIZE. TOO MANY DISADVANTAGES TO MENTION. HERE ARE JUST A FEW: 1)LCD BUILT INSIDE THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF THE OUTSIDE. 2)TERRIBLE PICTURES WITH RECOMENDED SETTINGS(VERY BLURRY). 3)NIGHT SHOOTINGS ARE TERRIBLE (FLASH IS USELESS). 4)TO SNAP A PICTURE, YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS BEFORE IT CAPTURES THE IMAGE YOU ARE SHOOTING. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! DON'T LET IT'S SMALL SIZE CAPTIVATE YOU .... I PERSONALLY WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE."
1,Straps hurt,"Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short. I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work. I had to give the shoes away. The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable. Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side."
2,UN LIBRO PARA TODA LA VIDA,"Este libro te establece y refuerza los hábitos con los que podemos apreder a ser felices, aún pasaNdo tribulaciones y experiencias te puedes mantener feliz para toda la VIDA"
2,An Animation Tour de Force,"Maybe something of a SPOILER at the end.Paprika is fast paced and beautifully animated. At times it is a little difficult to understand, but if you pay attention you should be able to follow along. If you like the previous works of Satoshi Kon then I think you will like this.Best I can describe is that there is a new technology that allows you to share dreams with other people, someone steals the technology, and dreams and reality start to merge. If you were able to follow along with movies like the Matrix this shouldn't be too difficult."
2,Great Book!,"I met Dr Bergan many years ago... he was a stately elderly man, I was a young woman. I only spoke with him a few times, a few minutes each time... he mentioned this book. I bought the book way back then (around 1969?) for my mother and she loved it. Since then, I raised my family and the years marched on. Nantasket Beach changed... Paragon Park was torn down... the town became rather lethargic... but, lately the town seems to be appreciating it's magnificent location (and the resulting real estate values are appreciating rapidly). I always saw it as a ""miniature Cape Cod""... When my mother passed away, I came across the book and remembered how much she loved it. I've since bought another copy and gave it to one of my sons. I recommend this book as a wonderful, historic account of the mangnificence that Nantasket was at one time... and although those days are gone... I see Nantasket as becomeing magnificent once again, yet quite different from yesteryear."
1,Not what you are looking for,"This bugle is a pretty good deal. There are only a few problems. One is that it is badly out of tune but cannot be tuned (I think that is because of the mouthpiece size, I recommend that you get a standard trumpet mouthpiece). The other problem is that there is no spit valve and therefore no way to drain your spit. Otherwise, it is a very good deal."
2,GREAT CD! I love it!,"The first song on this album had me hooked. I loved the sound of Headroom.Besides bringing us Addicted to Bass, which everyone should know and love if they like the dance circuit, they bring us some other aspect of their style, which is all really good."
1,Faulty listing,"This book has nothing to do with ornithology, and should not be listed with other bird books."
1,Andy Griffith Show Marathon,"Can anyone please list the shows that are included in this DVD? I would like to buy it, but after reading the reviews, I'm not so sure. I had to rate it something, otherwise, it would not post this question."
1,This IS A VERY Distrubing movie.,The ending IS HEART-BREAKING and lingers with you for a long time after watching it. (Maybe I'm just too sensitive(?). It went to an area thrift shop after two watchings.
2,Deserves 6 Stars!,"Dwight's voice is like a knife that tears into my soul with stinging sweetness and his lyrics are mesmerizing. He's a singing storyteller who is in a league of his own. I can hardly articulate what I find most impressive about Dwight, and what appeals to me about this particular album. It's beautifully stark, traditional yet contemporary, the lyrics are honest and descriptive, the production is fine and music first-rate. This album is classic, just like Dwight. Part of the making of a Legend. No wonder Buck Owens and Johnny Cash liked him and thought of him as a worthy successor. He was and still is. I just wonder when he will get the recognition he is due??"
2,Eureka Mighty Mite Vacuum,Great small vacuum. It has great suction power and works well for a small vacuum. Also has atachments and it is easy to find replacement bags!
2,Early Gems!,"A collection of songs from The Cars first and second releases and a favorite rarity of mine, ""Take What You Want"". Their performance is tight, but unpolished, unlike the over-produced, MTV oriented songs of their later years. Some of the transitions between songs are a little rough as the guys change guitars, tinker with amps, grab a drink of beer. I love it.Each member is fun to watch for stage presence and musicianship. I renewed my love of Elliot Easton's guitar genious. Greg Hawkes is fun to watch as he sprinkles the songs with sci-fi/techno sounds. So much out of so little!You can sense from watching this video that the Cars were headin' for big things!"
2,Excellent summer read,Highly entertaining and intelligent. It will make you laugh and think at the same time. A social commentary page turner. Excellent.
1,Spenser led me to expect better,"What a sad-sack this recovering-alcoholic character is. I understand this author's need to branch out, to perhaps prove he can write something beyond ""Spenser""; but Jesse Stone has none of the cleverness, likability or humor of a Spenser. In the first of these I read, the character mentions in passing his acquaintance with Spenser, up in Boston; and my bored-to-tears heart actually started racing with hope, as though a rock star might appear. (Which he didn't.) I have a friend who reads these when there's nothing else, and finds them palatable enough. Sadly, I do not."
2,bo jackson raiders jersey w/o the raiders logo,Jersey is as described. Material is made of good quality. Stitching is also surprisingly good quality (doesn't look like cheap patch work for some cheaper jerseys being sold on amzn). Just be aware that there is no Raiders team logo anywhere on the jersey; instead there is a Reebok logo on both sides of the sleeves above the #34. There is however an NFL logo in the center collar.
1,Classic MP3 Player....,"It took me, along with my brother and uncle around 2 hours to get the software for this player to work.. nothing on the CD that came with it worked with MAC OS9, we downloaded what we needed from the internet -- the instructions were obviously not written by ""mac people"" .. after 2 hours (of translating the instructions), we got it set up - uploaded a song and realized the headphone connection was bad.. or something.. it sounded ok, but if you moved the player, or the cord the sound would cut out or it would only play out of one headphone.. ( i tried 4 pairs of headphones .. same problem) I returned it. if it had worked.. it would have been great.."
2,A must read for Puzzle lovers,"This book is a must read for those interested in puzzles.Written by Shakuntala Devi the world famous mathematicalgenius from India. she is a self taught prodigy who neverhad any formal education.she is also known as the human computer.This is a book of puzzles, and the puzzles in this book are intresting and will involve the reader while solving them.the puzzles are short in length but will force you to exercise your brain,and use your logical skills.the puzzles are of a wide range from the modern ones to those from an ancient text.there are 150 puzzles in this book, and they vary from simple ones to the more difficult ones.they are intresting even for those who are not skilled in maths.alltogether,a good book with which one can pass some time,trying these puzzles."
1,disappointed,i usually love David McCullogh and this book was disappointing. i have 1776 and John Adams and i thought that this would be great as well. i just ordered Truman from you and i hope that falls into the great category again.
2,Review if Logitech Wireless Rollerball Mouse,"It is the first ""roller-ball"" mouse I have ever purchased and it did take a little getting use to as it different from another mouse. but I would recommendit. However, the range, since it is wireless was a little disappointing. Since I am at a split level computer desk, I have to keep the receiver on the upper level fairly close if I want the mouse to stay response. I would not suggest it for easy portability for say a lap top as hauling the reciever around with it could be a bit cumbersome."
2,Well Researched!,I am an avid reader & particularly enjoy Christian-fact-moving-attention grabbing books. This is one of those. I thought it was well researched and put together. I am waiting for a sequel!
2,Hello panda,I liked the product. Hello Panda was pretty fresh when i got it. It should have been more in the box. Especially if you pay 1.49 for the product and then shipping. But overall pretty good product.
2,Still worth the purchase,"I couldn't resist trying one of these, inspite of the mixed reviews. It's true they don't give off much light, (but that's how LEDs are), and they may not restick to multiple surfaces over and over again, (although my third ""restick"" is still affixed and seems fine), but they are helpful for some things. I originally tried them under the counter, but they're not bright enough for that. My husband suggested placing one in our bathroom for those middle-of-the-night pit stops when you're half asleep and don't want to turn on a bright light, so that's what we did. And in power outages, they'll be great to have around."
2,Abstract and darkly passionate,"This record was a major challenge to both the traditionalists and the emerging avant-garde. Jeanne Lee was a pioneer of avant-garde singing, graced with a haunting, hypnotic voice. Ran Blake's piano explores the internal structures of harmonies with delicate colourations. The Newest Sound Around is an intriguing, strange mesh of piano and vocal sounds delivered with a passionate tenderness.The novel approach contrasts strikingly with the material: standards such as ""Summertime"" and ""Lover Man"", and traditional gospel such as ""Motherless Child"". But this is the great idea behind the album: new sounds will penetrate the unprepared ear more profoundly if wrought from familiar material.The album cover boldly proclaimed that this music ""may well be the beginning"" of ""an enduring new wave in jazz styling"". Well, by definition, no new wave can be enduring, nor should it be. Jeanne Lee remains one of jazz's most original, individual and compelling vocalists."
1,Useless after a week,"Spend your $16 on a weeks worth of bottled water instead of this. Water actually tastes worse after going through it. Someone in a previous review had a good tip: turn the water on to run slowly through the filter allowing it to properly pass through the charcoal and it will greatly improve the taste. The problem is, who has time to wait 20-30 seconds every time I need water.My advice, buy a proper under-sink filter and don't waste your money and time on this one."
2,Awesome book!! Again and back again,Read this first when I was 9 and fell in love with the genre from this point on... Reading it to my own child now... And he's spell bound and I'm thoroughly enjoying the wonderful tale Tolkien spins once again.
1,Christian fundamentalism!,"This is NOT a book that someone should care to read, that is, unless you are a cynical fundamentalist Christian who believes that whatever is not ""good Christian values"" is the sign of the Devil. There are plenty of better books out there that deals with religious perspectives on UFOs in general and extraterrestrials in particular.Dailey believes that ALL occult and New Age movements have one thing in common; destroy Christianity. No wonder people turn their backs on a religion that refuses to accept other values. It is not an investigative book, but rather a Christian manifesto filled with Bible citations and cynical ideas.People shouldn't talk about Satanism unless they know what they're talking about, and Dailey clearly does not. Don't bother buying it."
2,EXCELLENT! A MUST READ FOR THOSE WITH MVPS,This is by far the best book I have read on MVPS. I feel so relieved to know that anxiety/panic attacks can be a part of this syndrome. This should definately be a required text for those newly diagnosed with MVPS. It is a life-saver. Thanks a million!!!
1,Low brow vegan reading,The book makes veganism seem masochistic and it's based on junk science. It's just a different way to capitalize on people's insecurities. Read the other negative reviews and you'll get the picture.
1,"not as advertised,",I only received Animorphs #32. I thought I was receiving the set #32-#37 as advertised. If one book was all that I was to receive then the description should have been clearer.
1,Do not adjust your controller....,"My whole family played this game over the christmas holiday.... NONE of us could get the controls to work right while playing the mini-games. Don't waste your money. If you want an interactive family game, do Wii sports or Super Swing Golf or one of the driving games."
2,lots of easy ways to look and feel better,"Thanks, Gary, for the chance to look and feel better and younger. Your advice is easy to follow and makes sense to me. I may not live forever but as long as I live I plan to feel and look as good as I can"
2,Actual Rating - 4.5 stars. ( They really need to consider a 1/2 star rating system! ),"The second release by this Danish / American power metal band shows the band improving in both the song writing and the song structuring process. Fantastic guitar work woven in with keyboards ( w/ the guitars at the forefront ), a very capable rythm section, and yet another outstanding vocal performance from Lance King make this album a winner. The pieces of this band are really starting to come together on this album and it shows. Fans of melodic power metal, purchase immediately!"
2,GREAT TOY!!,"We received this for our daughter's 1st birthday and she LOVES it!! At first we thought she wouldn't be able to ride it yet since she isn't walking, but she had no problems. This is a GREAT toy and I would HIGHLY recommend it."
1,The subtitles are invisible much of the time,"The subtitles are invisible much of the time because they are all-white (with no frames around the letters), so they become invisible against the background. (The movies in itself is amusing, with excellent acting.)"
1,a bunch of cheesy songs,i dont reccomend this cd the songs all sound the same and after listening to it for a while they dont even sound good so unless u like bad songs and chessy songs with no heart put into them then buy the cd if u like good music buy something else if your really desperate for a different cd no offense to bsb becuase im a very big fan but i think N Sync's cd is even better than this cd
2,Works great!,"Not sure what to say about this except that it works great for my husband, who is a beginner guitar player. We have it sitting on carpet in a somewhat heavy traffic area of our home and have never had any problems with it."
1,Can It Really Be So Bad?,"I wanted to learn more about post colonial studies because it is research interest of my girlfriend. Definitely not finding any merit in PC studies from this book which reads more like a cheap leftist political tract than anything like a textbook, as other reviewers have indicated.Pretty funny when author asks in the introduction ""how many faces of power can you think of that are brown?"" ... also in introduction ""There was a time when any book you might read, any speech you might read, any film you saw was told from the point of view of the male."" From here I am assuming the book only gets better and better."
2,The Ipod Killer,"No need to write a long review. This is the best hard drive MP3 player you can buy AND, at the current Amazon price, it is now also competitively priced. Add it to your cart and check-out, you won't regret it."
1,ripped off,I received the 3 DVD boxed set of That's Entertainment and it doesn't work! We've tried these DVD's in many players and they do not work! Disappointed to say the least!
2,Favorite Christmas Movie,We have an old colorized VHS version of this movie and I wanted to upgrade to a DVD. It's the only movie we have watched in which I have seen my husband cry.
2,"If you hae an XBOX 360 Wireless Controller and not this, GET THIS","I thought my wireless controller would connect to the PC with no problem, then I found out I needed a wireless receiver for an XBOX360 controller. I then ordered this and for half of my pc gaming experience this has been so helpful.I recommend anyone with a wireless 360 controller to get one of these receivers for PC Gaming, I've had it for over a year and still glad I got it :)"
1,Failure To The Extreme,"It would be nice to get a simulation game that ACTUALLY installs properly on start up. This Civ2 game is a total dud in it's ability to function on standard operating systems. My brother has a Gateway with window95: results, winload G Error 2I have a Packard Bell with windows98: results, winload G Error 2My dad has a Emachines with windows ME: results winload G Error 2It's strange for a CD bought at Amazon.com to have the same error message that gives the cd the same inability to run on 3 totally different computers and operating systems... ironic? I don't think so... Personal Installation mistake? Are you Kidding? since there is virtually no way to make a mistake pressing installation buttons on any of the cd-roms sold today. Upon inspection of the CD, it's spotless... but the compatibility leaves something to be desired."
2,nice,nice little radar for the money. does what it says it does. kind of loud and sends alerts right away.
2,Wonderful Book,"We read this book for our education class at the University of Mississippi. Although this book is aimed for children ages 12-13, it is good for any age. Hattie Campbell explains her adventures in such a way that it motivates anyone who is reading this book to become interested in the westward movement. As teacher candidates, we quickly realized that this book could be integrated into all subject areas. This book helps children of today relate with Hattie and the struggles she faced in the 1800's. This selection is an easy read and once started you will not want to put it down until the last page is read."
1,so-so quality,"Compared to other #5 padded envelopes I have purchased, these are of so-so quality. For this batch, the bubbles in the back top middle part of the envelopes are almost always flat."
2,A fun read that tackles deeper issues,"I really liked this. Even though the premise was a bit 'out there', I think I can see where the author wants to push the envelope to get her points across. I found that while reading it, I reexamined my own friendships, thankful that those who i surround myself with are real true friends who would only want good things for me. I have had my share of toxic friends and this book really brought home how damaging they can be. I liked Scarlett's character even though i did want to slap her and tell her to smarten up."
2,"If Stranded with Only 2 Cookbooks, This Would Be One!","Without a doubt, this book delivers. Easy, tasty food from the very best chefs. Try the Roasted Peppers, Potatoes and Onions or any of the Pork recipes.A real favorite. In fact, I find myself going back to this over and over again, and am never disappointed."
2,Certainly not Rotten!,"This is a great cast recording, not amazing, but great. Norbert Leo Butz is fantastic and surely deserved the Tony award and he and John Litgow together is a stellar team. I am a fan of Butz and Sherie Rene Scot from their ""The Last Five Years"" days, so getting to hear them sing in the same show again is a real treat. This is a great buy!"
2,A way to evaluate Farmer's credibility,"Tracy Kidder's recent book Mountains Beyond Mountains was written entirely about Farmer and his life of unswerving, almost overwhelming devotion to the sick of Haiti in particular and of the third world in general. While Farmer comes across as a bit naive (while at the same time incredibly intelligent and quite cynical) or excessively saintly, the chance that he is simply a mouthpiece for Aristide who wants to line his own pockets seems to me to be less than zero."
1,Jumping on the bandwagon,"This book is shockingly bad. It is appallingly written, has very little content, many errors, and is highly repetitive. By the author's own admission, it is merely a collection of facts gathered from published articles and interviews, and official and unofficial web sites; in other words, Marc Shapiro has found an easy way to make easy money, by gathering public information (and not very much of it) in a short, unsatisfactory book riddled with errors (Knight's Cross Station in London? There is no such place, in reality or Rowling's fiction.) If you really want to know as much about JK Rowling as you can, this book is perhaps easier than your own internet research, but do not expect to discover anything new or surprising, do not expect to enjoy the read, and bear in mind that Joanne Rowling has not validated a single word in the book."
1,Zombie-ish,"I was very much looking forward to this release. As big fan starting back with ""Tea for the Tillerman"" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed ""A is for Allah"", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,""An Other Cup"" is unlistenable.Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of ""A is for Allah"" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Elton John is one of a handful of preeminent songwriter/performers of the past half century. His work will be held as a standard for any individual who sits on a piano bench and puts his face to a microphone. About this album -- where is the sinew and muscle from this man's career? The albums ""Tumbleweed Connection,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" contained masterpiece material. Where in the world is ""Burn Down the Mission,"" ""Love Lies Bleeding,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Good Lord knows how many others. Here's the question -- Who picked this stuff?"
1,busted,"The band broke during the 1st week.... I probably could have sent it back, but didn't feel like the hassle..."
2,The greatest and only Norma after Callas,"Well what can one say about the greatest performance by Montserrat Caballe? She herself regards this Norma to be the greatest performance of her career. It was she who asked the greatest Norma of the 20th century, Maria Callas, for advice and suggestions as to how to do it justice. Caballe was in miraculous form that night. This is maybe the greatest ""Casta Diva"" since the miraculous recordings by Ponselle (1930ties) and Callas (1949, what a BEAUTIFUL voice young Callas had) Callas middle was her forte, it remained rich and luscious to the end, even after she lost her top after 1958-1959 it shone still. (Listen to the Toscas and Medeas in the sixties) It's ignorant to say that Callas' middle was a mess. But since this is done by a foolish Callas-Basher, what do you expect? And yes, after 1964 Sutherlands middle (Unlike her crystal-clear topnotes) became cloudy, muddy, mushy and messy. Stop attacking those who like Callas. You're making a fool of yourself."
1,Reason Why Hip-Hop is Dying....,"Let's explore Young Jeezy and ask a few questions.Can Jeezy spit 16 bars that rhyme? NOCan Jeezy distinguish between a verse and a hook? NODoes Jeezy explore other topics other than trapping, pimping, and killing? NOHas Jeezy ever killed anybody? NODoes your little sister or brother rap better than Jeezy? YESCan Jeezy battle with Nas/Jay-Z/Eminem and win? NOCan Jeezy battle a brick an win? NODoes Jeezy provide a negative influence for kids? YESWill Jeezy ever be a legend? NO. There are far better artist in the South."
1,Beware the Mole,"My seven year old daughter fell in love with this game. However, when you forget to save correctly when turning the game off, a horrible little mole comes out. It tells my child she is dumb, a punk, and dirt. It got to the point that she would cry if she forgot to save correctly, knowing this horrible little mole would come out. I have no idea why a child's game would include such an unforgiving character. What child hasn't forgotten to save a game correctly. Especially considering every other game on her Nintendo can simply be turned off when she is done. We finally sold this game, not being able to put up with the horrible rants of this little character. I do not recommend this mainly due to this aspect. Otherwise, the game is great. But, it is just so upsetting that this had to be added to a child's game. Beware the nasty mole!"
1,trite and predictable,"This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and guessed the plotline from the bookjacket summary... not surprisingly, I guessed correctly a very predictable storyline. Though love-obsession is a scary situation to be in, Sparks' writing did not make me feel compassion or empathy for protagonist Julie. I found all of the characters to be very shallow and not well-developed, mostly stereotypical.Sparks' writing style is clean but uninspired, filled with stock phrases and a bland rhythm (the shouts aren't shouts, the italicized thoughts don't have any weight). Hope that standard writing formula isn't prevalent through all of his books, if I should ever read another book of his again."
2,Subtle Charmer,"Okay, it took a while for this album to grow on me, but wow! once it did, it simply knocked me out! The album is a bit on the long side (over an hour) but weaves in psychedelia, reggae, electronica, classical, funk, avant-garde, and personal politics all into a kaleidescope of colors and tones that will have you humming at the most unusual times of day. After a few listens, you will very likely find yourself actually relaxing more each time you listen. They may not get the press of groups like air, but they have easily as much talent..."
2,I am pleased!,"After two years on the origional battery, I am ordering a replacement as my first generation kindle is needing frequent charging---every ten hours or so. Needless to say, I'm am pleased and hope the second battery works as well."
1,Amp turns on after music....,"I purchased this amp based on the great customer reviews. It is the most frustrating piece of musical equipment I have ever worked with. I do alot of recording and it's impossible due to the fact that the amp does not turn on until there is a signal sent to it, therefore you never hear the first few beats of a song when you press play. It sucks. What a waste of $100. I guess I should have splurged on a higher quality amp."
2,Helpful,"I am costarrican and my boyfriend is from U.S, he has a very hard time understanding costarrican spanish when he comes to Costa Rica and it's very hard for me to translate and explain very typical stuff like ""bombas"". I bought it and shipped it to him and now he has a lot of fun reading it. I think is gonna be much easier next time he comes. He says the book needs a ""costarrican bad words"" section...lol"
2,Ta-Dah cd by Scissor Sisters,This cd has a good selection of pop music including some danceable tunes. I have listened to it several times and have enjoyed the upbeat and lively tone of the music.
1,See him live instead,"You will hate yourself for buying this, depending on how you feel about blending the line between male and female in various situations, namely while listening to a bald white guy try to sound like Prince. But Har Mar still rocks, and unfortunately this is the best album he has made to prove it."
2,Battery Issues,"In two years light usage I have had two 1.5 Ah batteries show defective on the charger. Makita has stood behind the 12 month warranty and replaced the first battery at 11 months and when that battery read defective 10 months later, they replaced it free of charge. The drill itself is lightweight and an excellent medium duty drill."
2,AMAZING,"This is the best CD I have ever owned in my entire life, not many cd's can you put in the CD player and not skip any songs, and this is one of those CD's. I have the bands first album ""our destiny"" and I see them play all the time, they are some of the nicest guys I have ever met and deffinitley some of the best musicians I know. This CD appeals to all ages and all music lovers in general. No matter what genre you listen to you can't help but love these guys. (...)"
1,Melting Plastic,"Just got my wife a set of stainless steel coorware it came with a ""gift"" set of Calphalon which promptly metlted in the pan and ruined our meal and our cookware."
1,Burlesque,"Had a chance to catch up with this movie last night on ABC Family. I remember seeing the commercials when it was released in theaters and was excited about going to see it, but somehow, never got to get there. I'm glad I saw it on tv. While the musical numbers and Christina's voice were wonderful, the movie itself was not very good. The dialogue, awful. Love story, weak. I was impressed by Christina's talent and Cher looks good. What it did do for me is give me more confidence about my hope to be a screenwriter one day. Because if this movie could be made with such talented stars with the awful excuse for dialogue that was used, I should be successful. When I went to bed last night there was a part of me that did want to buy it for my collection, because I did like the musical numbers. But then the sane part of me reminded me that I just saw it for free on ABC Family, so it will be on again."
2,Keeps the cold out.......,"This product worked better than I expected. We live in an old house with old windows that leak cold air in. I sealed the windows in the winter and then wanted to remove the seal in the summer to install an air conditioner. The caulk came out easily in pretty much one piece. If you may want to remove it later, this is the one to use. I could not find it in any of the usual box stores."
1,"No product received equals zero stars, but it made me give one.",Can't rate what you don't get. Where's the book? Sent supplier note indicating as much. Got a promise for a trace. Haven't heard from him since. I'd go to another supplier.
1,Huh?,"Hello,If you are all saying he is so right, then are you all moving to China? He preaches what a lousy place the USA might be in 15 to 30 years. Are all of you quitting your jobs and starting to buy houses you won't live in that give you money. And starting businesses that you sell later for a profit. Even if you know what he says, and he's right, 95% of the USA will still get squashed. I think I'm missing something here. Why is this a good thing?Matt"
2,All we need now is the video of the previous tour!,"I saw n syncs 'no strings attached' tour recently, i have to say it was the best experience of my life! So when i found out that there was a video of it i had to have it. Its realy realy good, just like the concert, almost word for word! Its definatly worth buying for all nsync fans."
2,What retailers won't tell you.....,"What the retailers won't tell you is that card speed matters if you want more performance out of your digital camera. Most will try and sell you what they have on hand. If your an avid photographer, spend a little more on your CF card to get a little more, you'll be much happier. Point and shoots will be happy with the cheaper models.Research pointed to LEXAR as the leader in CF technology. Good luck and happy picture taking."
1,Awful,What good is it if it makes me burp and taste it all day? Cannot tolerate this. Disappointed. A waste of my hard-earned money.
1,Junky piece of plastic!,"I was so excited to get this vacuum and now I am so disappointed in the product! After only 4 uses, a piece of the handle that holds the hose attachment in place has broken off and now the vacuum cannot be pushed in the upright position. The bulkiness and weight of the vacuum made it tough to handle in the first place, but now it is almost impossible to push it around the room and it is impossible to pull it towards you, without it falling apart! I am totally disappointed in this product. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Experience some gaming history!,"These are indeed old games, and as such, they don't look anywhere near as good as newer games. However, there are a bunch of classics here that should be experienced by any fan of PC gaming. If you love getting immersed inside a virtual world, practically all these games will deliver the goods. And printed manuals? Almost unheard of these days! If you are a true fan and don't mind tweaking your system a bit to get them running, there are hundreds of hours of fun to be had with this massive collection."
1,serious quality problems,"I ordered one of these two months ago, and after playing a couple of DVDs accurately, it began to have very serious problems: the picture would freeze and decompose, the soundtrack would go out of synch. I returned it for a replacement -- and again, after playing 2-3 disks accurately, it has begun to do the same thing. Given the other negative reviews for this product, I imagine this problem (or something like it) is pretty common, not just the occasional lemon. I would not purchase this model unless Panasonic indicates that it has resolved the problem."
1,Broken Words,"I am familiar with the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition and Sacajawea. I bought this book so that my wife could learn about this brave woman and of the fun of Kindle. Both of us struggled through it. The read was confusing at times. It seemed like the first and second halves were written by different people or at different times. But the worse was the messy formatting of the Kindle book! Spelling errors! Badly placed sentence breaks! ...and more!! There was no editing of the final eVersion whatsoever! It was an extremely bad conversion from print to digital. It was very very distracting to encounter so many format and grammatical errors. I would recommend it only if Amazon cleaned it up and then I might give it 3 stars. As it is, not worth one cent!"
1,Not Peter Cushing Movies,"I bought this set to see Peter Cushing.Peter Cushing does not star in these movies-even though one of them says""Starring""-two of them he hardly does much at all-This is deceptive packaging-Not great movies-skip it-"
2,GREAT PRODUCT,"I do alot of tax returns that have lots of graphics. When I used an HP printer, I went through about 5 toners in a sesaon. I've only gone through one TN580 this year. Plus the Brother HL-5240 is much faster than anything I have used in the past. VERY pleased."
1,AR Max is garbage,"This product is a piece of garbage. It is famous for killing memory cards with saved game data, and corrupting them permenatly. In adition, the tech support provide whether it be web based, or live telephone(when they answer) is the worst I have ever encountered. Datel products and service are the worst. In addition to the AR max, I purchased their talknet USB headset for online gaming. The headset does not work with new playstation 2 games. I am told Sony targeted this product, and rendered it useless with programming encoding. Their answer for this is for me to pay postage to mail the product back, and the will try to ""fix"" it and send it back. I dont think so. Buyer beware on anything from this company(Datel)."
1,a politician who thinks he's a scientist,"One thing my father, a physicist, believed strongly was that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Gore proves that whith this book. Do the smart thing and read scientific research if you want to understand the complex issues of global warming and ozone depletion. Gore makes numerous errors and leaps in logic in this book. Don't waste your time or money on it"
1,disgusting!,"this book in my opinion is trash, i read a couple chapters and i had to wash my eyes, alot of un-truths here, the ""author"" claims that crawford walked in on bette davis perfoming fellatio on her husband franchot tone??? disgusting- avoid this lying filth!"
2,great bamboo resource,"I stumbled upon this book before I was about to purchase a bambusa vulgaris. This book was well written, informative and visually appealing. Since, I live out near the water, I needed to know how to care for and successfully grow bamboo in my backyard. With the help of this book, I have maintained a couple of potted bamboo plants outside and a giant one indoors. Helpful to a novice bamboo grower like myself, but also a good reference to keep always."
1,Never stop bleeding,"I've had these chairs for a couple of years now and I can say that I truly dislike them and can't wait to replace them. I have a concrete pool deck and these chairs have never stopped bleeding and still stain the concrete. It's very unsightly, so I have to go through the trouble of moving them off of the concrete before it rains. My wife used an oil sealer on them to try to stop this and it did nothing. I am looking forward to replacing them but we need to try to get through another season or so.I'm giving this product 2 stars because I think they might be fine if they were located in an area where the staining wasn't a problem and also because they are inexpensive (you get what you pay for)."
2,1 less star for the errors,"Here is the good news: I scored 800 thanks to doing all the tests in this book. There is no other book that resembles the actual test better.The bad news is it seems the author was in a little hurry to come up with a publication. The reason is, there are errors that should have been fixed prior to publishing this book. Besides the price a little high.However, this book is still one of a kind."
2,A Powerful set of moralistic tales of The Old West,"Out of North Dakota, where the frontier is still a fact of life, rides a storyteller who follows the trail of his neighbor, Louis L'Amour, bringing us a baker's dozen tales of western life without a miss-fire in the bunch. Kent Kamron has explored the hills and plains of the American West and knows well the men who settled there. The cavalryman, cowboy, mail-order bride, homesteader, Sioux warrior and schoolmarm, along with many other characters, inhabit this collection and bring the West to life."
1,stupid,"This book is so lame, I cannot believe it got such good reviews. I've learned very little from it and I find the author uses a condescending tone. I am recently diagnosed, but not ignorant. Other times, she gets so complex, that I find myself skipping those parts. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you know absolutely nothing about this disease. By the way, I do not profess to know everything, because I don't by any means."
1,Return of the Lucasfilm Garbage,"I've never seen a filmmaker do so much to ruin his own legacy as the ""great"" George Lucas.By refusing to give us fans at least a decent-quality copy of the original film with this release, he's slapping us in the face once more.It's pretty ironic that the man who came up with all these primo video and audio and special effects standards (THX, ILM) can't even issue an anamorphic widescreen version of the original Star Wars trilogy.Lucas, you should be ashamed that you're the first director in history that's gone out of his way to make a DVD look BAD!"
2,Great !,The game contidition is great and it was recieved earlier than expected which is awesome. This is not the first game i've ordered here and certainly won't be the last!
2,Preston Sturgis,I have only recently been turned onto Preston Sturgis & his movies & think that this collection is OUTSTANDING.
2,Good for the price,Good cover that worked well to protect my Ipod. Pretty easy to apply. Sticks well for a long period of time.
2,A rich chocolate confection for the soul.,"I was mesmerized by the writing, able to only read a few pages at a time, before my heart was so full I couldn't read more, every line was memorable. a real treasure."
2,Whats with the price HIKE!,Its sad to see the price HIKE on Superpump 250. Superpump Max is a little cheaper but I dont like it. I tried the same flavor ( Blue Ras) and did not taste the same as the 250 and did dot anything for me.It also looked almost pinkish instead of blue. The flavors are not even close in taste...Booo! for raising the price I will no longer be using it also unless the price goes down to what it was before.
2,Great Little Knife,"As with the other Globals I own, this knife always puts a smile on my face when I use it. It's real handy for the little chopping and trimming jobs.I own a variety of knives -- Henckels, Wusthof, Forschner -- and know how to keep them very sharp, but the first time I used a Global it was like stepping into a new level of sharpness and control. Whatever they're doing differently in the design and manufacturing of these knives, it's right."
1,re-issue,".This Maxi-CD contains a few versions of ""You're My Love (My Life)"" from her first album ""Love Is The Name Of The Game"" (1986).This album was produced by Gerd Rochel (BERNHARD BRINK, DANUTA, INGRID PETERS, JUERGEN DREWS, The LORDS, OHIO EXPRESS, PATTY RYAN, The TREMELOES, WENCKE MYHRE).Also, don't forget her second album ""Top Of The Line"" (also produced by GERD ROCHEL).."
2,IT'S ABOUT TIME,"I was at Universal City CityWalk and saw the video on the big screen. Everyone I was with stopped and looked in amazement. Her voice is not overpolished but natural, the music is real music. I am tired of hearing the same old sampled music all the time. Finally we have a real artist not someone who the record company used a big budget to sell an image. I really look forward to her CD release, I'TS A BUY!!!..."
2,Great Product!!!,"My 6yo daughter wanted a fountain for her birthday party. I researched different products and found this one was the best for the money. I used simi-sweet chocolate chips and it worked perfectly. The kids dipped marshmellows, strawberries, bananas, pretzels and animal cookies. The adults found this a hit more then the kids did. The set up and clean up was eazy, the motor is not noisy and the flow of the chocolate worked the way it was supposed to once I got it leveled. I am so glad I bought this product."
2,works perfectly,"I just bought this and although I don't do poached or soft boiled eggs, the hard boiled eggs come out perfectly! I am glad I bought this!"
1,There are better games out there,"We bought this game along with the leapster for our daughter last year at Christmas when she was 3 1/2...She loves Dora and she really tried with this game, but the only thing she would really play was the rabbit jumping on the letters and after awhile it would get too hard for her. I certainly don't think they made this game easy enough or enjoyable enough. If your child really likes Dora and Diego, I would suggest the Diego game. Not only is it eaiser to understand, the graphics are better and it's a lot more fun. My daughter has played the Diego game more in the few weeks we've had it than she has with this game."
1,st. corporate,"bands don't attack their fans for downloading their music, therapy sessions, coporate icons, same songs."
2,Awesome movie,this is a pretty good movie. Bradley Cooper does an extremley good job at his role. this movie is really good. the actors and the story are awesome. one of the best movies i've seen this year. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
1,*YAWN*,"This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. Each scene is so slow. The storyline is cliche and predictible. I knew exactly what would happen next with each scene, and how it would end. Theres also nothing scary in this movie. The parts that are suposed to be scary just have a little girl slowly walking around with cheesey camera effects and then she'll stab or strangle someone. Most of this movie is just dull empty hallways, and a bunch of little girls staring at each other and talking in monotone voices. To sum it all up this movie absolutely sucks, and if it scares you, your a pansey."
1,Steel 4.5mm Screwdriver Security Bit Open SNES,Item shorter than the screwdriver in the picture. Started to strip screws on my SNES. Stopped as soon as that happened and now I have to find another screwdriver to replace this product. Got what I paid for. :( Lesson learned and moving on.
2,Best hot sauce ever!!,"The best hot sauce you will ever find. I live in Ft Worth Texas, and I always have my father ship me this hot sauce whenever I need it(he lives in San Jose) Now that I can buy it online, I never run out!!! Its a bit expensive here on amazon, but if you look around, you can buy it directly from the manufacturer. You will have to buy it by the case though (12- 10oz bottles) but its well worth it if you use it as much as I do."
1,Contrary to popular belief...,"This album was NOT a tribute to actress Barbara Hershey, who got collagen-inflated lips for her role in the chick-flick of all chick-flicks, ""Beaches."""
2,recommended,"This lip balm is a little tough putting on sometimes, but it stays on my lips and keeps them moisturized for hours. Other lip balms I've used either left a funky taste on my lips or were kind of watery, and this one is guilty of neither. I plan to hand a bunch of these out as part of a Christmas goodie bag."
2,Gripping And Timely Medical Thriller,"This timely thriller of medical scandal and suspense is written by one New York City's most accomplished trauma surgeons. Dr. Michael Madden's penetrating examination of America's pharmaceutical establishment will have you holding your breath till the very last page.The story is well written and the pace respectful of the fact that I, as a lay person, was entering behind the scenes of the medical and pharmaceutical industry. I found this book fascinating, informative and highly provocative.This novel is a great read! I recommend it to anyone who loves good medical suspense stories."
2,Happy we were able to get in a narrow size.,We have ordered a pair of these shoes from Amazon three times before and have been happy with their durability. This time we were able to get these in a narrow fit which have been perfect for our tall yet very thin daughter. Again we feel this was a great buy.
1,"If you buy this, you are testing your luck","I already return this. It is nightmare to get this piece of stuff work. There have been a bunch of people online waiting for help desperately. And the official haven't given a solution for them.I am sure there are portion of people can get it works without any problem (see the other reviews), so I am saying that you are playing the dice.my os is Vista."
2,Brings out emotion in what Jesus did for us.,"I am by no means a wacky born-again Christian or anything like that; I know I sin: I swear, make fun of people sometimes, get angry, drink too much, eat like a glutton, lie, etc. Honestly, I used to idolize my favorite football team more than I did Jesus. This movie helped trigger a conversation that helped re-inforce my belief in Jesus Christ as our savior. It helped to make me realize that I can admit I am a sinner and that I need to be saved by Jesus to enter into heaven someday. I think this movie helped put emotion behind the story of Jesus. Hopefully it helps others believe more strongly in Jesus. Watch it and see. You never know how it might make you feel. Even if there's only a slight chance that Jesus really did go through this torture for us, it would help to try to believe, just in case! Hell for eternity would be awful. I want to go to heaven. It is also pretty graphic and edge of your seat."
2,"This will do you right, son.","The aforementioned work by said ensemble can have a profound effect on one's prophecy. Jazz is not dead. Backstabber's Ball is most refreshing. 'Tis swung. 'Tis conceptual. 'Tis sinister. Above all, this album is sincere by some of the H ippest musicians in NYC, the carolinas, and the world. I highly recommend this album for all who love that which the world calls jazz. Check out the melodies. Discover the harmony. Listen to Neal Caine and Jason Marsalis. Hear Stephen Riley and Ned Goold. 'Tis a ball For Sho."
2,A Book You Must Read,The book was so awsome that i couldnt put the book down after the first page.It was interested in how Mitch and Morrie got along so well. Mitch the former studuent of morrie would go to vist Morrie on tuesdays because they were tuesday people. I think it's pretty cool how they would talk for hours about real life solutions. I found Morrie interested in he wasnt affraid to die and had no regrets. Mitch on the other hand didnt understand life as much as Morrie did. It was upsetting when Morrie found out he had Als also know as Lou Gehirg disease. The best part of the book was it didnt matter how far his disease progreesed becuase they still meet on every tuesday to talk about things in life. I would suggest this book to people who love to read books about people. I could not beleive how Mitch didnt cry till the end of the book. I guess it up to the you to read the book to found out what happens toMorrie.
1,His worst effort (?) in years,"I've got all his albums and this is by far the worst dribble I've ever heard! I'm so disappointed in this I can't stand it. This is as bad as Flaming Pie was good. Mr. McCartney, if this is the best you can do at this point in your career, give up, go back to the farm, and don't keep teasing us with you on again/off again attempts at producing consistantly ""good"" albums. Honestly, there's not one good song on the album."
1,Too thin,Ugh! I took a chance despite some negative reviews. It's OK. It is definitely thicker than regular paper but I've bought nicer cardstock at big box store. Won't buy this brand again.
1,Need help with series soundtrack,"I thought this CD contained the soundtrack for each weekly series. I have been trying to find out the name of the song that was played every week on their series. It begins with ""I am the sun, I am the moon....could you tell me that and then i could purchase the CD that has that song. i was upset i spent money on something i didn't care for."
1,Danger.....,"Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
1,Whisper was not proper name for this pump,"After setting up this pump, I could hear it all over the house. The output was great and the price was too. I replaced the Whisper with another brand(Fusion) and kept the Whisper as a backup."
1,wrinkles paper,"These brother products wrinkle paper. Here is what you can do to confirm,go to the staples, press go three times.The paper comes out as a test page...wrinkled!Tech support says that 24lb hammermil will fix the problem. It does not.The paper handling is the weak link here.- D"
2,Good fun,"We ended our weekly poker session with these hilarious cards the other night. The captions are too funny. We couldn't stop laughing... or arguing.Half the cards are pro-Bush and anti-Kerry, the other half are pro-Kerry and anti-Bush. There are two copies of the major candidates and party personalities; one complimentary and one less flattering. Cleverly done. ""National Insecurity Adviser"" Rice and ""Control-Al-Delete"" Gore are my favorites.I'm sure these will make more appearances at the table."
1,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"I really like cappuccino so I was a little disappointed in the flavor of these cappuccino pods. They are not bad but I feel they could be better. I got this brand because they were cheaper than other brands. I think I will try the more expensive ones just to compare. But in reality, I probably won't purchase these again."
1,Zip 100's cause printer problems,"I followed all the Iomega instructions to a tee and I lost the ability to use my printer. Evidently the Zip drive has somehow confused my PC so now, even though I've disconnected the Zip, I still can't print. Zip or Amazon needs to warn buyers of this. Please send me some help! I am mad as hell that ""this wonderful product"" has taken away my printer. Can anyone help?"
2,I'm Having Success!,"Eight Minutes in the Morning is full of smart advice on how to get control of emotional eating and live life in a healthier way. The excercise portion is easy to follow. It takes very little time, but you will feel the results. The food program is also easy to understand and follow. This book is very helpful for real people with busy lives that want to get fit, be truly happy and live a good life!"
2,Good Camera for a Business Traveler,"I bought the Fujifilm Finepix A500 as a camera to pack in my PC case on business travel. I use it mainly to get candid snapshots in business meetings and conferences. It is small, discrete, and works well for the purpose intended. The 5MP resolution allows me to get quick shots without much care for composition, background clutter, etc. since I use a photo editor to take care of those tasks later-on. When buying this camera note that it does not have a case or much on-board storage. An XD memory card and a case are necessary. I also recommend getting a NiMH battery charger to keep battery replacement costs low."
1,Absolute disaster,Product arrived as a congealed mass. Not a single truffle survived intact during shipping...unmitigated disaster! Don't waste your time and money!The Lindt bar chocolate that I ordered separately arrived at the same time but in pristine condition.
1,Terrible movie,"We rented this movie for Halloween based on all of the great reviews and It will go down on one of the worst movies I've ever seen. We actually thought it was a spoof movie, which it kind of is, but still made no sense at all to us. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,"Our own origins, seen through the keyhole of the Declaration","I love the sheer surprise this books brings. It holds a mirror up to US, the contemporaries, madly trying to make myths and theme parks of our own heritage. Maier starts off by touring us right past the physical document of the Declaration, holy of holies, on display like an icon guarded by witch-priests in uniforms. She has no sympathy for this attitude of reverence; in fact, you feel that she might have a good belly laugh over the whole enshrinement, if she weren't feeling so disgusted by it.What's truly interesting is the tour this author takes us on of just where the Declaration came from. Tracing similar words and phrases and whole passages to state and local declarations of the time, she shows us the whole climate of belief the famous framers of the Declaration were working in. This book is really fascinating, I think: a great and surprising portrait of who we really were.And of what we have become"
1,"Pathetic. Simply Duke propaganda, nothing more.","Coach K gives away no ""secrets, but a lot of platitudes. The knowledge dispensed is already known to any student of the game. In short, unless you are a rabid Duke fan, there is absolutely no point in buying this overpriced restatement of the obvious. Save your money for another item."
2,One of my favourite books,"It is simply fantastic. Fosnes Hansen has a unique gift: We live these musicians lives, and make us feel like we have lost old friens when they die. I also loved his newest book (not yet translated, but you really should buy it if you liked this one!!!)"
2,book,"great book! My mom bought it for me when I found out I had cancer. It was very healing and also empowering. I have gotten this book for several people since, even doctors. Anyone can get something worthwhile out of it."
2,Excellent overview of standard spoken Chinese,"This is an excellent overview of standard spoken Chinese. The book does include a chapter on the written language as well. This is a scholarly book, not to be skimmed through quickly. Good bibiliography and index."
1,Very poor training advice,"After all the hype i have read about this book my expectations were, unfortunately, high. The numbered paragraph structure of the book makes it almost impossible to read and i had made little if any progress after using the program for 2 years. Most of the ideas in the book just didn't work."
2,Tummy health,Tummy is happier did take a bit to work but tummy didn't get in this shape overnight. Will buy again. :)
2,A funny movie!,"HoodWinked is about someone stealing all the goodies and the suspects are,little red rideing hood,the wolf,granny,woodsman.If you love fairy tales and action you should go see this."
2,Fun learning Webpage design,"I found this book really really easy to read.It teaches you all the basics of HTML, XHTML, & CSS using fun & easy-to-follow tutorials. This book places emphasis on writing code based on the W3C standards, so its very likely that the webpages you create will be compatible with all the current browsers.I'm a fan of the HeadFirst series for its simple, fun & innovative use of visuals so I highly recommend this text.CSS - The Missing Manual is next."
2,Great to have available on CD finally,I saw these guys play in 1972 or 1973 opening for John Mayall. I had never heard of them and became a life long fan. Great live act. I have had my vinyl copies since then and given many cassettes to friends hoping to get them on the D&G band wagon. While these are must have items for Delbert McClinton fans they have a broader appeal and are worthy of a place in your collection.
2,Should come in handy,This guild would be excellent if it had better and more illustrations. The descriptions and location info seems really good. I have ordered the “Sibley” guide for western birds to fill in the missing color illustrations.
2,Great way to wrap up the trilogy!,"I loved Christopher Nolan's entire Dark Knight Trilogy, and found this to be a worthy follow-up to The Dark Knight. Granted, no superhero movie will probably ever touch The Dark Knight. But DKR is a fun watch and I loved the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt :)"
2,A MUST HAVE,"This is a wonderful, wonderful resource to own. After reading this book if you don't write a novel you have no one to blame but yourself. Author goes step by step through the writing process. The book is full of encouragement. The chapters are easy to read and understand. Most of all this book is extremely PRACTICAL. I recommend it highly."
2,Intergalactic Dentistry brought right to your bookshelf...,"A simple dentist is just doing his job when he ends up operating on an alien. He impresses the aliens so much that he is kidnapped to train dentists on the aliens' home world. This book is excellent, and indeed an interesting journey for imaginative minds. One of Anthony's best single books in print."
2,Interesting Story of Mental Illness,I enjoyed this book. I liked the way that the story was told in different perspectives. It was interesting to see how the main character's mental illness affected her brother and parents. I would recommend this book to anyone!
2,book,This is a great book and mu favorite author. i receive this use copy hard cover in great condition..pages smell a little like its been in realy old book store but thats ok..still love
1,9 of 12 towels frayed 1 to 6 inches on first washing! Rating=0,"Towels were washed before using, 4 of each of the 3 sizes. On 3 towels of each size, there was a serious fraying on one side of each towel, most about 1 inch long, but one a full 6 inches! Instead of cloth, there are only strings! I could not believe it. They look worse than my inexpensive towels which have been washed scores of times over 5 or more years. I hope to be able to return them. They are nearly worthless. I am not known for having high quality towels, but I would not let guests even see them. Rating should be zero."
1,this is not a game,the graphics are fairly decent but its not long at all I finished in a week and I think the hole story line is messed up the action is poor too.Do reaserch before you buy the game and make sure its what you want.
1,too expensive & short rolls of film make this a bad choice,The printer and these cartridges are for suckers and that's how I feel after printing over 500 cards with this crummy printer. The cartridges rarely give me the 50 printed cards they promise and my last order had one cartridge that gave me fewer than 30 prints before it was ended.There are better bargains for this equipment with a much lower cost per card than this one.
1,Full Auto Conversion for the AK-47,"It has been (8) weeks and I still don't have my book. This company took my money but never sent the book. They don't give you a tracking number and just tell you it was sent out. Just go to their web site, which is closed down, (I wonder why?). I would never buy from them again, nor do I recommend you buy from them either!"
1,Not so easy for beginners,"I expected more. The yarn is fun, pretty & soft; the beads are a neat accent; but it was very difficult for my 9 year old niece to do. She wanted to learn how to crochet, but this was not a good way to start. The description said, ""an easy-to-do craft for beginners,"" but I thought it was more appropriate for those who already know how to crochet. The type of yarn that is provided is really what makes it so tough. My niece wasn't able to see her stitches, let alone count them, and she got frustrated with it and gave up (& she's not one to give up easily)."
1,Not satisfied.,"Not in as good of shape like stated. Really yellowed!!! Looked 30 years old or more. Would have returned it, but it would have cost me more money."
2,any guess as to when...?,"oops, i'm not writing a review just wondered if you have any idea when this book would be available. i check back every so often to find same msg. also wanted to grab this opportunity to tell you how pleased i am to do business with amazon. you guys are running your site right. congratulations."
2,Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things,"""Cradle to Cradle"" provides a glimpse into the future that sparks creative thought in a new direction - our future. This is a must read book that opens one's mind to creative resolutions to our current way of life; one that uses irreplaceable resources."
1,Terrible transfer to DVD,"As much as I love and admire El Greco, I don't prefer movies with elongated men and women in every scene. I am giving this one star because the transfer to DVD is so awful. It is really distracting to watch as everything is narrowed and elongated. The result is that it looks as if what you are seeing as been stretched and turned slightly to the side so that nothing is realistically proportioned. I could only watch about fifteen minutes of the movie before having to turn it off. I am sure it is a wonderful movie with great acting, but I won't be able to tell until I watch the VHS version, I suppose."
1,Nuvi GPS Carrying Case,"This carrying case is just fine for the GPS but only protects it and not the other things you have to support the GPS. Would have been nice to get a GPS bag that carries the cords, etc. As I said before, this works okay."
2,Training Day,"I am on an Ian Rankin kick. And this one is pretty good. Rebus is off to training in this one and comes across cold cases that he is able to help solve. Clarke is kind of on her own while he's away, but they eventually come together with their excellent one-two punch. Enjoyed it. Not my favorite by this author, but I enjoyed it."
2,Best Television For the Money,Excellent Picture with all ammenities that anyone would want on a Flat Screen. Except ordering a Television from Amazon is a long processes from order time to actual delivery.
2,Great trash can,"This is the best trash can, and the touch-top lid is very convenient (I have a slightly different model that I bought at Target). I also had the problem with the metal springs; mine popped off occasionally and one eventually got lost in the trash. After reading the previous two reviews I decided to contact Sterilite and, sure enough, they are sending replacement springs! I had been looking everywhere to see if they were available without buying a new trash can and was so pleased to find out that the company will replace them for you."
1,Not Impressed.,"This product, while being nice on your skin, didn't have a srong or long-lasting fragrance as I would like."
2,"Wana Learn JavaScript, Buy This Book",I am very impressed with this book. I think the author did a great job on it. His secure site idea is a great one and helps to keep myself updated with the JS technology. I have cut and pasted lots of his code from the CD (the CD has over 100s of code as the author promises). The book does not talk about other technologies and explain JS syntax and examples in a very easy to understand manner. A must buy!!!
2,You can't go wrong,.... with a Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Great story. Sheesh. the review has to be a certain amount of words? Read MORE!
2,very sweet,"Tulku Urgyen was a fine example of a true yogi.His devotion to his teachers shines through in these pages, and there's more to be learned here than just the verbal info.I highly recomend keeping this book around."
1,A disgrace to heavy metal music.,"I'm sorry...is this heavy metal? I don't think so. If these guys do heavy metal, then Yanni does gangsta rap. Fred Durst's ego is much bigger than his music, a facade which cannot hide otherwise repetitive and silly lyrics. How these guys made it #1 on the music charts, I will never know. It's always those number one hit singles...like Nookie. If that song (or any thereof) had meaning, I wouldn't be so negative. But trying to make an intellectual statement out of them is like turning a Dr. Seuss book into a rocket science manual. A good little dose of Slipknot should wash away the stench of Bizkit from all infected parties."
2,Very Good Indeed,"This is a very good soundtrack. The use of piano for Celtic music is not ""celtic band-like"", but the accompanyment by James Galway on whistles and flutes makes it fly!"
1,Not Close to HD But a Good Story,I purchased the Blue Ray treatment of this classic as a requested gift. If you already own this on DVD save your money because the HD treatment is VERY poor. Comparing my 5+ years old DVD version which has been watched at least 5 times with the 'NEW' BlueRay treatment I have to say neither offers a better picture -- and the improved picture is what I thought I was chasing.Two stars because it is the Godfather. Rating the upgrade alone I would give it one star.
1,An overly scholastic look at an interesting document,The concept of this book was admirable and the text of the encyclical is intriguing but a lot of the narrative is dull and repetitive. Its a good piece of information that could have been presented in a more readable manner.
2,Finally no more blown taillight converters,After blowing the non-serviceable tailight converter in my 99 4Runner I put in an aftermarket(not going to pay Toyota $250 for a new harness). Then the aftermarket converter couldn't take my camper lighting and I blew that too. So I researched and installed this Hoppy unit. It runs all of my trailer lights like a charm. My camper has 11 tailight/marker lights that are nice and bright now. Very pleased.
1,very small tab,The music in the book is not very appealing and the tab is so small you need binoculars to read it.
1,Buyer Beware! Do Not Buy Used...Game Will Not Work,Do not buy used. Due to the product activation/anti-piracy methods you will not be able to play this game if you are not the first person to register with steam. The CD key is tied to the account. So when you register and put in the CD key it will say that it is a duplicate product. It will not work!I repeat do not buy used.
1,The author talks too much,"I had read only 5 chapters and didn't tolerate it anymore. The author talks too much.. each 10 lines he wrote anything about his life. I had gotten nervous. Buy it by a humour book, dont a programming book."
1,"It isn't that she copied, but that she copied so much!","It's not the fact that she copied material from other people that is getting her into trouble,rather that she copied so much. Walter Rae fails to tell us how much is allowed before we must reject the material. If even the smallest amount is not permissiable, then we would have to be rid of the Gospel of Luke, along with Matthew and Mark. How much is too much brother Walter?"
2,More relevant than ever,"I picked this one out when my Dad took me to a paperback book swap when I was about 12 or 13. I loved it for the science and the way it was constructed, never realizing that it was a respected work that would be reprinted in the future. This is mostly because it does become somewhat ""goofy"" toward the end, but it is necessary to the plot.Every few years the title pops into my head as I watch or read news, so I'm off to buy and enjoy it again. Great fun for any fan of negative utopias and those disturbed by the seemingly random and imprudent recombinant gene experiments so popular for profit motives today."
2,not the item pictured,"great beginner board, although the one i recieved is not the red ""retro "" style as shown.(which is also the one i wanted when i ordered). The board i recieved was a blue standard shape tri-fin. so check on this if you are set on a specific style. Still a great deal for an entry level board."
1,Don't Torture Youself,This is by far and away the worst Triple Crown book ever. I don't know how a book can be published with words like open being mispelled. The book was double spaced which I really don't understand and I found that truly distracting. From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid. Please don't waste 15 dollars and I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library. This is the worst Triple Crown book ever.
1,no results,"Did not really help with my dark circles. Not that bad as a regular eye cream, but no visible results on my dark circles even after I used the entire tube."
1,Harvest Moon: save the homeland,"The game runs clunky and I swear it runs at only 40 frames a second. Last time I played a game that gave me a headache and caused nausea after 2 or 3 hrs. I discovered it was runnnig at 40 fps. I even timed the in-game day clock and it runs twice as fast as two psp harvest moons I am currently playing (harvest moon boy and girl and harvest moon hero of leaf valley, now those I recommmed whole heartedly - awesome:)). I recommed that whatever you do, do not waste your money on this title. It would be a serous purchase mistake. Thank you and good gaming:)"
1,Absolutely apalling,"Amazon's review policy won't let me reveal ""crucial plot elements"" so I can't go in-depth into all the awful things about this book. I will say, however, that after reading this book I had to go burn it in my kitchen sink. Not in a censorship kind of way, more like a spiritually cleansing kind of way. I know some of the older romance novels often included a rape scene as a convenient way to explain why a character lost her virtue (and therefore could continue to sleep with the hero) but the rape in this book (which does not come at the hands of the pirate) is beyond belief. The fact that the main character is content to stay and fall in love with the man who rapes her goes against all my feminist sensibilites. This book is a gigantic waste of time. Read it at your own risk."
1,gets worse and worse,"The first time I bought J-14 was in 2010. From there to now it has gotten from good to horrible! Seriously the stories are very shallow, they focus on crushes and celebrities . They are boring and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,LEAKY PERCOLATOR,"I just bought this percolator after my Melita one quit on me....2 days out of the box and the bottom is already leaking--yes the coffee is excellent, piping hot, however it is leaking a slow leak onto my kitchen counter top. I'm taking it back and trying another brand. Disappointed."
2,Fun to use,I purchased this for our Christmas tree layout which my six year old son enjoys running. He has a lot of fun using the Freight Platform. It's built well and should last for many a Christmas.
1,Avoid this LeapFrog,"I usually love Leap Frog - but beware...Our register may have been a ""lemon"" but it just didn't work...The coins kept getting stuck and we would have to shake them to get them loose...This happened constantly...It really frustrated my children...There is nowhere to store the ""swipe"" cards, so they easily get lost...Although my children seemed to enjoy the toy, getting it to work and having the accessories easily attached would have made this toy a winner...Taking the time to improve this toy prior to making it available to the public should have been a priority for this otherwise reliable company..."
2,Great value,"This clamp is great! It's much bigger than I expected, I purchased it for jewelry making. My only complaint is that it came in a really beat up Amazon box and it was COVERED in grease. Annoying to clean up, but works great. Apply a little goo gone and some elbow grease and you're set. A great value for the price."
2,Good beginning or backup reference,"I never feel safe having just one book around when I'm learning something . . . the broad coverage and low price convinced me to buy this as my ""backup"" to the main book I intended to learn from, but I ended up dumping the other one and using this one almost exclusively! The section on JavaBeans and JDBC, in particular, were very helpful, and much clearer than in other books I've tried."
1,Too much fluff,"The authors waste too much time on COM/MTS/Threading Models/ATL about which many books have already been written (many from WROX itself). It lists Alex Homer as one of the authors but i doubt he wrote anything for this book. (I was expecting excellent treatment of the subject more along the lines of ""Professional MTS and MSMQ Programming with VB and ASP"" by Alex Homer). The book could have been less than half its current size (and probably cost less) had the authors concentrated solely on ASP and Components for ASP."
2,Great Value,I am giving this 5 starts because on average the subscription is about 10 dollars cheaper on amazon. The codes is delivered immediately and works perfectly. I dont see how the transaction could be smoother or the deal could be any better.
2,Gran reprresentacion de esta bella opera,"Esta version de 'Manon Lescaut' es sencillamente fantastica. La puesta en escena de GOTZ FRIEDERICH es visualmente muy atractiva, y teatralmente presenta momentos de gran interes dramatico. KIRI TE KANAWA es una protagonista de alto nivel, que consigue una gran version del rol pese a algunas pequeñas tiranteces en el acto III. PLACIDO DOMINGO es un Dex Grieux sencillamente perfecto, tanto en lo vocal como en lo escenico. largo duo de Manon y Des Grieux en el acto final esta resuelto de forma antologica por los dos interpretes. El amplisimo elenco de cantantes secundarios rinde a gran nivel, al igual que la orquesta y el coro del Covent Garden, todos bajo la direccion de un muy inspirado GIUSEPPE SINOPPOLI. En resumen, no duden en comprar esta extraordinaria version de esta bellisima opera."
2,Easy to digest (sorry!) and helped my riding a lot,"Ryan's writing is clear and effective. I had some of the basic concepts, but reading her book really clarified how to eat before, during, and after long bike rides. Since reading her book I've set a number of PRs for long rides, due in large part to changing my pre-ride and recovery eating habits. I strongly recommend this book to any endurance athlete who wants to feel better while running or cycling. It's the next-best thing to seeing a nutritionist in person (which I also recommend)."
2,AWESOME RUSH CONCERT,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR RUSH TO MAKE A LIVE CONCERT DVD,FINALLY AFTER WATCHING RUSH IN RIO,I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.GEDDY ALEX AND NEIL WERE RIGHT ON KEY, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN I EVER HEARD THEM BEFORE.I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CROUD OF 60,000 PEOPLE THAT WERE SO MUCH INTO THE MUSIC AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS FOCUSED ON THE BAND.IN MY OPINION RUSH IS SIMPLY AWESOME,GEDDY'S VOICE WAS BETTER THAN EVER,HIS BASS RUNS WERE FLAWLESS,ALEX'S SPACEY GUITAR RIFFS WERE FANTASTIC AND I COULD FEEL THE POWER OF NEIL'S DRUMS WITH EVERY BEAT.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUSH IN RIO.... JTF"
2,It does work!,"Not sure if these guys with the negative reviews even tried this, but all I know is that it DID help on my phone. I have a an LG 420G, admittedly an older phone with older technology, and which, much to my dismay when I got it, got no reception whatsoever in my house and at work. I tried it in many locations and at different times. Now, THAT is a product that rightfully got very negative reviews for its reception, as I found out. But, I put one booster on and immediately got some reception at home and at work. I put two on, and now I get very good reception at home and at work. So, my experience is that these do work, at least with some phones, and it wasn't just my belief that it would work. I did do quite a bit of research on this, and I don't see where these boosters are any different from using the paperclip on the antenna of the orginal types of cellphones. At these low prices, you certainly can afford to try it!"
1,Don't waste your money...,"If you tire of cookie cutter computer manipulated rock, then don't buy this album. It is a waste of money...These guys need to get some originality. There is no creativity here at all and they should find a new direction to their music. No doubts that they have talent, but they don't know how to use it."
2,Innovative!,"It's my first remote extender. And I love it!This innovative extender is a great idea!The easy of use is very impressive, nice, precise and comfortable: you don't needto point to any target to control your devices.It supplies all my needs of a remote in controlling my blu-ray located inside a cabinet.I can command it from all the rooms in my house.So, I recommended it!"
1,"A good effort, but alas unsuccessful",I tried to listen to this CD several times and I found myself falling asleep. To say that it is boring is an understatement. I don't know if it is the voice or the guitar but I could not keep my eyes open.My only reccomendation is it is great for insomnia.
1,very disappointed,"I love kong toys. I have three german shepherds and bought three large footballs. The first day all of the covering was torn off of one of them. The second day, the second cover was half gone and the actual ball was split. The third is still squeaking but the cover is almost off. They LOVE the toys, but do not let them out of your sight for a minute because they are easily devoured."
1,Disappointed in HP product,"The product did not work constantly in my HP Laserjet 2420. When powering up the printer sometimes jobs will print and sometimes nothing. The Error code 49XXXX would show up periodically when printing was not working. Web Jetadmin was not able to fix or trouble shoot the problem. The USB port acts similar to the Jetdirect card, they both work intermittently. The problem is either with the printer or the Jetdirect card. The Jetdirect card is the first HP product that has not worked well. I will definitely look at other manufacturers products when purchasing a new printer. The Jetdirect card is still in the printer and when time permits again, another attempt to fix the product will be attempted. Until the problem is fixed, the printer works fine when the parallel port is used."
1,Not Waerloo tool box,"Ordered this tool box for grandson's machining course because instructor specifically recommended the Waterloo 16"" tool box. The box we received did not have the Waterloo logo, instead having a Martin Tool sticker at the lower right corner. Sticker said Made in USA, but the box it came in (which did have the Waterloo logo on it), indicated produced in China. Checked with Waterloo Industries and all of their products have their logo. Returning item; already ordered from another source (unfortunately having to pay additional for quick shipping). Disappointed as order lots of items from Amazon and have seldom encountered problems."
1,the features sound great don't they?,"for about a year and a half, and all of the sudden, it just stopped working...and caused all kinds of problems...I did everything I could to get it up and running, and nothing...The hardware simply broke. That's the only explanation for this.If you want something you can enjoy and not have constant problems with...and if you want something that will at least last 2 years, find something else...and make sure it isn't a Pinnacle product...save yourself while you still can. ""Tech Support"" is non-existent. I have called and NOT ONCE have I actually spoken to a real person...not to mention, it's not Toll Free, and hold times are AT LEAST an hour. Find something else, i'm sure there are better products on the market...i'm looking as I write this."
2,fun with fab!,"as a new-to-prefab lay researcher, i loved this book. a friend passed it on to me after we were all chatting about building our ""dream houses.""it gives a basic survey of different types of prefab, from modest to elaborate, and creative diversions in between. i found it an inspirational starting point to daydreaming about fun prefab modern living. the source lists are helpful as well. enjoy!"
2,Wonderful movie with a womans perspective,"Without telling you what the movie is about, you can read the other reviews for that, I thought it was beautifully filmed, written and played out. A wonderful movie with strong female leads and female stories. My husband and I were both surprised and impressed with the movie and will watch it again."
1,"why, why, why, why, why?","Why muck with a classic of one medium, try to force it into another, and then make matters worse by telling us what happened after the fadeout when a key reason CASABLANCA is so popular is that we all have our own ideas of what happened later."
1,Can't Do It!,"Now I can forgive another MC for sounding like another MC. Sometimes cats voices are just similar. But I can't forgive GB for using the exact same cadence as Biggie. Same pauses, flow, mannerisms, clothes, and everything. I refuse to buy it on that alone. First Shine, and now GB. When is it gonna stop? Let the brutha rest in peace!"
2,A profoundly gentle book.,"Dan Joseph has written a beautifully easy to read book about inner healing that is completely non-threatening in it's approach. The examples for dealing with one's feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. are well thought out and have truly worked for me. The over-all impression I came away with is here's a man that truly cares about helping people find inner peace."
2,A Sandbox To Make Ideas Play For Communicating,"Need a boost to make a weak creative idea to spring and communicate? Here you find phrases collected and offered according to logical and emotional paths: you start from a clue you'd like to express and, through these pages, you find your own way to have your say, while you make a professional communication item. A very good companion for ""Words That Sell""."
2,Very pleased with this heater,"I love this heater. It is perfect for a bedroom because it is very quiet. Once I got the heat setting I liked, I just made a mark on the dial since there is no numbered thermostat. My only complaint: the price! The day I saw this online it was selling for $59.99. The next day when I placed my order, it was $99.99! I see that it is back down to $59.99. I was shocked. Other than that, it is a great heater."
1,Disgusting Music.,"I borrowed Speakerboxxx from a friend after hearing they won grammy's and all that MTV hype. After around half hour of listening this, I reflected upon the sad state of the music industry. If albums that are this bad are winning grammy's, there is no hope for hip hop or rap. Severely over hyped and talentless. Limp Bizkit is great rap. Not this crap."
2,Hip Hop In A Class Of Its Own,"I am not much of a fan of hip hop in of itself. However, when I heard a few samples I thought I would give this one a try. After wearing this CD into the ground and ""The Standard"" I am ready for another release. Psyche Origami is a solid blend of hip hop and electronica (with a little house and acid jazz mix). It keeps a solid beat but has some very soothing sounds that you would expect from artists like Fat Jon. Kudos to Adult Swim for publicizing Psyche Origami."
1,"Been There, Done That","If you have the first Groban CD, don't bother getting this one. They are indistinguishable. The man has a beautiful voice, now all he needs is someone who can choose his music."
2,The best racing game so far,"I like this game so much because, it lets you use NOS or Nitro.When you get farther in the game you can use NOS three times!Also when you get farther in the game you can get motorsycles! With a motorsycle you can do a weelie!It also has the car from ""The Fast and the Furious"" With the engine showing in the front. If you don't have this game I wouldrecomend it."
2,Smells so good,"I think people either like scents or they don't, so I can't convince you to like this. I personally like it a lot; it is fresh yet manly. I will say that I was ecstatic to find this product offered on amazon so that I could buy it as a gift for my husband. He used to always wear it when we were dating but then his bottle ran out. Now, he wears it again and when he does I always say to him, ""You smell like my boyfriend..."" ; ) ; )"
1,IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...,"DON'T BE FOOLED. It's a $20 laser level, and it works like a $20 laser level. Don't waste your money, it's just not even remotley accurate"
1,Not worth the money,"I am very disappointed in this cookbook. If you are looking for a cookbook that has innovative, interesting recipes for food that people with diabetes can eat, save your money and don't buy this cookbook. A number of the recipes require either a food processor or a blender. Many recipes require extensive prep time. The author's idea of dessert is to eat a piece of fruit."
1,infamous red tint,Received the huey pro and tried calibrating about 5 times in different environments. Red tint evertime. Returned it. This was all tried on a dell precision laptop running vista
1,not satisified,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. I listen to clark Howard as often as I can so I was very disappointed by this book. If you listen to the show and consider yourself relatively frugal anyways, you probably will not learn anything from this book. A lot of it seems like common sense to me."
2,fantastic product,I had this item in the past and got this one for my friends dog..they love it...does a wonderful job..normally their dog doesn't like to get brushed but seems to enjoy it now...highly recommend
2,Deception,"Welllllllll....churck folks are a mess! This book was witty, snappy and the scene in the funeral parlor was funnnnnny! Churck Folks is a comical book on how church folk acts. Sad but true. I don't see how they could play with God like that because I'd be too scared that he will strike me down or something. It's a fun book to read. I look forward to a sequel because that's what church folk are -- a Big Messy Sequel!"
2,a Stranger's Heart,Absolutely wonderful movie. Am very happy with the speed that I received this DVD. Will definitely order from this business again.
1,Drivel,"Metaphors as soft as the marshmallows, this book is so cringe-worthy that I feel EMBARASSED for poor old Richard. The man described is an egotistical narcissist lacking in emotional maturity or the ability to see outside of his own reality. I am in love, very much in love, and I have all my life believed I would find my soul mate, but this book makes me embarrassed to have ever been associated with such an idea! He has obviously given hope to thousands of lost and lonely souls, however, who are now probably wandering around starry eyed and bumping into telephone poles looking for ""that perfect someone"". Well this is childish, I know, and I can't believe I'm going to say it but ... GET A LIFE, and broaden your horizons! :o)"
1,Save your money,"If you have a garbage can in your house, you do not need a diaper genie. I received it as a gift, so I stuck with it for a few months....having to buy the refills. Basically, my son was breast fed with multiple stools a day. Breast fed baby's stool does not smell bad enough that it has to be isolated. And even if my baby was formula fed...though their stools have a more potent smell, they don't have nearly as many per day. I haven't used it for months and he's 9months old."
1,Come on now...,"I read through this book in the store and did find it to have some good info, but the other review in here goes way overboard. It seems like this person is talking about the bible and not this book. The review states this book is ""a must-read"", ""an invaluable learning tool, as well as a must-keep guide for future reference"", ""an inspiring (yet mindful of pitfalls) strategy-packed book"", and ""leaves you wondering why he revealed all his secrets. ""Listen, if this is the author or some friend of theirs making this review, please don't insult our intelligence by making such a blatantly false review. This book may have some merit, but it's not the best thing since sliced bread."
2,A Practical Coffee Table Book,"The size and photogenic quality of 'Bouchon' indicates that the authors meant for it to be a coffe table book for foodies...similar to Keller's 'The French Laundry' cook book. But, the technical instruction in the book is excellent, and I've actually found myself cooking offshoots of several of the recipes from the book. The size of the book makes it a bit cumbersome to drag into the kitchen, but I typically take notes for my ""offshoot"" and bring the notes to the kitchen instead.If you have a French Bistro foodie in your life, this book would make a much appreciated gift."
1,Broke after 1 month,"Worked fine for 4-5 weeks, then completely stopped working. It turned on, could change radio stations, could play cd, only problem is only a slight hum would come out of the speakers, nothing else. RCA said send it back for a new one. Can't wait to see how long the new one lasts."
1,"Album is ""burned"" CD-ROM without liner notes","If you purchase this item ""new"" from Amazon, look carefully to see if it's listed as ""manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" The CD itself will be a greenish ""burned"" CD-ROM, not a standard factory-made CD. The burned CD-ROM bears only a generic ""Naxos"" label on it without any identifying album name! And worst of all, there are NO liner notes - none of the excellent scholarly Naxos liner notes that I have come to expect when purchasing their other classical albums. Caveat emptor!"
2,Great stuff,"This spray is amazing. I have been using it for years and it brings my voice back into vocal health every time. Finally a alcohol free 100% homeopathic spray. Just a warning though, it does not taste fantastic, but it will heal your throat. The ingredients thin mucous on the vocal chords and protect it from further damage from over singing, coughing, etc. Really love this stuff."
1,please buy better Birkenstocks,"I have been wearing Birkenstock sandals for fourteen years, and have loved every pair that I have purchased. Except these, which I will be returning immediately. I don't know what the upper portion of the sandals are made of, but it is not leather or suede, or anything that would last as long as I expect my Birkenstocks to last. If these shoes cost $25 or $30 I could maybe live with this man-made material, but not for $65 or more per pair. Please read carefully before you purchase your next pair of Birkenstock sandals, and make sure that they have leather uppers."
2,plane insanity....,"An interesting read from a flight attendant's perspective of his 16 years on the job. Some parts will make you laugh out loud, but when I picked it up from the library the other day, having never seen the book before, I didn't expect it to be insanely funny (despite the praise on the back cover), but more a FA writing about his experiences. A look from the inside, if you will. And that's what I feel it delivered. It was interesting and well written with the right amount of humor."
1,blah,"I didn't purchase this album but I borrowed it from my dad out of curiosity. I must say that James Blunt is one of those types of artists that seems to have it all....(ie cool voice, emotional lyrics etc) however his ability to write a catchy song (save You're Beautiful) is simply void. Someone in this list of reviewers compared him to Elton John. LOL....That's a good one. This disk isn't horrible. But it's not particularly inspiring either. Nothing on the disk motivates me to listen a 2nd or 3rd time.By the way, we were unfortunate enough to get the CD with the f-word explicative in the song, You're Beautiful, which blared out with our 3 kids listening in the car. Thanks alot, James."
1,Not Exactly an Encyclopedia,"The book was OK, some good ideas, some very elaborate ones. I think the scale was too extreme. It's not an encyclopedia by any means, wrong word to have in the title. Good book to flip through in the bookstore, not sure you need to own it."
2,enjoyable reading,I am not finished but wanted to let fellow readers know that this book is an enjoyable read.
1,Works ok,"It works fine if you limit what you cook on it. Can be difficult to clean and only works well on flat hard surfaces. Tends to tip over or rock. You can have mine, it's sitting out back not being used since I went back to using a charcol portable grill."
1,Disappointing - was this written by the same Stephenson?,"I read most of the book, but only because i was hoping that it would get better. No such luck. The couple of chapters dealing with the development of natural philosophy (which i liked) just aren't able to save this book from being, well... boring. After about 700 pages of dead wood, the book just crawls to a stop. If you like long-winded, pointless dialogues, disconnected plot twists and repetitive pseudo-philosophical rants, you may like this book. Otherwise, save your time and money and stay away."
2,Beating up a buddy never felt so good,"Great boxing game. I don't think I'll ever get enough of the slo-mo knockout replays. The graphics are incredible. The controls are smooth and easy. I only give 5 stars to the greatest games but anything 4 stars and up is definitely worth buying. Play with a friend and it's much more enjoyable although the single player mode is plenty enough to make it a good investment. Being able to pick and challenge legends like Ali and De La Hoya is tasty icing on the cake. (Where's George Foreman?)Improvements should be made on the commentaries though as they tend to cut off in the middle before and after instant replays. That and I think my coach in the corner has given me the exact same lines after every round for the past ten fights. Other than that, great game."
1,Worked but....,"I am a woman that RV's a lot and had trouble getting a good grip on my cord and pulling it off the electrical box. So I thought this was going to be the best solution. I cut the plug off my electrical cord, and easily installed this one. Works great but....now with the handle attached, the plug won't fit out the electrical cord exit hole on my coach. So I have to leave the access door open, and get rain and snow inside the electrical compartment, which is ruining the lining inside. I should of bought an adapter with a handle on it..."
2,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!,"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS BOOK A NEGATIVE REVIEW! Yes it is written by a person who has done prision time, but it is not a nonfiction book...IT'S FICTION!!!! And yes, it was lightly based on the authors life. But again, it is fiction.There was not a boring chapter in this book! It holds you and never lets go until the very ending...I read 200 or more books a year, and I can HONESTLY say this is the best book I have ever read."
1,One Star is TOO much,"I gave this book one star because zero wasn't available.Anne Rice has always been marvelous at drawing mental pictures for me as I read her books. This one drew mental blanks.Actually, the story line is very good. The ghost, the history, the intertwining stories of the Russian prince and the New Orleans Socialite were intriguing. But the excess of words! Rice's flowery writing has always caused her stories to soar. In this one, the prose was a boat anchor. For a while, I reread every paragraph trying to figure out what she had said, but finally gave up. I had to force myself to finish it."
2,My kids cannot stop playing this!,"My kids and all of their friends absolutely love this game. The songs are current and the judges are quite realistic - for example, if you mess up the end of a song, they respond with that type of comment - they love it when you're good, tell you that you're horrible when you are, etc.Better than Karaoke Revolution.It's school vacation week and my younger 9 year old daughter and 3 friends have been playing it for hours.We brought it to our ski house and 10 kids played it in competition with eachother. Then the adults got hold of it and loved it too."
2,"Fun, like other Crash Games...","I recently obtained Crash 1. I already had Crash 2, Crash Team Racing(CTR), Crash Bash, and Wrath of Cortex (PS2). I began playing the game, and noticed only one negative thing. You cannot save the game unless you are in one of the special bonus levels (which you can get to only if you collect three of the little cards with the bear on them- I do not know what those are called.). Other than that, the game is challenging and fun. Most gamers should enjoy it, whether they are hard-core gamers or not."
1,Absolutely the Worst!,"I was, and I emphasize the word was, a big fan of Patricia Cornwell until this book came along. I bought the audio version of this book on Ebay and am at least grateful that the full price wasn't paid. This book is absolutely the worst book I have ever read (listened to). I kept holding out hope that somehow this book would get better (or perhaps less stupid), but it never happened. I felt like a prisoner in my own car as I listened to this horrible, horrible, horrible book. I couldn't wait to get rid of this book."
1,"Good, but........","I am a beginner soap maker and found this book to be extremely informative. There is a great amount of information regarding the different types of oils and additives you can use. But, being a beginnger, I found the recipes waaay to intimidating and extremely large. I almost got turned off of soap making thinking that I would need a scale to measure lye to tenths of grams! (i.e. lye weight 567 7/10 gm) Also her recipes call for you to make batches of at least 40 bars each, an amount I was not interested in making. There is a lot of good information in this book, but I think that this book is for people extremely serious about soap making."
2,Works great - no issues.,Works great - no issues. Would prefer to pay a little more and have no headaches.
1,Nope.,"King on a bad day is better than most writers on a great day. So I cut this book some slack. But, I am forced to compare it to his previous novels (as the reviewer below states, he has some BRILLIANT work in his portfolio.) This doesn't come close to touching the horror, and the captivating page-turning qualities of his earlier work. I LOVE King, and hold my collection of his earliest work (Carrie) right through to 1990 or so (around Misery time) as absolutely SACRED. But I honestly haven't been moved by anything he's written in close to ten years now. Bag of Bones has a ghost and an evil character -- but they seem to lack the malevolence of his past evil characters. And the plot, while interesting at times, seems to just kind of chug along -- rehashing snippets of themes from other novels, with nothing particularly earth-shattering. The crossword puzzle thing was kind of neat, but even that seemed like a tired gimmick in a book from an author who's well finished from his prime."
1,"still great acting, writing still needs work","That I continue to watch this show is a testament to the great actors on this show, Laura Linney and Oliver Platt leading the bunch. Very talented people. I gotta say, though, the writers are still coming up far short of what this show could, and should, be, with such a great cast assembled. Shame."
1,"Smells heavenly, but left me dry and itchy","This soap gets one star for the awesome herbal smell. Another star is for the amount of suds the bar produces, with just a couple of swipes. However, after one use my skin was left so itchy that I finally had to get undressed and smother my skin with lotion from head to toe! My facial skin was so tight that I could see every wrinkle! Even when applying the soap in the shower it burned my facial skin (but not body) and my face was left reddened for hours after application. I do have acne-prone sensitive skin, and think this bar would be more beneficial to normal or oily skin types. I wish the soap would have worked for me, too."
1,Terribly Annoying,"I thought ""what you waiting for"" was an incredibly fun and catchy song, so i thought i might like gwen...then come her other ""hit songs""...hollaback girl is effin annoying, as is rich girl, and everything else that comes out of her mouth.What happened to only good singers getting famous? voice doesnt even matter anymore"
2,DBZ Budokai 2 is da bomb!!!!,"Dragonball Z budokai2 is awesome. They have way better moves, fusions, potara, and characters. You can now get Majin Buu Super Buu and Kid Buu. It is AWESOME game and u should get it!"
2,"Just as awesome, but less savory scent...","This is fine shaving creme, and I had to try it based on an ongoing Wodehouse obsession, but other scents are better than Eton College. Sandalwood is the cheapest (usually) and best smelling (to me). Get this for fun, but for your first creme get TOBS Sandalwood."
2,The Family That Preys,This was Tyler Perry's best movie. Kathy Bates and Alfrey Woodard were great !!
1,Suitable for only the simplest designs,"If you want to design and build a box with a simple A-frame roof, then this tool is for you. For any modern design with multiple roof lines, gable walls, bonus rooms, etc. it just doesn't work. Also, the window library is not very good and there are no way to build your own windows, i.e. put an eliptical transom over a window, etc."
1,"Great car wax, doesn't remove squat","Claims to remove tar, bugs, sap; maybe if the stuff is still very fresh. The Turtle Wax did absolutely nothing, but give a great wax shine to the bug splatter and pine sap. A cheap bottle of nail polish remover instantly removed all the crud, and cost allot less. The nail polish remover did not hurt the car finish or clear coat. The only reason I gave it a two was even though it didn't work, I love the spray on, wax off shine it gives."
2,Instant Undergound Classic!,This album is Great. If you haen't heard it the do your self a favor and stoppin sleepin! It has some of the illest beats you'll ever hear and 3 of the greatest lyricists you'll ever hear bringin ill lyrics to every track.
2,Excellent deal for multi-region,"Two minutes after plugging it in I was watching my region 2 DVDs. The price is great, but I haven't explored any other features yet. I bought it ONLY because I have region 2 DVDs and can't play them anywhere. If this only gives me this functionality, I'll be thrilled. If I get more out of this machine, I'll be THRILLED!"
1,I would give this book a zero if possible.,"This book is proof that universities hate their students and only want their money. Boyce needs to take notes from Rogawski on how to write a comprehensible math text/solutions manual. I hope Boyce reads these reviews and realizes how big of a bag he is, but he's probably to busy polishing his only turd and repackaging it so he can continue to exploit students for drug money."
2,This band is amazing,I had their CD before they were signed they are amazing. They are now only a three piece but they sound even better. They remind me of the Verve or U2
2,Classic 60's social-political comedy,"I listened to Tom Lehrer as a kid in the 60's, and memorized most of the songs, but to hear it again is very fun. Also, the songs still resonate - even though the names and issues have changed, the humor is still quite fresh - my wife, who's never heard this stuff, laughs out loud through the whole collection."
2,It will be a starter on your kitchen team!,"I'm not sure how we got along without a pan like this for so many years. While billed as a lasagna pan, and it is indeed great for that, it can also be used as a small roaster pan, or any number of other uses. Just the right size, and cleans up easily! Appears to be solidly constructed and we expect to use it for a long time. One suggestion to Cuisinart: It, like any pan, would be enhanced by a plastic cover which could snap on and make leftover storage a breeze!"
2,Awesome - highly recommended,These speakers are absolutly great. I trashed my Klipsch ProMedia 5.1 Ultra's for these instead of repairing them. So glad I did!Highly recommended.
2,Little Guardians is a page turner to not be missed!,"I will first admit that I am not a steady reader of any books but this story will captivate you and draw you in and soon you'll see the pages turn and the beautiful, magical story unfold. I was able to envision each scene as the author captivates with so much indepth description, you almost feel as if you're there in Fay Surety's adventures. The love and comraderie as the two different worlds of Guardian Meadow and Guardien Park fill your heart with pride and makes you long to be part of such a loving, giving and supportive family. If you liked ""Harry Potter"" and his friends, you will definitely find as much love, excitement and mystical adventure to fulfill your dreams with the Little Guardians!!!!!!!"
1,Dated and no great revelations,No great discoveries here. Wethern tells about how much the Hells Angels partied and used drugs in the 70's and the beginning of methamphetamine distribution. The book drags and bogs down. I recommend Under and Alone instead of this book.
1,Daniel,"This movie has great content. The authors had a great idea on relating the movie content to todays problems. However, poor animation doesn't appeal to modern sofisticated kids (my kids are not going to watch it again). The animator have used dark gloomy colors. There is almost no motion in the scenes. The content also is best suitable to older kids (> 8 years old or older). On the other hand, adults may like it."
2,Good natural flavor,"Peanuts are not sweet unless sugar is added. This is good peanut butter, it does not separate and tasted like fresh roasted nuts. I have had peanuts straight from the field and oven roasted them, this is just as good. The slight sweetness from the molasses makes it my all time favorite. The bad part is the cost."
1,WHAT THE *&^*?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I just bought this cd and popped it in my cd player, first song sounded familiar. I continued, next sounded familiar and the next one and the next one, what the hell?! I just got ripped for 13 of my hard earned dollars! im getting my f&%*ing money back. BE WARNED! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!Frukwan your as dead to me as poetic! YEAH I SAID IT!"
2,Zune Charger,The zune charger that I ordered works great!!!! The process was easy and it was delivered in a timely matter. Thanks!!!!
2,Don't turn away for even a second!,"This series plays with the depth of an engrossing novel, with a very realistic visual execution. The series relies on character development and a plot that is so unpredictable that you simply can't turn away for even a second. What's amazing is that it manages to do all of this without the crutch of music or any fancy special effects.A word of caution though: you must start at the beginning of the series or you will never pick up the story.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
2,Eric's still going strong!,Loved every song on the CD! I remember Eric Martin from years back; he's one of the Bay Area's best! I'd recommend this CD to everyone! It rocks!
2,Best Purchase I Have Made in A Long Time!,"I bought the 8 panel. My Cavapoo puppy is 7 pounds. This is perfect for her and would be fine for multiple puppies or a larger dog. I love how the panels easily seperate so I can get in and clean or make smaller, bigger. Plenty room for her crate, puppy pad, bowls, toys, etc. I don't know what I would do without this ! My puppy no longer needs to be locked in her crate if I'm gone for hours. Now she had her own little room which she loves!It is hard to lean over the top to reach in so I open one of the panels to step inside if I need to. I don't want to injure my back! I love that I can step in this way. The doggy door s great. Fast shipping, good quality, looks better than the usual metal pens, love it. Convenient , great buy!"
2,Love coffe and milk,"I can be a little hard in the beginning to close the Mukka,but once you'he got it, having a cappuccino every morning is a delicious."
2,very tasty,This is the best product i have see on the internet very yummmy If you like pork rines this case will last you for a while
1,Do you ever want to sleep again?,"I bought this after reading the label for ephedra and anything else I thought would be problematic. I had very few qualms--it's One A Day, after all! Talk about an established brand! After taking them for three days I had one whole night of sleeplessness! Although I've never been sensitive to caffeine before, I guess the amount of it in these vitamins is so high that I spent the most miserable night, just trying to get some sleep. I think consumers should be warned much more of that possible side effect. I threw mine away."
2,Timely Words of Wisdom,"We so need to rediscover personal meaning in our worklife, as well as our personal lives! What a great place to glean authentic principles that WORK - Viktor Frankl's heroic triumph of finding meaning after surviving a concentration camp. Pattakos presents Frankl's principles for meaning-making in a very readable and, more importantly, DO-able format! Bored with your life? Pick up this book! It will not fail to inspire!Rebecca Skeele, author of You Can Make It Heaven: How to Enrich Your Life with Abundance and Lovingwww.makeitheaven.com"
1,Where's all the Spanish Music?,"Are you guys kidding me? Half of the movie's soundtrack is missing! ""Mi Gente"" by Hector Lavoe, ""Che Che Cole"" by Willie Colon, ""Muneca"" by Eddie Palmieri, ""Vieja Luna"" by Celia Cruz & Johnny Pacheco, ""Abuelita"" by Willie Colon & Hector Lavoe, ""Alma con Alma"" by Ray Barretto & Adalberto Santiago, ""El Todopoderoso"" by Hector Lavoe and the best song of the whole freaking movie: ""Para los Rumberos"" by Tito Puente. What happened? Whose pockets were not lined, who wasn't paid off? This soundtrack offering is a joke! Get the Mambo Kings soundtrack, if you want good latin stuff. They are lucky I gave them 1 star. I couldn't give this less."
1,Waste of Talent,"Let me start off by saying, the film is NOT terrible...just bad.These rankings are out of 5Acting: 3 1/2Comedy: 4Gore: 5 (probably more if possible, just disgusting)Plot: 2Effects: 1 1/2Overall: 2 1/2If you enjoy watching a poorly made Irish-High-School version of Sean of The Dead, then this is the film for you!"
2,"Dr.Gero is back and wants to take ""its"" revenge against Goku","The DBZ Cell saga is finally going to be released on DVD in its original and uncut form. If you are a DBZ fan then you can't miss both the 2 Trunks DVDs as well as the 4 Androids DVDs. Each disc should contain 3 episodes just like the Ginyu ones did before. Unfortunately the Japanese audio track is going to be Mono only (unless Funimation gets better master tapes from TOEI before release) and the English audio track although being stereo doesn't come with the original audio Fx (well, I don't know about you but I hate when a studio replaces the original Fx with cheaper ones... At least you still have the chance to hear the original audio track on these discs). The video quality should only improve disc after disc and it was already quite good on the Ginyu discs. Let's hope Funimation is going to include the original eye-catch segments as well as the preview ones. Collect them all! The Cell saga is finally out on DVD !"
2,Yet another great Jump5 DVD...,"I just got this DVD about an hour ago, and it's great! There are two music videos (God Bless the USA and Spinnin' Around) and interviews with the members of Jump5. I love both the videos...they're both really cool and fun. God Bless the USA is probably my favorite of the two though, because it's such a pretty song and the video's just...awesome.The interviews are my favorite part though, because you get to see how normal they really are, and they seriously seem like people that you would hang out with every day. I highly recommend this DVD to any Jump5 fan that does not already have it. It's a great DVD, and I also recommend the ""All the Time in the World"" DVD."
1,too small,the book was very misleading.It was a way too small.Hated the size of it.I have a old one that is a lot bigger.
2,good compilation,"This book is well organized, and gives a lot of pratical exercises very usefull for those who works with the frail erderly, but i didn't found anything new in it. On that matter,i was a litle bit disapointed"
2,Original series,"Take Jurassic Park and turn it into a program about the development and life of the Dinosaur and you'll get an idea of the quality of this program. If you like the subject matter, then this is a must to watch, graphically superb with the history of the dinosaur to boot. The BBC at its best."
2,More historical than critical,"Pat Buchanan, an ardent supporter of solid, but cautious foreign policy, has written an excellent account of the policies of the United States overseas. In beginning this work, I had expected to hear a greater degree of persuasion throughout the book, championing Washington's Farewell Address. While this was referenced throughout, I encountered much more history than I was anticipating, but was pleased it was there, as it lent an importance to his argument for the present and the future. Buchanan weaved his way carefully through America's history, complete with discussions of the Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny, the great wars, and up to the very recent past. Anyone concerned about the future of America's military and its future, as I am being 22 years old, should read this masterful discussion, regardless of one's political affiliation."
2,"Boss CH5730 Chaos Series 5"" x 7"" 3-Way Speakers (Pair)",These speakers are nice i connected them the other day and made my system sound more clear and sound nice.
2,Liked It,The author gave loads of his own experience but it would have been nice to have more history and legend
2,Toshiba Looking Forward,"I hope to expand on the potential of this product at a later date, for now it has been GREAT. I have satellite and will expand on the setup to recieve the full potential as advertised by Toshiba.Fast shipping, well packaged, and good tracking info."
1,Good idea but the book doesn't deliver,"It seems the author took the e-mails she received from people and without editing them published them in the book . There are lots of errors and mistakes . Some seem to be so summurized they have totally lost their effect . Overall I was very disappointed in this book . I stopped reading it when I reached the last 20 pages and picked up a much better book called ""Toxic Inlaws"" I recommed Toxic Inlaws to anyone having inlaw problems like me ."
1,Beware,"The touchscreen is ""touchy"" and mine never worked right. Warranty is only 90 days. I recommend looking elsewhere!"
2,The best collection of worship songs ever put onto a CD...,"This has to be the best series of Worship music I have ever seen. Just an awesome assortment of songs sung by people/bands that want to give their all to God. I have this one and Wow Worship Blue, and I can't wait for Green! A MUST for every Christian home!"
1,Pulls my hair out,"I bought this haircut kit because of all the rave reviews, and the integrated vacuum. The latter works ok, even though the occasional hair goes through the screen and gets stuck. The biggest problem was that it doesnt cut well and actually pulls my hair out. My friend had bought one as well, and has the same problem."
2,Rocio Durcal..The Best keeps getting Better!!,"I have always admired Rocio Durcal for her amazing voice. Her last 5 productions have been have been terrific and what makes them so great is that each one is like a little different world. In this, her most recent production. Rocio demonstrates once again that she is the very best and the Ultimate Queen of Spanish music. My favorites from this album are ""Sombras Nada Mas"" of course, ""Caminito"", ""Nostalgias"", ""A media Luz"" and ""En esta tarde Gris"". I love this album, I have heard it 10 times today already and I still want more!! She has a harmonious voice, I am so proud to be her fan because she is truly the best, and the best thing is that she doesnt have to do a ""crossover"" like other artists to prove that she is the very best. I hope that she records many, many more albums in years and years to come"
1,SugarDispenser,"I bought this container for an easy way to hold a 5lb bag of sugar/ However, the lid doesn't fit tight. Very disappointed"
1,Disappointed,"My daughter had a bookmark similar to this in the past, but lost it. We purchased this so she can take her bookmark to dance class in order to track the minutes read in between classes, etc. When we received this product, it did not work. Tried to put the battery back in, etc. to no avail. Very disappointed that her gift didn't work when she tried it."
2,Air freshners,"This fragrance is light and lemony. I like it much better than the heavy floral scents of popular air freshners. Although the bottle is small, it lasts a very long time. I have used Fernwood products in the past and they are exceptionally fine."
1,good book if you don't care about logic,"The author claims conservative Christians make better fathers and husbands than mainline Christians and non-religious men. To support his claims he uses some statistical wizardry (really just hiding things). He finds in the process that conservative Christians are more likely to beat their wives and kids than are the others. Yet, in the end, he still claims conservative Christian men make better fathers and husbands. Right!"
2,joy,"Genre-defying, audible ecstasy that reveals the infinite possibilities of music when left unrestrained and open to the muses of geniuses.""Blackwater"" could be the most beautiful song ever performed.An enduring and unexpected exercise in creativity and belief in the magical powers of spontaneity."
2,Error!,"Otto Winter is not the actual organist!The real organist is MIKLOS SPANYI of Hungary.He made the recording in 1987 and sold it to a german record producer. That record producer sold Spanyi's recording to several labels. Such as Point, Madacy, etc.Some cds say Otto Winter at a Silbermann Organ.Inactuality it is Miklos Spanyi at the Calvary Chuch in Szombathely, Hungary. The organ was built by the Eule Orgelbou of Germany.Mr. Spanyi himself emailed this information to me.Otto Winter is not an organist at all."
1,Only because it's cute,"I received this kettle as a Christmas gift a couple years ago, and I was thrilled because I love cows. But in use, it's really not practical. The whistle never seemed to work right, and, like so many before me have already said, it pours unevenly. I scalded my foot with it. :(I only give it two stars because it's so darn cute."
1,Cute but sizing was wrong,The outfit that I received didn't come any where close to fitting per sizing information.I think that they put an XL tag on a L outfit.I was able to have my dog wear it by just using the neck connection and made it like a cape.
2,practical and insightful,"this book was recommended to me by several MDIV graduates as a basic primer on Biblical Interpretation. I found it very accessible, and found the principles easy to remember and teach to others (those in my small group, friends, etc.) I especially like how Fee & Stuart address particular interpretation issues specific to the Epistles, Old Testament, Prophecy, Wisdom books, and Gospels."
1,This sounds like demos and outtakes!,This really sounds uninspired. A turgid march for someone's funeral. If you want to hear a fantastic band with a far superior lead singer then check out Metric.
2,"Wow, my back feels AMAZING","I'm a 24 year old male who is fairly active. I run around three miles a day and eat a raw food diet (if you don't know about raw please do yourself a massive favor and google it...it's not raw meat).This yoga transformed my body (especially my back) and mind. I love meditation and even though I don't follow the mantras included in the DVD, I find that after the yoga my body and mind are very clear. This yoga is different than the other yoga that I had been doing (I'm a beginner) so I thought it was weird at first....but wow, the results are amazing. I also didn't think it was that great of a workout the first time I tried it...but I wasn't doing all the exercises correctly.The second time I gave it a try I asked a friend who's fairly experienced with yoga to join me. She ended up being worn out by the end and I realized what an intense workout this DVD actually provides.Check this great DVD out."
1,Don't buy it!,"The way this toy is presented is very misleading. For $47.99, I expected a much larger toy. I thought the car looked at least 10 to 12"" long. What I got was a 3 1/2 to 4"" long toy. Not much for almost $50.00! I will not buy these Hasbro toys again. They are way overpriced for what you get. Please understand, I will continue to do business with Amazon. Just won't order Hasbro toys."
2,Excellent condition,I received the item in excellent condition and sooner than expected. I would highly recommend this seller to everyone.
2,Useful training tool,"Heavier and more rigid than the tanto version but has the benefit of an integral hand guard. The paint cracks and peels quickly so it gets ugly fast. Other then that it's well made and lasts under heavy use. I've had a half dozen of these for training classes and they've held up perfectly for almost five years now. They bend but don't break, hit hard enough to tell you've been struck, but don't leave any lasting injury though they do have a tendency to leave welts with heavy impact where the lighter tanto-style knives do not. I strongly suggest avoiding head shots or wear appropriate protection. Great value-priced training tool."
2,Better then nothing,I got this for my crazy ferrets.. the box itself is great though they broke that plastic clip that holds it to the cage in 5 min. I ended up going and getting some nuts and bolts and have it nice and secure now
1,Rip Off!!!!!,I was ripped off!!! I was told that this item would be a full size helmet and instead I got a mini helmet. This is a pure rip off!!! This is what is called False Advertisement!!!!!!
1,CHEAPLY MADE JUNK,"Filmed at warhol's vacation home, or somebody's new york area estate---and that's about it for locale.I have this on a cheap double-feature disc; probably cost a dollar at the time, though maybe I paid five dollars through a previous amazon/ebay membership.Mostly talking; all boredom; the opening credits are superimposed over 1970s times square.Warhol is in this movie, but it isnt a Warhol movie; not as though the crew or director from olde 1960s or even early '70s Warhol daze.Warhol, in his published diary, said how Jack Palance took some movies so he could get drunk without any problems....Palance was definately one of very many Hollywood drunks.Palance is in this movie for maybe 40 minutes, Warhol for about ten minutes and mostly in the same room...otherwise a bunch of amateur nobodies in the cast.If you ever saw the bottom of the barrel 1970s horror movie DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT---it's as though they took that movie and added some cocaine refernces to it."
1,A great idea but....,"I loved the idea of having a rod AND sorter bags to transfer clean laundry from the dryer to the bedrooms. Unfortunately this product is not well made enough to do that. When I first put it together, it was a little wobbly but once I really tightened the screws it was OK. But now that I have been using it for 4 months or so it is loose again and tightening the screws has not helped. Also the wheels have a very hard time rolling on carpet or turning corners. When I try to lift the cart to get it over the bump between the tile and carpet, the wheels fall off and they are a pain to put back on especially with a full cart. The sorter is just one big piece but it would be much easier if each of the bags was easily removed so I could take laundry out of it without having to move the whole cart. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone. It is just not very easy to use."
2,Inexpensive / Simple to Use / Crystal Clear / FREE HDTV,"I just bought a [very] nice 40"" Samsung LCD HDTV and haven't coughed up the extra money to upgrade my DirecTV to the HD box, so I read up online about over the air HD antennas and thought I'd give it a try. I figured I'd start with the cheapest antenna I could find and if it didn't work I'd get the next one up.Well I just bought this Philips Indoor Antenna for $9.99 plugged it in (quick and simple), set it behind the TV and bang got perfect HD reception for my local ABC, FOX, CBS, several PBSs. I realized I didn't get NBC so I moved the arms a little bit and set it on the other side of tv and boom... got NBC HD as well. I was amazed... I sort of just sat back in awe for moment at the clarity. I never knew TV could look so good.I HIGHLY recommend trying this antenna before spending $40-$100 on some other one that probably won't work as well."
2,Led Zeppelin's Best Album Ever,"IV is the best Led Zeppelin album ever to come out. All of the songs are still played on classic-rock radio today, so discussing what one is the best is really pointless. You've got your pure-blood rockers (""Black Dog"", ""Rock & Roll"", ""Misty Mountain Hop""); cautionary anthems (""Stairway To Heaven"", ""When The Levee Breaks""); acoustic ballads (""The Battle Of Evermore"", ""Goin' To California""),and the unusual ""Four Sticks."" Some people like to listen to this one really loud, but its uniqueness can only be truly appreciated at a low-to-moderate volume."
2,LAMB IS SO PERCEPTIVE AND CLEVER.,"I picked up She's Come Undone from my 16 year old, who bought it because she liked the cover. Even though I thought that she was kind of young for some of the material, it was too late she had already read it. We both found it to be a book that you do not want to put down. Dolores Price is a character I will never forget. How can Wally Lamb understand this woman so well? He is so perceptive and clever. I saw his next book I Know This Much Is True and did not hesitate to buy it. He did not disappoint me. My daughter also read this one. As much as we liked the first, this one was entirely different but just as intriguing. There was a wealth of material but I would not complain because I feel like we got to know everything we needed to know about the Tempesta and Birdsey families. For a week, I missed reading it....like a good friend had left town. Mr. Lamb....you are a born writer.....Thanks so much for sharing your talent with the world. Keep on writing."
1,what the heck is this??,"This one goes on the shelf never to be heard again....what dance floor are they talking about......pass me the ""e""? Where is the Madonna that brought us Holiday, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself....I know the remixes will be EXCELLENT...until then, wait!"
2,Makes Breastfeeding Easy,"I have been pumping and storing my breast milk for my daughter for several months. When it was time for her to take the bottle, she took it was ease. It is also very convenient to store, freeze and feed her with the bottles and liners.It is the only bottles I use!"
2,Satisfactory Stocking Stuffer,These were a great stocking stuffer for my husband. We use these around the house for keeping our desks and TV areas looking nice. Arrived in time for Christmas.
1,She just needs her own style,"She has a beautiful voice, granted. She just needs her own style. She would be an awesome artist had she just sung with more individuality and boldness. Best of luck to her in the future though, she seems like a perfectly nice girl. Just not too rewarding a career with this dismal outlook."
1,have tiny toes?,"Although this is listed as a toenail clipper, it only works on my smaller toes. The cutting edges have an ""over bite"" and don't open very far. The cut is smooth but many small clips are needed to clip the big toe nail and middle toe nail. Clipper feels good in the hand and is powerful enough for the job but the jaws are too close together so nails don't fit in. The cutting edge is as narrow as most fingernail clippers."
2,ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING,"ART PEPPER HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER, DUKE JORDAN HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. JAZZ HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. IN LEAGUE WITH THE BEST LIVE RECORDINGS BY MILES, COLTRANE, ELLINGTON, MONK, MINGUS, COLEMAN, YOU NAME IT. PURE MAGIC. OVER 4 ALBUMS WORTH OF MUSIC SPREAD OVER TWO CDS. GREAT SOUND. I ALWAYS THOUGHT JAZZ DIED IN THE 60'S. HOW SILLY OF ME."
1,The Coming Storm,"First off, let me say I loved Sea of Tranquility. So Iapproached this new novel as a fan, excited to read it. But once intoit, I was instantly bogged down in prose that seems tired, at best. Every scrap of dialogue, line by line most of the time, is glued down with reflections, reactions, ruminations, memories, allusions, wispy sexual fantasies, subplots, or (sometimes even ""and"") snide rejoinders. It takes pages and pages of overwrought, adjective-laden prose just to get there. I am not one for Grisham-style speed. But I would like the plot, hackneyed and tired as it is, to move a little faster. After all, from the start, we know where this thing's going. Sure, you can get on the interstate and go somewhere you've been before. You can even take some of the turn-offs. But why do you have to examine every single blade of grass along a route well-traveled?"
1,More talk then scripting,"You open the book, start reading paragraphs, write a snippet of code, read another paragraph, write a block of code (that doesn't pertain to the snippet of code you just wrote) and repeat. The other author does not add and build on the previous code you wrote and doesn't build upwards. You don't gradually move upward in this book. It's all side-stepping and more reading then typing. I'm talking a page and half on a single line of code. The author sometimes confuses me by repeating a couple of words in the same sentence. Long, drawn-out, boring read, with minimal code, that doesn't get built up."
1,great graphics ridiculous puzzles,"After playing Riven and The Last Express, Beyond Atlantis was a sheer disappointment. Some of the puzzles were downright impossible and completely illogical. Granted Riven had some tough ones, but they were intergrated into the gameplay. In addition, the acting was embarassingly bad. I didn't even finish the game. The only motivation to complete the silly puzzles was to see the next ""cool"" scene. Bottom line, there are too many other games with beautiful graphics and engrossing plots as well. Steer clear of Atlantis!"
1,This optical splitter does not work.,"I have a HD Directv receiver and a Blu-Ray DVD player, both of which have digital optical outputs. Unfortunatley my surround sound receiver has only one input for the digital optical line. So, I looked on-line and found this splitter which has 2 input lines and 1 output line. This item claimed to automatically switch from one component to the other all by it self. Set-up was very easy, but unfortunaley it does not work, even when I turn off one of the components. No matter what I tried I could not get it to work. So I am back to manually plugging in the system I want to listen to, at least until I find a splitter that works, or upgrade to a surround sound processor that has 2 inputs."
2,A Family Standard,We have enjoyed many recipes from this cookbook. Most of the dishes are quick and easy. Our least favorites are the desserts and the tuna fish casserole. I purchased this copy to give to my daughter and her husband. It is a family tradition.
2,Evolutionary Dead End,"The survival of all organizations depends on how quickly information moves across them. Fast, you win; slow, you lose. Any organization, political or corporate, that cannot translate the constantly falling cost of information into higher information velocity, is doomed.This excellent work shows how Mao raised information costs for everyone but himself, and brought information velocity to a dead stop, effectively shutting the door to China's future. His methods were unspeakably brutal -- one Holocaust per quarter during the Great Leap Forward -- and his interest in those closest to him non existent.Editing: Four Stars. The copy needs a little bit of help. Some of the prose is a touch stilted.Copy Editing: Five Stars. Very clean."
2,The Genuine Article,This is the genuine Nokia product. Sturdy Scandinavian design. A green LED on the top to indicate power. The at&t store wanted a lot more for a charger that was not Nokia brand.
1,wrong product sent,A 25 ft cable was sent instead of a 50ft cable. When we asked for the correct item they said it was no longer aavailable for the listed price.
2,Very cute puzzles,"My daughter loves to do jigsaw puzzles and has no trouble doing puzzles with 25 pieces. These puzzles come in a little wooden box with lid and inside has four separate spots for the four separate puzzles. Each puzzle is stamped on back with a different shape so keeping them separate is a bit easier (at least for the parents). She likes them but I have to separate the puzzle pieces because she just don't have the patience to do so and sometimes when the lid is closed some puzzle pieces will move from one section to another. Overall, its a well made puzzle that should get many years of use (unless you have a dog who loves to chew on wooden things)."
1,Cute but not all that!,"Both of my 8 wk old shih tzu's can climb out of this. It's a very cute play pen but design wise it lacks. I think the horizontal bars are too close together for puppies to use as a ladder and climb out of it.Instead of using it as a playpen, I'll use 2 pieces to block the doorway or part of a room when needed and that works great!"
2,great mask,I ordered two mask they arrived three days early. Great quality I'm not sure of the filters but they are expired I expected to purchase new ones any way. Very easy to put on and adjust. The drinking straw is a little short but a neat extra. Seals tight no leeks in either. I also purchased two children size also just as good.
1,Not what I expected...,"I found the lack of interesting photographs and monotonous prose to take away from the lore and fascination of Cleveland cemeteries. There is a wealth of information that is not presented. Trivial facts about those residents whom the author finds interesting, may fail to interest others. I wasn't interested in a written, walking tour. The point of walking tours is to discover for yourself what you find interesting."
2,"Very comprehensive, but hard to read.","This book is very comprehensive. It covers over 870 species of fishes. The fishes are arranged in alphabetical order of their scientific names. In my opinion, this is not a very way to present the fishes. There is no organization at all. Who can memorize the scientific names? I would rather see all the tetras in one section, and all the cichlids in another. If you want a book mainly for fish identification, the mini-atlas or the full atlas may be better choices. Some of the photos are in poor quality. If you are a beginner, many other books may be more suitable."
1,CAULK MASTER AIR GUN,"I WAS HAVING FUN WITH, MY DAD I WORKED TOGATHER ON HOMES 25 YEARS. SO I GOT THIS IT WAS GOOD FOR 6 TUBS, I MADE SURE IT WAS CLEN, AIR PSI, WAS RIGHT. THEN IT STOP,, IGOT SAMS TUB OUT OF AIR GUN PUT IT IN A HAND GUN, TUB CAULK WAS WORKING GOOD. ALL TUBS OF CAULK I GOT AT LOWES AND LOOKED AT THE DATES ON EACH ONE. THIS BAD THING NOT BECOUSE IT STOP ON ME I READ ALL ABOUT IT WHAT WAS SAID HOW THAY USED IT. I HAVE $40.000.00 TOOLS, BUT THIS ONE GOT ME TDHILL."
2,worked great. Expiration date was not an issue. Completely satisfied,worked great. Expiration date was not an issue. Completely satisfied.Picture quality was similar to the Kodak product available locally instores.
2,Definitely recommended,I found this book incredibly informative. The research that obviously went into it is incredible. I always have the same problem with McCullough's books - they need an editor. About ten percent of this book was superfluous and just didn't fit. Still I enjoyed it greatly!
2,"Gunsmoke - The Second Season, Vol. 1",So glad this season is out on dvd as the guys in my household have been awaiting its release. Split volumes aren't an issue...just glad its available.
1,Pet Gear Tri-Fold Pet Ramp,"We ordered this as our dog is aging, as are we. We were lifting a 50# dog in and our of our Forester. A friend has a ramp for her pets and suggested we get one. There was no weight given for the ramp in its description. When it arrived it was so heavy that we could hardly lift it inside the front door. Since we need to carry it with us and use it at both ends of a trip, there is no way we can get the ramp in or out of the vehicle. It remains unopened sitting in our house while we decide what to do with it as it is not useful to us. We would not have ordered it if we had known how heavy it is."
2,"Unfortunately, much is true in this book","I know many of the individuals mentioned in the book and I'm sorry to say that while there are some exaggerations, I believe the OSU stuff is pretty accurate"
2,Interesting but not her best work,"I have read ALL of Alice Hoffman's books and was very excited when this one came out. I have to admit though, I am a little disappointed. I am about half-way through the book and finding it not a compelling read (I keep hoping I'll get hooked)HOWEVER, I would urge any reader - whether you are loving this book, or hating it - read her other work, ESPECIALLY ""TURTLE MOON"". That was my introduction to Hoffman and really blew me away. Don't give up on Alice, every book can't ""hit a home run""."
1,Diccionario de expresiones y términos de interés policial y criminalístico / Dictionary of terms and expressions of police and c,"Most of the terms included in this dictionary are common terms you could find in any dictionary. If you whittle down this dictionary to those terms that are relevant to what the tittle suggests, you would probably end up with and a few pages in your hand.It would have been beneficial to examine a few pages of the actual content before making the purchasing decision."
2,MP3 listening...,"I have used a few of the Trellian products, and this one is pretty good. The drag and drop feature and their customer friendly format made it easy to use. The price is right too. Trellian has a pretty good website boasting a few other services as well, so their not just another software company."
1,Not recommended,"""Hodge-podge"" is the first term that comes to mind after reading this book. The breadth of topics is notable, but the material itself is far from satisfactory as applied to the real world. If someone offers to pay you to read this book, it would be worth reading. Also, please note that several five-star reviews were written professionally for promotional purposes."
2,insane music for insane high on acid,CRAZED WARPED AND BIZZARE. THE GANDFATHER OF PUNKS BEST ALBUM EVER
1,journey arrival,"This album, the first without Steve Perry, was shocking to say the least. The songs lack the songwriting talent Journey fans have come to expect. As far as the new lead singer he does sound similar to Steve Perry but that should not have been the case. I feel Journey should of taken the band in a new direction not steal the sound which fans expect from Steve P. As a fan since 1982 this album will be put where it belongs on the garage sale table."
1,better than the girl bratz babyz,"See, I don't like Cameron at all, but at least he is wearing pants that cover up everything. But he is not fun at all. I played with him for about 1 day, then he sat under my bed for about a week and then my mother found it and gave it to the thrift store for some other girl to dwell over for about a day.The girls are much cutier, but over all, all the genders of bratz babyz are butt-ugly! Esp. since the girl's skirt barely covers up her butt. Yet again, I liked Camron more than I liked Cloe and both of them ended up at the thrift store after collecting dust under my bed."
1,No 3D effect at all,"I ordered this 3D Blu-Ray disc based on a couple of good reviews. I was excited to sit down with my kids to watch the new 3D under sea tour. Of course we all had on our Active 3D glasses. We've watched many other 3D movies on our setup and liked it very much (mostly kids movies like How To Train Your Dragon, and live concerts). This particular disc has no 3D effect at all. My Active 3D glasses (that automatically darken when they detect a 3D signal) didn't even darken. The screen looked exactly the same with or without the glasses on; normally the 3D screen looks terrible if you are not wearing the glasses. It's like the disc is labeled 3D but is actually just a regular Blu-Ray disc. Very disappointing. We watched about 20 minutes of it - it's an okay show if you want a 2D aquarium tour with some soothing music, but it is certainly not a stunning 3D under sea adventure. I am returning this item the day after receiving it. Very disappointed."
2,"as good as the movie, and better!","After Seeing the village i was desperate to get the score on CD. i found that for the first time, not every song had the same sound, and i was basically correct when i listened to the score on CD. it was an amazing score using violins and making sound a lot softer but much nicer then signs, i thought it sounded so stressful, like howard was trying to acheive a fear with his score for signs. but i was pleasently surprised (as with the movie) that it was his best score yet. the movie wasn't my favorite of his, but it is my favorite when it came to twists, because there were many.anyhow, this is a great CD"
1,The worst peice of trash ever,"This book is out of rint for one reason, it is terrible. I am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says. She blames P&G for the destruction of the environment, mistreating employees, the role of women in society and racism. P&G has done many things wrong, most big companies have, but it is not the cause of the fall of Western society."
1,Do not order from Perfumania,"Great product (I would have given 5 stars), but....I ordered the 3.4 oz perfume from Perfumania.com, got the confirmation email from Amazon that said I paid for a 3.4 oz bottle, but received a 1.7 oz instead (for the same price that I paid for the 3.4 oz). I contacted Perfumania by email same day to ask if they would give me a partial refund or have another 1.7 oz bottle sent; I never heard back from them. Is it that hard to click ""reply"" or to dial 10 numbers on a phone to please a customer? I will never do business with Perfumania again and have recommended everyone I know to never purchase from them. I am filing a dispute with my credit union as well; maybe that will get their attention. Worst shopping experience I've had with Amazon."
2,The best straightener ever!,This is the best hair straightener I have ever used. It heats up FAST and it straightens your hair fast. What can I say other than its the BEST!
1,Don't buy this,"I have had nothing but trouble with this product. It cannot distinguish between trays, therefor you must load and unload each time you switch from one type of paper to another. The carriage continuously locks up, requiring resets, and paper jams, usually damaging the photo paper. I would estimate that only 25-30% of the printing attempts are successful. When it does print, the rollers either scratch the emulsion on photo paper or it prints slightly askew. Eventhough I have bought extra photo cartridges, I am returning mine. I believe money is better spent elswhere"
1,Mac Users Avoid This Product!!!!,"I used this printer for quite some time with my Pismo running OS 9.2. When I purchased a Powerbook G4 running OS X, this printer was obsolete, i.e. no drivers available. Sony was absolutely not interested in making a driver for this printer and could not care less about the customer STUCK with this pathetic piece of equipment.If you are a mac user forget it. This printer is not worth a dime. If you already have one, find a PC user to sell it to. Shame on Sony for not working with Apple. If I could give it a rating lower than 1 I would."
1,Doesn't Work,"I thought the price was insanely good, would have been nice to know the Shipping & Handling was just as much. I plugged the car charger into my iPhone 3GS and the device said it couldn't use this accessory...NOW if I want to return the item I don't get my S&H back and there is an excessive restocking fee of 30%++"
2,Works,Being as I was raising my floor a good amount by adding hardibacker and tile I needed a long throat seal to fill the gap and these do the job. Plus sticks better then the wax so no problem with it falling off as installing toilet.
2,This is not what I expected,This is not what I expected at all. I love kaleidoscope quilts but this was not complete and it was not as pretty as I expected
1,Don't buy this product.,This was a waste of money. It leaked sugar water all over the deck and I couldn't even use it. I saw some of the reviews saying it leaked but I wanted to give it a try because I liked the balloon. I should have trusted the reviews. Don't buy this with plans of using it as a humming bird feeder - it leaks like crazy. I'm trying to find a way I can use this as a garden decoration. Very disappointing! Wish I could give it less than one star.
1,too long,"I would give this book 2.5 stars(why doesn't amazon offer the option of 1/2 star?)At the end of this book, it became more fast paced. But she could definitely have cut out a good 100 pages or more and it wouldn't have ruin the story. I decided to skim through page 250-400 or so, just reading the dialogue. I'm finding some of Sandra Brown's books to be long winded, while others are really good and the perfect length. Total hit or miss. Nothing out of the ordinary, this is just a typical murder mystery,other reviewers can go over the plot for you."
1,What is this stuff?,"Woah... From blistering hella good guitar rifts to this hardly rock, pop stuff--one can only ask: what where they thinking? There is really no song on this album where you get a feel for what the Scorpions are actually known and loved for: their heavy, driving beats and melodic harmonies. I am a HUGE Matthias Jabs fan, and I don't even hear one guitar solo on this album where he really gets to show his amazing talent. Where are all the guitars? Where's the rock? Where are the Scorpions?!"
1,The V551 Mortorola,"The telephone is a lemon plain & simple. It has so many problems you can not even imagine. If approached to buy this tele "" Run "". Cingular is a good Company, I give it a 5 star plus , they just need to take this telephone off the market."
1,I can't wait for this to go on sale used!,"Once the used DVDs hit the market, I'll start looking. I'll wait until it falls under a dollar, and get it then.Perhaps I'll get lucky and find it in the Wal-Mart discard bin, under a copy of ""Battlefield Earth"". Or maybe it will turn up in the local Salvation Army next to all the discarded Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter books.And then it'll go on my shelf right next to ""Santa Claus vs. The Martians"" and all my other really bad fiction."
2,Very Campy but lovable series,"I was around ten when I first saw Space 1999. I loved it, even though at the time I thought the level of technology being attributed to humanity by 1999 was a little far fetched. Even my young mind knew we were not going to be on the moon in any substantial form in 1999. I always thought it should have been Space 2029 or Space 2039. This would have made it a little more plausible to begin with. However with that said, it's a fun series. Who doesn't love the eagles, the moon base design, and the color-striped armbands? Admittedly, some of the stories, especially in the 2nd second pushed even a ten year olds limit of imagination. Who can forget the episode when crewmembers regress back and forth to cavemen, yet every time in their metamorphic jump, their clothes change! One moment their cavemen wearing furs, the next modern humans, but now wearing space suits. Silly, yes, but fun."
1,Lining came off first time used,"The very thin non-stick coating on the pot came off the first time I used it. I wrote the seller but got no response. I want a refund, but the product is not ""new"" anymore, and I tossed the box. My opinion is that the company ripped me off."
2,Kindle 1 Works Great - Nook/Kindles on AT&T Problems,I just subscribed to the NY Times Blog and by the time I went into the kitchen and opened by Kindle 1 the NY Times Lastest News was downloading. For the Kindle 2 users connecting via AT&T in weak or no direct AT&T connection: I had a Barnes & Noble Nook for a couple of weeks and finally returned it. I live in a rural area where AT&T does not provide service but relies on partner connection which eliminates use of 3G connection. I could not get the Nook to connect to my encypted router even with Barnes & Noble Techs having me try multiple solutions that did not work and only made me go over $$$ my cellphone minutes. If your not getting automatic updates check your reception at the time.
1,disappointed with this blender,"This blender was bought for chirstmas last year, and it fell apart on me.Actually, it's inner gear that is made ofplastic broke. to replace the part will cost me $20 for shipping and part. That is crazy.I did not keep my receipts due to it being a simple product. The last blender i had was an old green one from the 80's and that was the best. I did not have to replace it, just tha i wanted one new an more modern looking... This is not recommended."
1,Bought 3 and Returning (DOA & < 10' range),"One was DOA and would not turn on and we got an RMA on that one. I fiddled with the other two and set the sensitivity on high and the one unit would activate with me walking in front of it at around 10 ft (most of the time) and the other wouldn't activate until within 6-8 ft. I adjusted the sensetivity and nothing I did would get the units to sense motion of my 6' body more than 10 ft; the documentation says 25 feet and that ain't so.These units have very poor quality control... if any. It would have been very simple do duplicate my issue with the first one by putting 3 D cell batteries in it and turn the sensitivity to high and test it. Obviously, that was not done so I waste new D cell batteries and time dealing with customer support... it took 5 minutes to explain to them what was wrong with it. Now I have to explain what is wrong with the other two. Don't bother calling right now to leave a message at customer support because there message que is full!"
1,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I don't feel it's up to Adams' usual standard, nor as good as ""sniglets""--remember them? I don't like the idea of using existing words--usually proper nouns. More imagination was needed. And I didn't get the illustrations."
2,Good Buy! Easy to Install,I received the product in a timely manner and it was easy to install and made of durable materials.
1,Desperate attempt to milk the Lion King fame,"I loved the Lion King, and even enjoyed the second one. This however, totally destroys the first one. All it does is take the first movie and stick Timon and Pumbaa where they don't belong, along with throwing in some random things about Timon's family. There is one cute song in the beginning, but that is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie. You might as well watch the original, and if you want a new and interesting plot watch the second. Don't waste your time on this"
2,mh,"very helpfull cookbook for the person that is just learning to cook. But, most people just starting out love to have pictures of what they are supposed to be making. I loved Betty Crockers cooking basics, or if you want some variey -get both"
2,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this book about 2 months ago. I couldn't put it down. The bookstore in my town is just getting them in every 2 months or so. I'm still trying to get Infernal Sky. They shoulda wrote more.
1,Wow... Just Wow...,"I have two primary complaints:1. No serial killer would be this organized or complicated.2. An emo serial killer is the worst idea I've ever heard.I thought Dennis Quaid's acting was decent throughout and good in a few scenes. There are a few shots that are intriguing, particularly the first scene in the film. Other than that, the plot is like trying to swim through pudding and the ending was one of the least satisfying things I've ever seen.Seriously, skip this one.. it'll only make you mad and give you a headache."
2,THE ULTIMATE DANCEHALL RIDDIM!!!,"This riddim by far outdoes any dancehall riddim eva made. It came out couple years ago but is still one of the only dancehall riddim you can play in a club, whether it's hip hop or reggao and still gets the dancefloor jammin'. It's a must have for any dancehall fan. Top 3 tracks on the cd is da Killa's 'sufferra', ele's 'elephant message' and for some reason Wayne Marshall's 'overcome' made the list..but all the tracks on the riddim is tight regardless...again, this has got to be the best riddim eva made...can't be beat. Bless"
2,fantastic item,"This is a special bar to execute squats without worrying about getting the bar past your bent knees. It's especially useful for guys with long limbs, like myself, who would have to either bang up their knees or lean forward unsafely using a straight bar. It take Olympic sized weight plates. The product is extremely durable and easy to use. It came very securely packed. It may seem, looking at the picture and dimensions listed, like you're going to have a hard time fitting into the opening at the center but trust that it's well designed and will work as expected (unless you're unusually large of course). Do note that the bar is heavy itself and they don't say in the packaging how much it weighs. For those of you who like to know exactly how much you're lifting total this could be annoying, although I'm sure you can call them to find out the bar's weight."
2,Excellent camera,I have had the c-5060 for almost a year and am very happy with the camera. The wide-angle lens is great for landscape photos. I find that the amount of post-processing I need to do with photos from this camera is minimal. Sharpness is always good right off the camera. It also handles contrasty scenes very well and doesn't overexpose as much as other cameras I have owned.
2,Great replacement belt!,"This belt replaces one that was damaged when a zinc pot-metal motor sheave split and chewed it up in less than a minute of operation. With a new cast-iron sheave installed, this belt should last a long time."
1,Mundane Poison,Length:: 6:28 MinsHere's some general thoughts on this series. I ended up doing it in four parts but only one could be posted here.
1,Ordinary CD instead of SACD,"I'm not sure whose error it is, but I received ordinary audio CD instead of Hybrid Audio CD that I ordered."
1,Two of them have died mysterious deaths,"Completely unreliable product. The first one I got worked fine for about two weeks, then mysteriously ceased functioning entirely. You press the button, it whisks for a minute, but no frothing. They replaced it, and then the second one did the exact same thing except it died after two uses, not two weeks. Complete waste of time and effort if a product is going to be this unreliable."
1,Terrible and a waste of film,"I love zombie films and I thought this one would be along the lines of Special Dead and other low production value, but funny zombie films. It falls apart on every level. The acting is atrocious and worst of all, the story is not funny or inventive. This film feels like something someone invented while they were too lazy to actually think. Please do not waste your money on this garbage, it is not original, funny, scary or interesting."
1,The Great White Savior,"I decided to give Kingslover another chance after reading The Bean Trees. Unfortunately, Animal Dreams didn't improve my opinion of the author's storytelling. Like the Bean Trees, Animal Dreams seems to be obsessed with the Great White Mother rescuing the poor little red and brown folks out there. It's great that she has a liberal heart and think about political issues that deal with non-whites out there. However, it doesn't translate so nobly anymore. It's starting to sound like Upper Middle Class white Peace Corps volunteer club. Let's have more stories about people helping themselves, rather than a bunch of Halle's rescuing the ""natives"" from powers-that-be. Also, the theme of finding the perfect ""minority"" mate in both books are getting old. Please think of a new story."
2,Barbie Forever Tawny Horse,"If you want to give the WOW FACTOR to someone, give them this horse. The horse is great and my Grand-daughter was estatic when she saw it, but imagine her excitement when she realized the horse could really walk! Hours of fun, even without the Barbie that is available to ride Tawny. A must for any Barbie lover."
1,"Get Confused, Gauranteed.","Although the preparation material is decent, the sample practice tests are awful. I just took the verbal tests and more than one third of the questions were either low quality, unclear, or just plain wrong. More than half of the critical reasoning questions have arguably no correct answer or more than one correct answer. The explanations are just a few words more than ""Answer B is correct because I say so"". The author seems to be incapable of critical reasoning and logical analysis, let alone teaching you about them."
2,nerd porn,"If you like the original star wars and don't care for CGI ladened crap sandwich lucas fed us in the 90s and beyond, you should really get your grubby nerd mits on this. Listening to Carrie Fisher talk about ripping off her gaffer tape, and her suggestion to raffle ""ripping it off"" to the crew as prize, is forever burned into my imagination."
2,Brutal but Honest Portrayal,"This book does not pull any punches about prison life. Advice is freely given and some of it may be disturbing. For example, the authors clearly state that you WILL have to fight in order to survive behind bars. If for no reason other than to show others that you cannot be ""turned out"" or be made a victim. As an attorney who has toiled in the criminal justice system (both as a defense atty and as a prosecutor), I was moved by the book's honesty, compassion, and accounts of prison life. There are sections dealing with corrupt guards, gangs, drugs, sex, money, etc. Nothing is left out. This book should be required reading for all those who advocate ""tough on crime"" as this read clearly demostrates that prison is a brutal and unforgiving experience."
1,very dark period piece........,"The Girl, based on a Catherine Cookson novel, is a period drama set in Victorian times. While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.While in all probability more realistic to the times, Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the ""wrong"" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch. Be forewarned-this is not a ""family"" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a ""man trap"", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the ""heroine"" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.1.5 stars for the sets and costuming."
2,QUALITY!!!!!,"VERY QUICK DELIVERY, EXCELLENT QUALITY. WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER FROM YOUR COMPANY AGAIN. THANK YOU REALLY ENJOYED THE CDS.DJ GINO"
1,Lousy Beer -- Lousy System,"If you like horrible yeasty tasting beer, then buy this system. When you are done ""brewing"" your first batch. You will probably drink one and try to get some friends to drink the rest. You may even convince yourself that ""it wasn't bad."" After that, you won't want to drink the crap again. A few years later, you will pull it out from a dusty closet and ship it off to goodwill."
1,ZWHAT????,"Okay, sadly enough, grunge IS dead. Hell yeah, it was short lived, but it spawned some incredible bands and if the Smashing Pumpkins weren't a good enough alternative rock band for Billy Corgan to exist in, then i say let it go cause nothing will ever top their ultimate album: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The new stuff is similar given that the man's voice cannot be mistaken for anyone else, which is what made the pumpkins so unique and great, i think. Fans will like it for that, but the feel is different. I would've rather corgan to have never sang again without his true bandmates than this. Maybe i'm just bitter. Mayonnaise."
2,Super guidance for Parents of Pre Teens,This book came recommended from our Elementary school counselor. I thought the book had very pertinent information for a parent entering unchartered territory with a pre-teen child. The book offers detailed info for each year so you need to put it in a safe place and reference back each year as a refresher. I think I will read this book again and again!
1,"Disappointing, not crayons at all....","Well, I there had been other reviews when I ordered these. After such a long wait, only to find out they are not crayons. We didn't use ours yet, since reading the packaging made it clear they were just crayon ""shaped"" soap. On the soap front, I will probably return them as they are VERY fragrant, and my daughter is sensitive to perfumes."
1,eww.,"Crappy. First of all, it stings my eyes. Second, it comes off/ flakes during the day. It actually doesn't really lengthen. Very Disappointed. Oh yeah, it takes forever to wash off. bad coloring too, the serum doesn't dry clear so if you miss a spot with the black Step 2, you'll have weird white-tipped eyelashes. I dont recommend."
2,What Every American Should Know About Who's Really Running The World,"Melissa Rossi's book ""What Every American Should Know about Who's Really Running the World"" is exactly the kind of book I've been looking for. Through mainstream media it is difficult to get a clear perspective on the mechanics of global politics, corporate influence and the complicated issues that affect our world.Rossi's book offers a wealth of information on these subjects while remaining entertaining and readable.In these complicated times, this truly is a book every American should read."
2,Good game for the money,If you like drifting and racing its a pretty cool game. Plus you can change the car with body kits and so fourth.
1,Disturbing Read,"I normally like books about the supernatural, witches, etc. I loved Harry Potter and my kids and I have also enjoyed the witch books by Eva Ibbottson. However, I found this book to be very disturbing.It wasn't the one brother's death that bothered me, or the fact that his twin brother is trying to talk to him one last time. What bothered me was that I felt children were being encouraged to turn to the occult to deal with death.In one of the other reviews, a teacher said she had read the book to her class. If my child had been in her class, I would have been extremely upset. When you write a book about witches for children, there needs to be a sense that this is make-believe. The Magic Hour did not do that.If you get this book for your children, please read it yourself before you give it to them."
1,Horrible Cinematography,I love this ballet and had high hopes. The quality of the film appears that it was done with a cell phone in the back of the auditorium.I had seen the ballet live when it came to a city near me and was horribly disappointed in this 2009 DVD.
1,Left side stopped working - unacceptable at this price,"Like some of the other reviewers, I am very disappointed in this product. After 1.5 years of very mild use, the left side stopped working. For a toaster of this price, I should be able to give it to my children when they leave for college. Ironically, their expensive espresso machine was buggy as well, so I'm really skeptical of the KitchenAid pro-line products now. Will look elsewhere, and recommend you do too."
1,food sticks to knife,anything you cut with this knife will become glued to the blade and you have to force it off with your other hand. get the one with the blood grooves or you will suffer.
2,Smooth quick shave,"This is my first electric shaver. It is quick and easy. My beard isn't particularly thick, so this does the job just great."
1,Have you tried the Sun?,"I have news for you, there is no cure. Ask any competent physician, pharmacist, or person tuned in to reality. I have this stuff on my elbows, etc. So what. I offer my own, real life solution to anyone who has this mildly; people with real pain and suffering excluded (hopefully seeing a physician).If you're embarrassed by this you will need: to gain self confidence | long sleeved shirt, pants, or gloves.If it's dry and scaley you will need: moisturizer | ointment of some sort; keep trying, every person is different.If it's in big red spots you will need: try sunlight. Regularly. More the merrier. Seriously."
1,Zealously Negative Viewpoint,"I was excited to read this book, but was quickly disappointed. I rarely return books, but after reading some of this book I couldn't continue because, try as I might, I couldn't relate to the majority of what I read. The author holds zealously negative views of people, it seems. I am very introspective, feel confident admitting my faults and make a life's work of searching for how to be a better person, including learning of more faults. I was born on the cusp, gemini/cancer, but am gemini. The description of gemini was so off the mark that I read cancer, but was almost as disappointed. As I continued reading specifics for birth year under each sign I gave up. It seems this author confidently sees the world as a place chock full of extremely problemed people with little going for them (or at least all geminis and cancers). Too bad."
2,Timex T5H971 review,"I am quite satisfied with quality of workmanship. Illumination of the displayed time is excellent. Watch can be easily set-up, operated and can be comfortably worn because of its low weight (its body is made of plastic). May be, better material of the glass should be used.."
1,Not an Apple product!,This item is falsely advertised as an Apple product. It is NOT made by Apple. It is a cheaply made imitation. The pieces don't fit together quite right and the charging chord is not able to plug all the way into the charging block. When the charger is plugged in it emits a VERY loud VERY high pitched buzzing sound that my entire household finds unbearable. This charger is not worth your time or money!
2,sharpstein and associates,"yes. concerning. much like the ""it"" bert convy presented-chefs choice 120. in mr. convy's words as friedrich bismark ""it works.""talk about a time saver-one can do with this item in minutes what would take much longer w/ traditionalstones, ceramics,etc. get on its."
1,Please Avoid such Duds,"I don't have much experience with O'reilly books. All I reffered was Prog C# which I found good. I have a friend who has this book. And fortunately, I got a good advice to not to buy this book. A better approach, I was told and have used, would be to download Ant and read the Documentation. Another would be to go for some other publisher( I heard Wrox has a good title on this, but I dont know the name)(I got this feedback from at least 3 People).Please spare us such duds in the future."
1,Piece of garbage,"These people have a warranty for 60 days. There is no phone number and no customer service whatsoever. They will not respond to your emails.That being said, I have purchased 2 of these, the cloth is SHREDDING BY ITSELF. I purchased them 7 months ago, and they are literally just falling apart. After 3 months, the color completely faded, after 7 months, the material simply started shredding. This is a horrible waste of money, looks great for 3 months, and after that, you might as well flush $200 down the toilet."
1,Just like Kiss of recent years.............,"Milking the back cataloge for all it's worth. I don't have the album myself but it appears to be all the live songs from the 12 Picks & Loaded Deck album, although it would appear that this album like the other two had little if any input from Ace himself. I'm still waiting for the ""new album that should be out in the fall"". That was the fall of '95"
2,good product,"I've purchased/used these snead jackets many times before ... basically the decision was where to buy ... amazon.com was the best deal. This jacket is good for a few papers - maybe 10 or less ... if you want to hold more pages then the 1"" or 2"" expandable types are better."
1,"Donny, what were you thinking?? Why do ""Muzak"" 70's songs?","Oh Donny...what were you thinking?? This album is absolutely horrendous! (Which is heartbreaking for me to say, as I'm such a huge fan of yours. I love everything you've ever done...except this.)Perhaps if you'd tried new, fresh arrangemets for these tired, tired 70's songs, it MIGHT have worked.But why pick songs that have been relegated to elevator/grocery store ""Muzak"" when there are so many great songs out there to cover??? (And adding insult to injury, to do them with arrangement virtually identical to the originals??) I don't get it.Perhaps next time Donny will cover some classic Motown songs with cutting edge arrangements (songs he performed extraordinarily well during the concert segments of the 70's ""Donny & Marie"" Show), Stevie Wonder or other songs. (Or even more Broadway tunes, such as ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miserables and other classic shows would have been wonderful compared to this.)"
2,Love the Peguins,"Even though I was told it had a dent in the spine, it was so small and at the bottom of it that I had to look very close to the book spine to see it. It was in better condition. It also showed up at the given dates."
1,Revisits Old Stereotypes,"I'm always delighted to find a book that includes a character with autism. If that character has any special talent or ability, then more often than not that character is written as a cookie-cutter formulaic savant. To make matters worse, sooner or later others in the story compare the character to R*** M**, the title role Dustin Hoffman played in a 1988 movie. Most people with autism with or without savant abilities are NOTHING like that cliche character and R** M*** is a highly offensive slur in the autism world. I am sick and tired of savant stereotypes, especially since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population!"
2,Bad Brains are back...and better than ever!,"Reggae and hardcore punk? Yes, that is what the Bad Brains new album is all about! Sure it sounds strange, but the Bad Brains stuff is amazing. Although the whole album is good, my favorite song is either ""Give Thanks and Praises"" or ""Pure Love."" The album is completely different from anything out there right now and is definitely worth a listen if not a buy!"
2,Enough specifics to make price worthwhile,"Couldn't get it at the library, so took a chance and bought it. I've been in business a while and just wanted supplement existing knowledge. There are some REALLY bad books in this category- I think its worth about $30. I would refer back to it."
1,Insomniacs delight,"No script. Grunts and screeches replace the English language in this film.The best 2 parts belong to Raquel, and you don't see much of them.Boy gets away from his tribe of angry boys and gets taken in by a tribe of nice people. Earthquake pushes them together. Fighting, grunting and lots of breast heaving makes for a happy ending.If you can get your mind around a fur bikini (al a Ms Welsh and her chums)and still think that this movie has anything serious to say, then this is for you.For the brain dead only."
1,Can't Use in Kitchen/Tin Can,"Can't use this phone in our kitchen and run appliances like microwave, TV, etc. Called to question Uniden, and they said any cordless phone will interfere with appliances and that none should be used near any (???). Whatever. This phone sucks. Sounds tinny, and many people tell me they have trouble hearing me. I would not purchase this if I had to do it over again - total waste of money and nerves. Still unplugging and plugging back in to watch TV, etc."
1,The monitor stopped working only after 1 yr,"I have had this item for a year and I loved this item until 2 days ago when the monitor screen started to flicker on and off constantly then turns black. My guess is the monitor has burned out or something. I called the customer service to seek for a solution for this problem. Unfortunately my warranty has expired and the only thing the company will do is send me a refurbished set for $104. I am very upset because for the price that you pay ($179.99), this thing is only working for a year! It's never been dropped and is in a perfect condition. I guess you have to replace the whole set once a year. This company is unfair for charging a lot for something that doesn't last at least 2 years."
2,Good sound Quality,"It worked right away and the sound quality exceeded my expectations. High and low seemed to be a bit enhanced, so needed some adjustments in the bass treble settings."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"If you want to read about the New York City draft riots, do not read this book. As other reviewers have stated the book draggs on and is rediculously repetitive. In addition, the wording of the book makes for a very boring read, and becomes quite confusing at times.Knowing little about the Draft Riots, I was hoping to learn something. But what I realized, however, is that in order to read this book you must know much about the political history of New York, and have a great desire to learn about trade unions.How this type of book was released by Oxford press is beyond me. In any case, I found this book to be a waste of time and energy with little use or worth. I would not recommend it at all"
2,"Excellent, fits perfect the Mp15-22","I asked arround at the SW Forum and i had my option limited to 2. This was one of them. Its really a straight up installation, only consider that you require a 3/16 Allen before you start to change the Grip. It behaves very good at the range, even at high summer Temperatures...Changing the grip was really easy, no modifications required as you will need with other brands...You will not go wrong if you are looking for a new grip for your MP15-22."
1,They are what they are. Overpriced foam.,"These wedge are ok - typical foam, nothing more dense or detailed as you might expect with $100 foam. These are glorified egg crate foam pieces cut. That's all. I imagine production cost for these is around $10. And they charge $100. You do the math."
1,Falls apart,This bag started to fall apart -- strings coming out/apart -- within a few washes. I wish I'd sprung for a better quality one.
2,This series is one of the best!!,"I bought my first 6 Casca books for about $2.00 at a library used book sale. I've been searching for the rest of the series ever since. These are probably some of the best books I've ever read and can't wait to have them all! Too bad we will never know how Casca finally ends-- nobody can finish this series but Barry Sadler, and he left before the end."
2,"A game best played with friends- but oh, so fun...","I played this with a group of friends, and we managed to sit down, completely lose track of time and play until the wee hours. It is absolutely imperative that this game be played with at least one pther player if you want to get past the more diffcult challenges on each level, plus it is a lot of fun to see what your character can do, or your friends' can do, after more time playing, experience, and new skills. While not the best game I have ever played, it is a lot of fun, and I would like to see what would happen if we had four players going at once- it should be VERY entertaining!"
1,"Oh, kandi...",this album was not good at all. there were only two tracks that I can actually listen to; don't think I'm not and I wanna know. I heard the group is supposed to be getting back together. I hope so because they make good music together. 2 stars for the 2 tracks of the cd I paid almost $20 for.
2,East Central Europe between two world wars,"Well researched, objective, well organized, easily readableEast Central Europe Between the Two World Wars [History of East Central Europe Vol. IX]"
2,Corny but good,"I watced this movie as a kid, I liked it then and I like it now. You can't catch it on cable too often though"
2,Just wish it would have been longer,The problem with so many books like this is you just wish they were longer. You just get into the plot and become involved with the characters and the book wraps up. I really thought this was one of the better erotic reads - Branna suffered such shame but it was so intriguing how she hated to admit how much she enjoyed most of it. Now that to me is a great erotic read!
2,truly amazing,"For Black Gospel collectors/fans this is a very good album to have. While the sound quality varies from scratchy to pretty good, the songs and the interpretations are worth a careful hearing. Many of the arrangements (versions) are more spare than later versions. Accompaniment is piano, guitar, occasionally bass. I particularly liked the songs by the Gospel Silhouettes, which sounded a lot like Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes to me. Their ""Rock in a Weary Land"" really rocks. I liked ""My Trouble is Hard"" by the Southern Revivalists also: very plain but effective singing by soloist and backup group. The liner notes include a transcription of the texts of the songs, but they are riddled with errors."
2,You know you've read a good book when...,"Possibly the greatest set of words to ever be written down in this order. With the exception of the recipe for chocolate chip cookies, but that goes without saying."
2,good compliation,"This is an interesting accumulation of anything and everything related to Hell. The book is media based, but I found it informative and not dense, making it easier to get through. I enjoyed the different views on hell from other cultures, relgions, times throughout history. To me this different interpretations or views add to the informative level of this book and provide such a wide variety for people to relate with. I rather enjoyed the prominent media compenent of this book because I think right now the media is increasingly prevalent. I commend the author for taking on such a dense and difficult untagible subject such as hell."
1,Left me wanting more ...,"While the book is presented in chronological order, the facts contradict themselves repeatedly and I found it hard to follow her story line. Also, I wish she had gone into more detail with her interactions with the rescue workers and spent less time focusing on all the celebrities she met."
2,good produce,a good sturdy nylon belt to do weighted dips and pull-ups...waist lengths are adjustable using the chain latch. good bargain price.
1,This Album Is Garbage...,"This CD is a complete waste of your money and your life. If you like this poor excuse of an album, you should be ashamed of yourself. If you like this album...ask yourself...""Why do I like this CD?"" Flows sound like sh*t and Beats sound like sh*t...What is there to like about this crap? I just can't stand listening them any longer...These cats ain't got nothing to say...At least they tried...What the hell is happening to rap nowadays?"
2,Valuable quick and handy resource!,This valuable and easy to handle and store resource has proven to be valuable to me. I have a green house and use it all the time.
1,This product has been a joke,"Our office has utilized 2 of these in the 12 years we've been in business and although they print a little dark, they do pretty well. After an identical model started producing unacceptable quality, I purchased this used machine thinking I would be able to use all the unopened ink cartridges still in stock. Within a month or two of receiving this, the color has become absolutely washed out, maintenance hasn't helped, new expensive cartridges haven't helped and I'm about ready to throw this thing in the trash. Just love these beautiful experiences."
1,Not at all fair.,I read the book and am writing to say it is not at all fair. Bill never cheated on Hillary with anyone but me. And he loved me. So there. The book is utter nonsense.
2,Awesome CD,"This CD is incredible. Every song on here is wonderful. I have played this CD over and over again and I love every track. Brian Culbertson really has a gem with this one. Brian, keep up the good work, you are an amazing artist."
1,This really sucks rotten eggs!,"This is worst cd by Brian Setzer, i like his other cd before this one, the Dirty Boogie, but this one is really bad. Too much rap, and not enough swing. I agree with other reviewer this cd should never have been released."
1,Too boring,"I wish I had taken time to read the reviews in detail, rather than going by the total number of stars. I bought the paper back edition (not sure if other editions are different). It differed from the look inside view, very few illustrations and small print, not something a 5 year old would enjoy. The language used is also a little difficult for a child to comprehend. I also found the narration to be rather abrupt. It seems more suited as a quick reference for a story teller who needs to quickly pick a story and then elaborate it in his/her style."
2,fine,worked well in my amateur's canon powershot; been through heat and humidity; speed is excellent.
1,Terrible crayons-Don't understand other reviews!,"I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."
2,My 2rd one,Works great for me the only thing is that the light comes on when pushing something heavy.
2,amalia,What can I say about this magnificent fadista that hasn't already been said. As far as I'm concerned no one can ever even come close to this fantastic artist. She puts so much feelings into every song that I can not help but to get teary eyed.
2,HP Switch!,This is a good switch. I have had it running now for a little under a year. Still works. Would recommend it. The only mistake I made was getting the 8 port. I have a few computers at home. Xbox. PS3. A few servers. Make sure you factor in the amount of devices you have otherwise you'll end up like me under the desk constantly swapping out ethernet cables.
2,Essential to your success!!,"I started reading this book and could not stop, I read till the end! Everything about it is just AMAZING!! The concept, the layout, the choice of words, the points. And even though I already knew of everything he spoke about, I felt inspired just as if I've heard them for the first time.A great read, and the perfect boost to your success!!!"
1,Complete and total disaster,"This is not the the best CD from Patrulha do Samba. I loved the other one. It had one of my favourite songs of all time ""Rala no pezi"". Anyway, this one is horrible...almost painful. I would not recommend it at all."
1,Horizon - bad service,"bought this treadmill in Nov 05, it had to be replaced within two weeks. New one stopped working Aug 1, 06 and still has not been fixed and it is almost three weeks later. I do get to talk with lots of people at tech support, Kari, Shawn, Keo and Kristin. All of them are really sorry about the fact that my treadmill does not work but, they are not able to figure out what is wrong with it and get it fixed. They sent me two different parts and two different service companies. Unfortunately neither one could fix my machine with the parts sent and both service companies complained to me about Horizon. So, if you are lonely and like to talk to nice people who are really sorry, buy this machine and you can talk to tech support for Horizon for days, weeks and I am sure longer. Machine looks nice, when it works it is ok. When it does not work, it makes you feel stupid for buying it."
2,Frightfully Disturbing ... and Amazing,"This movie is one of the most powerful I have ever seen. It addresses the issue of race in such an amazing way, linking together so many stories and so many people in so many ways. It isn't just a black and white issue- it's black, white, Asian, Hispanic. It's fear, stereotypes, frustration, anger. As soon as you've decided one person is a villain, he does something truly extraordinary. As soon as you've decided one person is a hero, he does something despicable. Everyone walks a thin line, and the movie Crash does a wonderful job of portraying that- the cause-and-effect relationships that impact everyday interactions, and how other people put a slant to those interactions, based on their previous experiences.I highly, highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone- it will make you think. And think. And think."
2,An excellent state of the art on information retrieval,"A very good approach to IR from a computer science perspective. Well organized and easy to read although some chapter could be dry for a novice. Excellent cover of visualization techniques, digital libraries, and web searching from a conceptual point of view. The reference list is large enough (and up-to-date) to keep you busy reading more material for several weeks."
1,More useless weaklings,Expect something that would really clean. Hah! These are no more heavy duty that a face scrubber. Bad purchase for me
2,Contemporary Christian Music at its Best,"David Haas, Marty Haugen and Michael Joncas in concert--what a treat! This fine rendering of contemporary Christian music--much of it the artist's own creations; uplifts, inspires and delights. The contemporary themes and Biblical texts bridge cultural and denominational boundaries, delight the ear and develop the mind. Marty Haugen's rendering of the ""World Peace Prayer"" and Michael Joncas lovely hymn, ""On Eagle's Wings"" are two tracks that stand out in particular but the whole album is so delightful that its worthy of listening to over and over again."
1,Waste of money,"Judging by the copyright this is the edition I bought here at Amazon back in Sept. 2008 , waste of money if you're after medicinal information.. You'll get a history of vinegar ( the best part of the book), and a bunch of testimonials not much better than "" I drank some vinegar and it helped me"". I was actually hoping for some recipes for assorted ailments, didn't get my money's worth with this thing- it was almost completely useless, my copy is stuck off in a box in storage somewhere it's so useless."
1,HORRIBLE! take it from me...,"I bought this as it was the ""nicest"" (most expensive) highchair...WRONG! my baby (6 months old) hates it (too confining) and the tray is up to his eyes!!!!! Whats the point of it if he cannot use the tray? The thing is HUGE i mean huge and if you have a small space like me you'll grow to resent it. I sold it and am getting the Stokke tripp trapp with the baby rail- totally worth the extra $$ as it grows with the child (becomes a booster etc). I've heard the peg is a nightmare to clean up too.Cons:HUGEhard to clean uptray is WAY to high to ever usedid i mention HUGE?????expensive for a big piece of plastic***UPDATE***we ended up with a $20 high chair from ikea (!) that we LOVE! it's so much smaller than all the rest and cleans up so easily which will be so important to your sanity!!"

2,Murder on the Athenes-Paris Coach,You are going to love this book it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hercule Poirot is suprised to see all the different nationalities on the orient express. A murder on the train was the last thing on his mind. But when it does happen he is the only one that can find out the real criminal. The only thing he can use is his brain and a couple of clues given to him by the passengers. As he talks to the passengers he goes back to a kidnapping case that happend yeas ago. Will he find out who caused this death or will the criminal leave without being caught.
1,Unpredictable.,Collar sprays dog even when dog is not barking. It is very confusing as he gets randomly blasted in the face with citronella. Collar is easy to refill and simple to use just wish it was more predictable. I ordered the multivet which has better reviews but this is the collar I received.

1,Worst movie ever?,I would rather be water-boarded while someone poured hot wax on my nut sack than watch this chunk of poop again.
2,"Good, basic laser mouse","If you're looking for a basic inexpensive laser mouse, this one is great. I bought it for my girlfriend at Christmas for her laptop, she was sick of the touchpad, I don't blame her. My only complaint is that it's a little big for a laptop. I know, I know, I should have bought a smaller one; but the smaller one I have doesn't work well and doesn't have any weight to it. Having a mouse that has a little weight is nice, and you probably wouldn't understand until you've tried one that's feather light.I'm considering buying one of these for myself, however I'm also considering a trackball style mouse."
1,"SO BAD IT'S....WELL, BAD",Anyone who gave this piece of tripe more than one star should not be allowed to vote (or raise children).
1,load of cr#@$!,"Besides this book being written with juvenile flair,it's obvious to us who know better that it's nothing more than a throw together with a catchy selling title.Anyone who is well informed on this subject will easily spot the rampant bias and shaby research.Mr. Rigg should go back and review his account of the Wannsee conference.At no point in the minutes of the W. conference is there talk about murder or extermination or anything else.Perheps Mr. Rigg should take up a career in fictional novels?I wouldn't even bother with this book."
1,"Great scale...but, died after only 6 months.","This scale is easy to use and is very compact. However, my scale died after only 6 months of use. Tried changing the batteries, no luck. The scale never got wet. No rational reason why it wouldn't work. Save your money, and buy another model."
1,"Zero Sarts ALLLL the way! sorry..it sucked, and I returned, and come to think of it i never got my money back....","Dislike GREATLY!!! Im sorry, it was cheap, not durable, and falsely advertised....I didn't like it that I even returned it to get my money back, and I never got payed back. Anywho, Im sure this company makes great toys, but this one is very pitiful...dont buy it!"
1,Joseph McPhail,"PUT 30 LBS. IN BOTH TIRES, BLEW BOTH THE TUBES UP. USED A HAND PUMP SO WOULDN'T PUT IN TOO MUCH. THEY CALL FOR 40 TO 60 LBS. NEVER GOT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT BEFORE THEY EXPLODED, CALLED AND WAS SENT 2 NEW TUBES. WORKS OK SO FAR. NOT TO BAD A BIKE FOR A CHEAP PRICE."
2,The album just keeps getting better...,"Rarely have I picked up an album with such high anticipation (Rolling Stone gave this 5 stars) and actually ended up agreeing. First listen didn't blow me away. Second listen and I started to pick up a bit of a Beatles vibe. By the fourth listen (all in the same day - headphones at work) I realized that his album features some diverse lyrics and musicianship. It didn't sound like anything already out there - the cookie cutter does not apply to Jack White - and the album provided changes in speed, sound that make it a great album. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars (as petty as it sounds), is that although the last song is tongue in cheek, they should have omitted it. Which means I had to skip a song...so it can't be perfect, but a tremendous album nontheless."
2,Gotta love Germanic anthems!,"I was skeptical to purchase this album buy just reading a review but my fears were quelled. This is an awesome album. Kind of like MANOWAR but more ""folky"" if that makes sense.Very Wagner-ish at times. Fans of power metal should take notice."
1,didn't like the attitude,"I didn't watch the whole thing. In the table manners section I didn't like the suggested attitude - feeling superior to those who lack manners, looking for mistakes other might make and discussing them very negatively. Even though it's done for the sake of learning, I wouldn't want my children to adopt this attitude. This by itself is not good manners."
1,Videotape is Censored - Get DVD,".The Sorority Boys videotape I rented at Hollywood Video was censored.A notice at the beginning said it was edited to fit the tv screen AND for content.I'm going to rent the DVD to see if it is uncensored.Otherwise, it was a funny movie and worth the price."
1,Crossroads of boredom and frustration,"What a bone-grinding halt to such an exciting (all beit falling off) series. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. Plenty of detail and filler, but when you're done with it, you realize there was absolutely zero plot movement in the entire book.Can't believe Jordan can write 680 pages of material and describe nothing of consequence. I had read more than half the book until I got an update on the main character. Then guess what happened with him... That's right. Nothing. This series is quickly going from the best I've encountered to the most disappointing.Next time TOR and Jordan will have to earn my money with a few good customer reviews before I buy. Please quit selling me filler."
1,Not very informative book!,This book does not give any how to! It is little info from here and there.Not a complete project for reader to follow up.Over all I was disappointed.
1,Not like the real thing...,These are a little cushion that is comfortable to wear in a loose shoe. They do not do anything else as far as anti-cellutlite effect while wearing. I would not buy again.
1,1 horrendous movie that deserves 0 stars,"A crime against L. Ron Hubbard's book, Battlefield Earth, has been committed in the guise of Battlefield Earth, the movie. I spent the whole movie, eyes glued to the TV, telling everybody ""No, this is nothing like the book! The book is great and this is awful"". The characters were flat and some were not at all as written. Most of the characters in the book never made an appearance in the movie. The plot had only the vaguest resemblance to the book.I wondered how they could make a good movie from a book that is 1050 pages long. Now I know they just took the name and trashed the rest. I was amazed that L. Ron Hubbard did not come back from the dead to sue them for destroying his work. The book is GREAT, read it but avoid the movie like the plague!"
1,Garbage,"Amazing! When you open the box, you are greeted with WM-Pros not WLX-Pros. It's printed right on the modules!Transmitter range is awful!Mic is tinny and cheap sounding.High pitched buzzing noise, regardless of channel 1 or 2!Mic level signal is too low, but since it's noisy, there's no point to increaing the gain.I feel cheated and scammed. I truly hate this product!$140! Yeah, it's not that much, but I expected better performance. This system is no better than the $35 Sima system, at least it did not have high pitched buzzing.Garbage!"
1,Not a book I would recommend,"This book has a lot of hard, degrading moments about rape, abuse and alcoholism. I did not enjoy reading it, and would not recommend it to my friends."
1,Did this have a point,"As I waded through this book I kept waiting for some sort of revelation. Rhodes skirted around it and never actually allowed the reader to make the leap until the end of the book. I get it: the dog meets a lot of people and somehow touches thier wretched lives. The reader has no idea why and further begins to wonder why they are reading this book.Regarding the ending. Skip it. It is brutal and unnecessary. Ask yourselves, would a spoiled English Brat really brutally murder a dog because he is having some undisclosed crises? No. Rhodes and the reader would have been better served had the dog lived and somehow this weak novel could have been tied together."
2,Guys will enjoy this novel too!,"The characters are marvelous. The plot was interesting. The prose did not measure up to the characters and the plot, hence the rating of a 9. Readers of Joe Gores's novels DEAD SKIP, CONTRACT NULL AND VOID and GONE ! NO FOWARDING ADDRESS and Carl Hiassen's TOURIST TRAP will enjoy this novel as it is written in the same style."
2,Wonderful panty,"These are great, comfortable, true to size, sturdy and long lasting panties. Well worth the price. I just wish they had them in size 8."
1,Disappointed,"I've not read much of Tom Clancy's work, but based on what little I have read, I held out much hope for this book. It definitely did not deliver.While the action ""scenes"" were quite fun, they were also rather repetitive. There was very little plot, and no character development. The end result is a story that is about as believable as a Rambo movie. I very seriously doubt that the entire Chinese navy, which was being constantly augmented with Soviet boats and crews, could be eliminated by a single sub. I don't buy it, and neither should you."
2,Sonicare essence toothbrush,My sons dentist told him to use this toothbrush after some extensive dental work and bonding. It is an amazing brush. Nothing else performs exactly like the sonicare. He had his checkup this week and the dentist was very please with the care of his teeth. The only thing different has been the use of the sonicare. Excellent price on Amazon.
2,Intense Pop,"I have a vinyl copy of this record which sounds gutsier, but has a mark on a couple of tracks. This is a great pop record. As good as Oasis but with more harmony. I can just imagine the Britain they are singing about.An intense but melodic record."
2,I love it!,"This is fun to use, and highly effective (much more so than those ab lounges) it's impossible to have improper form with this bench, and it folds down for storage quickly and easily.I definitely recomend this."
1,THESE GUNS SUCK,both my guns are broke after a month of being used 30 mins a week.I TOOK GOOD CARE OF THEM TO!!!
2,A must for any Nanci lover!,"A wonderful cd, definitely Nanci at her best. Check it out, you won't be dissapointed."
2,awesome product,This bag worked great for my kayaking trip to protect my camera...would buy it again
2,Good book,"The first section of the book is very insightful. Baldwin relates three accounts of well-known, daylight disappearances in which the missing person virtually vanished in plain sight. Likewise, this edition offers updates not in the original text, which make these cases even creepier. The search attempts are well-detailed, and the time and man hours involved make these disappearances even more baffling.The negatives are minor, but I do regard the last couple of chapters involving the at-large convicts as little more than filler. Also, the Kindle version is poorly-formatted, and reading the book is very trying in spots. Nonetheless, much of the book is a real page-turner, and I would recommend it."
2,Awesome Theme Song,I haven't actually heard this release but own the original Japanese. It seems that the Princess Mononoke theme song was dubbed in English - by a woman? The original Japanese song is very beautiful and I doubt anyone else could do it justice. The original was sung by a male counter tenor and is incredibly moving. Maybe I'll like the dubbed version as well but we haven't got the DVD or soundtrack available in Australia. Listen to the original song too.
2,Handy and compact,I'm a contractor and carry small items. This bag has strong zippers and is easy to maneuver and holds quite a bit.
2,Absolutely Great Stories,"It makes you wonder how the Southern Confederacy managed to lose the war having such stalwart spiritual guidance.To those interested in the Great War I also heartily endorse Col. Thomason's book called ""Fix Bayonets"".In an interesting twist the books were both written and illustrated by the author."
1,Complete Junk,These earbuds were the source of all my frustration while running. The only way these things might stay in your ears is if you glue or tape them in. I lost my mind with them for 3 days then got the Sennheiser MX70 earphones and have never been happier.
2,Youth Fantasy Finest for Girls,"First I would like to say, that I love this book mostly because it was the book that introduced me into the world of fantasy. And because what animal-crazed junior high student doesn't want a book about a girl who can talk to animals.Plot: 4/5; Its not extremely complicated but very enjoyable, and not totally predictable.Characters: 4/5; Daine is the wounded soul that every teen thinks they are, and its easy to connect with her as she tries to find her place in the world. I really enjoyed the other characters as well, especially the Riders. They added a lot of fun. (Gotta Love Sarge)Sexuality(5/5=romance w/no sex): 4/5; No romance in this book, though it does develop later in the seriesRecommended Age: Jr. High Students (11ish and up)I do love this book because its a great story about magic and finding yourself. Not to mention lots of animals. Fantastic for animal loving preteen girls"
2,Ever wonder....,Where some sitcoms shows you watch today get their ideas? Watch this show. The stars as well as the supporting cast give lessons on how to be funny!!!!!
2,a little much,"I have owned this tube for a few years. It is a great piece for close-up work however I find that it is somewhat extreme. You get really close up, which is great for some subjects but not so good for others.It is so close it's hard to focus on the entire subject sometimes. If you want extreme closeness, go for it. If you what a little more versatility, go with the 12 II version."
2,Beautiful,"I absolutely love this necklace! It is by far my most favorite piece of jewelry, besides my wedding rings. It is very elegant, not to mention it goes with whatever attire you choose. The chain is very thin, which makes this beautiful, the clover and peridot compliment each other very well. I bought this in honor of my grandmother's memorial, she was a very proud Irish woman! I never take this off. It's not cheaply made at all, very strong and durable (I have two toddlers who pull at it when I hold them). The quality is remarkable, no turning colors, still very shiny and polished looking even though I've had this for a year! I'm very pleased!"
1,Ummm...no.,"What is up with that ridicuolous ""prego rap""?! And the 5 mintues of silent time where all we see is kathy & the others laying on the floor for 5 WHOLE MINUTES! There are parts where the voice is dubbed over, the exercises were not effective AT ALL & the arm moves get a bit confusing at times. I just didn't find myself sweating or even feeling somewhat energized after this routine...I felt cheated. Like I needed more. It is way too outdated too. I almost wanna call it lame. I DO NOT recommend at all. Obviously I wasn't impressed & will be selling my copy on ebay."
1,Wasn't as expected!,"I picked this radio after many hours of going over reviews. When I openned the package it felt cheap! The band selector moved up and down with too great of easy. Didn't know which band I was in. Am reception was good. FM reception was excellent. Shortwave reception was terrible in my house, regardless of the room I went to. The reason I returned it was that it would not shut off. I had to remove the batteries to shut it off!Now looking for a portable shortwave radio again."
1,Boring conflict,"I read the description for this - dragons, vampires, Atlantis - and I was hooked into buying it. I'm sorry I did.The hero is a guardian of Atlantis; the heroine is a human wondering around trying to find her brother. She stumbles into Atlantis, meets the hero, love at first sight, but! He's got to kill her because she found out the secret that Atlantis exists.That's the conflict - he's got to do his duty and protect the secret. But I know that since it is a romance novel, he's not going to do it. The hero killing the heroine doesn't scream happy ending. The plot goes on and on, his dueling emotions drag out until I want to smack him. Then finally, three quarters the way through the book, he decides he can't do it. What a shocker, let me tell you.The worldbuilding, the setting, the imaginative story were all wonderful. The conflict between the hero and the heroine ruined all that."
2,Awesome!!,951 questions and answers!! This book was essential to my passing the NCBTMB the first time. I learned a great deal from this book and well as from Volumes 2 and 3. I was surprised at the number of test questions about Traditional Chinese Medicine. This book provides a great deal of information on that topic.
1,Way too simple.,"The recipes in this book were far too simple. Unless you are extremely new to food preparation, it is an unhelpful book. Recipes include simple things such as how to make a sandwich, dips, and a bagel with cream cheese."
2,CNN America Remembers,"This excellent DVD will bring back 9/11 in full force. It is not political in nature but replays what occurred that morning with commentary by CNN reporters on their feelings, what they were doing, what they did when it happened, etc. We must never forget!"
1,doesnt really suction.,I bought the 3 bowl set with the hopes that it would hold the bowl to his high chair tray just enough to enable my son to pick out his finger food without spilling all over his lap. Alas it did not. I feel dissapointed that i basically just bought 3 plastic bowls as the suction part is non functional for more than 3 seconds. Ive tried using dampness to create a better seal and its to no avail. my advice? save your money. this is a great idea but someone has yet to put it into practical implementation.
2,"I trust it, enjoy it, and open it first.","I've had this book for quite a while, but had to write after being shocked by some quite negative reviews. Apparently there's one in every crowd. ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"" is a compendium of many cooking styles, and everything I've made from it has turned out brilliantly. Delicious, with attention to healthful, seasonal preparation and ingredients. Unless you don't live near a decent market, her ingredients are quite available or easily subsituted. It's laid out simply and intelligently and her comments in the sidebars give the recipes personality. These sometimes quirky comments, combined with my experience of success, give me the feeling that she (unlike some other well-known authors) has actually used/developed the recipes in the book. I turn to this book often for advice, inspiration and good food. Highly recommended, and I trust it."
2,"Isn't it funny how its either 5 stars, or 1?","Honestly, Imzadi is still my favorite book of all time. No book has ever captured my interest, and I've read a lot in my little teenage lifetime. One thing that I've learned is that you should always see if you like a book for yourself, for only your mind can judge the quality of it."
2,Better with each listen,"I love it. Just wish he'd included Island Jam. Pretty mellow stuff but it takes you back. Thankfully no cringing tunes at all (like Dogs of War and a couple off of About Face), and several that are real standouts (Where We Start, On An Island, Smile, The Blue).Congrats to Dave for making the album he wanted to make and not cashing in completely on the PF brand. This album will go plat anyway without it.Extend the US tour for a second pass!!"
1,Utterly frustrating,"Indeed it would have been nice if Motorola Phone Tools would work under OS X, but I wasn't really counting on it in the first place.However, even for a computer addict like me it's cumbersome to say the least, to get it working (after removing all modem drivers, which can be impractical for internetters..). I've been corresponding with their helpdesk for over two weeks now, and although I got it running, it still won't see files that are on the phone (Motorola V3i). The other way around, the phone doesn't see files that are put on it in Phone Tools.Not to mention it won't read addresses from the phone. Updating it to 4.0.4 doesn't help. I didn't even try using Bluetooth, since I hear nothing but doom-stories about it.I can't believe a large number of people use this, since most users give up on software that doesn't work after under 5 minutes."
1,Some broke,I ordered a bunch of these for my MIL's surprise birthday party and the arms would break off or flop over so that the pictures would't stay up.
2,An excellent book which teaches the basics of ventriloquism.,"Have you ever wondered how a ventriloquist can ""throw his voice""? Wonder no more! ""Ventriloquism in a Nutshell"" teaches you the basics of ventriloquism in ten easy to follow lessons. Hillarious illustrations make studying this interesting more even more fun. Plus, Maher Studios entitles anyone who buys this book free help, information, and advice. I've learned ventriloquism from this excellent book... You can too!"
1,Not Original Recordings,"I ordered this product based on the customer image provided. I owned the pictured item on LP, and assumed the CD was the same item. It is not. What I received is a ""New stereo recording by original artist"" - part of the ""Legendary Artist series"". I was disappointed, especially because the LP pictured contained the long version of Crimson and Clover. The CD I received has a re-recorded short version."
2,Amused,"I am always amused by reactions to end-time teaching. It's a volatile subject, especially if you believe that Christians will suffer. End-time theology is something I've tried to stay away from because there are so many ""opinions"" and though most disagree with each other, they all have convincing arguments.The LaHaye series has done much damage to lull the Christian community into their usual ""nothing bad can happen to me"" view. This book makes more sense than any I have ever read on the subject. If you believe in the rapture before tribulation, reread your Bible. God never takes us out. He brings us through. What I liked about this author is that (for me) he demystified Revelation by tying each scripture to an Old Testament scripture."
1,Not ready for prime time,"I work for a well known computer store which I shall not name so that it is understood this opinion is mine.Having had to deal with NIS2004 and NIS2005 on 6 different customer 's systems we lose more time trying to either deinstall and reinstall the software after the customer has purchased and tried to install it, or because the product simply stopped working. I certainly would not reccomend the purchase of this product by a novice or anyone other than someone advanced enough to edit the registry to completely remove all traces of the product in the event of the need to reinstall.Norton should also do something about their ""hit or miss"" activation system. It has taken me up to 10 try to activate the product. In fact, only once have I had the activation occur on the first try.Furthermore, this product does appear to cause problems with other software which was running prior to the installation of the product.This product is not ""Ready for Primetime."""
1,"Nice design, but poor quality","I bought this set of headphones to use with my iPod while jogging. I like the black & white color and compact folding design, but the poor quality of craftmanship drops its rating substantially. First, the headphones could not be used with the treadmills at the gym because they would build up static electricity and shock the ears (the classic yellow ones that came with the Sony Walkmans years ago never had that problem). But even given that limitation, I would have still given this product a 3 or 4 star rating if it were reliable. However, the left speaker went out after only 5 months, rendering the headphones unusable. Sony provides only a 3-month warranty on this item, of course. In contrast, I still have a set of the old-style yellow Sony Walkman headphones that are still working fine (it just doesn't match the color of my iPod)."
2,samsung vga 1000,"i absolutely love this phone! just swithced from verizon to sprint and its way better! color on the phone is exceptional. one reveiwer stated that you cant see the time on the outside LCD w/o opening the flip, this is not the case, simply hold the volume key down for a few seconds and the outside LCD will ight up. the sound and clarity of this phone is awesome.i do agree that the manual is very basic, but the more that i play with the phone the more i am discovering exactly what it can do and it can do alot!! i recomend this phone to anyone. so far so good w/ the battery life. the only thing that i dont care for is when you download ringers, you cant preview them first w/o buying. other than that ...i love my phone!!!!!!"
2,bought 2nd one for my gf,"I bought first one 2 years ago for my XPS 13"" laptop...still works great till this dayjust purchased second one for gf...so I definitely recommend this product...fan bit noisy on the high setting but I usually run it on low anyways"
2,Creative Guitar 2: Guthrie Govan,Extensive picking exercises really get your fingers doing the stuff that's tough to do. Lot's of insight from the master. Really a large number of variations on each topic so there is bound to be something that will highlight a weakness of yours. Then it's up to you to spend the time practicing them. The CD is great for improving over as well. A steal when you consider what lessons covering this material would cost.
1,Poor hearing...,"Not sure what other ppl who wrote a review for these headphones heard. I put them on and listened to Jango on my Toshiba Thrive. Sounded like I had cotton in my ears. Bass is good no mids at all but the highs sound like they are being clipped. Like listening to sound through a fan. I plugged in my older cheapo buds and the sound was 10 times better. I bought the Panasonic headphones mainly to Skype. Haven't tried that yet. Will update. But hey, what do you want for five bucks."
1,Size issue or size matters,"I like 3 m filters, I used them in my old house all the time. My new house take 4 inch thick filters so I order a 4 inch filter. The box says it 4 inch but it is really 4.25 or ,4 1/4 which means it does not fit. Nowhere on the it the box does it say the filter is larger. I have to bend the filter in order to get it to in the holder. Out over $100.00 on filters that do not work. 3m should know better."
2,My review,I like the story of Les Mis It is a classic story and a good one. I have never read the book.
2,Doowop Heavy Hitters,"Their combination of a bass-man on steroids, a good tenor and syncopated rhythms bouncing off the walls and ceiling make them my favorite doowop group of them all. Of all the various treatments of BLUE MOON, theirs is the wildest! Why not five stars? This isn't everbody's kind of rock and roll, and despite the album liner's claim, they were pretty much a one-hit wonder."
1,"very poor low budget production, what a shame","very disappointed as i watched it. very few footages, just 3 or 4 being interviewed, filling up the videos with ridiculous, stupid, low budget pictures to fill the gaps between interviews (i can do this on my own!!! just simple editting and visual effects!!!). i think what syd's fans want to see most is first hand materials, not all these meaningless craps just to fill up the screen. what a shame! it's like using syd's fame to earn money by producing such a poor quality product."
2,"Sweet, dude.","I got turned on to this music at a hockey game, I've been describing it as the ""go king king go"" song (cause that's what it sounded like when I first heard it in ""Excaliber"") and could never find it. Then heard it on a commercial when I was near a classical music type person and was able to buy it (run a search for ""go king king go"" in Amazons search engine!).I'm sure everyone has heard this music, but not this quality. Other versions I've heard (like in movies, commercials, and hockey games) are almost indecipherable. The music overwhelms the singer people in the other ones, this version seems to me to be what the composer had in mind. Of course, the composer is probably dead so I don't know for SURE what he had in mind.Seriously, this has the best balance of the 2 or 3 versions I've heard. I wasn't until after hearing this disk that I found out that they don't EVER say ""go king king go""."
2,Kind of Lengthy but Good,A long and meaty film that satisfies. Hard to believe it really happened. Highly recommended for an evening's entertainment.
2,Thin but MIGHTY,"This book may be thin in size but it is MIGHTY in the information contained. I'd taken a leave of absence from sewing and changed shapes in the meantime - older patterns didn't fit anymore. With the help of this book, I'm back in business AND have learned all kinds of things I wish I had learned years ago. Can't say enough good things about this very easy to understand, logically presented book. Way to go Lynn."
1,These were NOT the correct size.,"Since it's hard for me to find jeans with a 29 inseam in stores (yes, I have short legs), I ordered two pairs of these Levi's 550 size 34x29 about 4 months ago. I love those jeans, because THEY ARE THE RIGHT SIZE. A pair I ordered just recently SAY 34x29 on the patch on the jeans, but they are at least 2 inches longer than my previous purchase. What gives? How hard is it to keep your product the same size? Were they just mislabelled at the factory?I stupidly washed the jeans, figuring maybe the other pairs had just shrunk a little and that these might also. Nope. When I line them up, the new ones are still 2"" longer. Since the whole point of buying these jeans online was to get the correct size, this was a complete waste of money, since I can't return them now.Update: I'm changing my rating to 2 stars because it turns out I will be able to return the jeans, and customer service was very helpful."
1,A BLACK ANDY MILONAKIS!!!,"Puffy is the worst rapper ever! Correction: Puffy's ghostwriters are the worst ghostwriters ever! Puffy's delivery is deadly dull and the beats ruin every timeless classic he sampled. It's true that other producers sample beats but the difference is that they make you appreciate those classics Puffy makes you hate those classics. Standout Tracks: Every song featuring Biggie might have been a standout track if puffy wasnt on them! Filler: Pain, Cant nobody hold me down, Friend, Is this the end, Been around the world, Dont stop what youre doing and the rest of the album! Puffy is where hip hop went wrong so unless you are ready to hold him responsible for his actions(opening up the door for hip pop icons) dont bash jafool into oblivion for participating in hip hop's destruction!"
2,"Good product, would recommend","The H700 has so far been a good purchase; it easily connected to my Samsung phone, it has good volume, it's comfortable to wear, the battery life seems good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that after polling people during the first week of use, most people noted that the headset didn't sound quite as good as the phone itself - not surprising and not a problem, but it keeps it from getting a perfect rating."
2,Excellent short work,"This short work about the events leading up to an interplanetary battle is still one of Clarke's best. The battle scene at the very end of the book between The Acheron spaceship and the moon base, which has developed a strange, molten-metal beam weapon which works in a vacuum, incorporates a very usual idea and I thought was very well done.Clarke's discussion of the political issues between Earth and her colonies, The Confederation, that eventually lead to the climactic battle scene, are also well done. If you liked this book, you might also try Robert Heinlein's books, ""Between Planets,"" and ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which also deal with the issue of the Moon or other planets attempting to rid themselves of the colonial hegemony of mother Earth."
1,Warranty is useless.,"A word of warning. The metal on these tents cannot support any kind of rain at all. On our first use, our tent collapsed during a rainstorm, with no less than four of the metal supports shearing right through. Some of the supports poked through the canopy itself. The warranty specifically states that ""This warranty does not apply to damages caused by wind, rain, or other forces of nature"". In other words, if you ever use the tent outdoors, and it gets damaged, the warranty is VOID.On another note, this tent was standing directly next to an older tent from another manufacturer, and that tent survived the rain with no damage whatsoever."
2,The series is in good hands!,"Though I was at first apprehensive about another author taking over my favorite series, but having read this, I can simply say... Keep them coming Todd!"
1,What?!?!,Horrifyingly bad...The plot seems to revolve around the story of disjointed characters that go nowhere and do nothing save getting in deep trouble every 30 seconds whereupon they escape to go about getting into trouble. Plus...how does freezing someone send them into a past that never existed? Yeah...really...bad...
2,Another inspiration..,"Another wonderful book, thank you! You will take away so much more than your expected, enjoy!"
2,A wonderful guide for anyone curious as well as experienced.,"I found this book to be extremely interesting and informative. I, being somewhat young, have learned much from this book. My partner, who is older and more experienced, also found this book extremely useful. It is nice to see that we are entering into a time where men can be open about their sexuality and comfortable themselves. I would recommend this book equally to younger and older sexually active people. A great companion to my other reviewed books."
1,OK for large pieces,"I bought this product because it got a great review on America's Test Kitchen. I liked the idea that you could remove the handle and ""shut"" the grill cover - instead of having the handle stick out. Turns out an older basket I have for steak, which enables me to adjust its ""height"" to accommodate thin or thick pieces, is much better for handling fish - even though the handle sticks out."
2,AMAZING!,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this mat! Nothing sticks to it! No more struggling with sticking fondant. I wish I had this mat a looong time ago! Made my cake jobs such a breeze. I am in LOVE with this mat!
1,Not as good as Snugglers. Leaks!,"We have tried several brands of diapers and different styles within the line from Pampers Swaddlers, Swaddlers Sensitive, Huggies Little Snugglers, Luvs, Kirkland and now these, Huggies Snug and Dry. Our favorites so far have been the Swaddlers Sensitive and Little Snugglers because it had the softest, cushiony quilt but they don't make them in size 3 and up. The Huggies Little Snugglers run a bit smaller than the Pampers Swaddlers. We've had rear blow-outs with all of these at one point or another but we've had the most with these Sung and Dry ones. The inner fabric doesn't seem to be as thick or as absorbent as the Little Snugglers and it is definitely not as well fitted. For breastfed babies whose poop is more runny, these don't work. They don't absorb fast enough and ends up leaking through the back when you lay baby down to change. Now we are off to try the Pure and Natural which a friend says is much better fitted and cushioned."
2,Straight to whats important,"I decided I wanted to get more in depth with photography and sought after a good guide to help me get started. I did not want something too basic to begin as I knew I would just get bored. Also didn't want anything too advanced as to just confuse and frustrate me. This book is a perfect example of a photographers guide. He doesn't just talk about techniques and show examples. He actually has all the details involved. Studio setups are illustrated clearly and easily. He also has a photo of himself taking the pictures. He tells you the camera and lens used and you get a real sense of how he uses his camera.There is a section on different cameras including 35 mm, medium format and 4 x 5 large format. Brief descriptions but still helpful. Studio design is covered, darkroom, etc.Very valuable resource for an interested photographer. I am planning on purchasing his basic book next as this book has definetly convinced me to buy many more."
1,binding is horrible,"it arrived on time, it is a new book but the binding is horrible . it is coming apart in multiple sections of the book"
2,ExtraSpectaculary,Thievery Corp. does it again. A powerful compilation of extraordinairy sound. These DJ kicks albums always sound so damn good within the genre of the artist.
2,great book -- gets you through the basics -- quickly!!,"similar to the dummies series, the idiots version was proofed a little more carefully before it went to press. A wonderful book for beginners or experienced computer buffs who want to get the basics out of the quickly"
1,Cut right through,"I live in a pretty high bike theft area and was naively sold this U-lock from the local bike shop. Within 6 months of using this lock, it was cut right through with some kind of buzz saw and my bike was stolen. The bracket is awful! It wouldn't secure the lock and I've had the lock fallen off the bracket while riding. If you live in a low to moderate bike theft area, this lock may do but I would go with a sturdier lock like a Kryptonite in the future."
1,It was terrible,Very disappointing. This movie is not at all as good at it looked in the previews- and I wasn't expecting much from that either.
2,I believe that Hell was a terrible place and she confirms.,"The book is a real eye-opener and anyone that read it, should realize that hell is not a place they would want to spend eternity. It's real and you have a chance right now to make up in your mind where you want to be."
1,Big disappointment,"The best thing about the book is the Fireworks demo that comes with it--saves time downloading it from the Macromedia website. I spent 30 minutes with the book and knew I would get no use out of it. It's vague, confusing, and the instructions are choppy. This is the first time I've ever rated a book online but I was just that disappointed."
1,A total scam!,"The 2 VHS tapes that make up SHOWBOAT COMPOSER: JEROME KERN are nothing more than a bad VHS reproduction of the 1946 MGM musical biopic TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY. Of course, they don't tell you this anywhere in the advertising of the product, so what you think you're getting is some kind of documentary about the life and work of composer Jerome Kern. You can buy a re-mastered DVD of TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY on Amazon for $2.55.Till the Clouds Roll By (Remastered Edition)If you want to see this movie, which is quite splendid, buy that and not this worthless piece of junk, which cost $10."
2,Plumeri's Tchaikovsky is a treasure...breathtaking in beauty!,"Plumeri's Tchaikovsky is a treasure...breathtaking in beauty, masterful conducting, and the quality of recording is superb! It's brought me back to my best moments of listening & feeling through classical music while renewing my appreciation of Symphonies 4, 5, 6 in a new light. I highly recommend this 2-CD release."
2,¡Tremenda obra! Wonderful novel!,"¡Jesús Pedro del Campo Montes: La Conciencia de Puerto Rico Asesinada es una tremenda obra! Este es un trabajo literario de un contenido histórico profundo, de interpretación fácil y una narrativa amena y elocuente. Capaz de mezclar hechos y personajes reales de la historia y vida actual del pueblo puertorriqueño; capaz de hacer reír y llorar al mismo tiempo. Esta obra podría ser un medio de introducción al entendimiento de la historia de la colonización de Puerto Rico por el imperio más poderoso e inhumano en la historia del planeta tierra, con el drama de lucha y desafío de un pueblo. La obra nos da la oportunidad de conocer el drama de un pueblo a través del más grande de sus hombres; es además oportuna para entender los atropellos y colonización de otros pueblos de América y del mundo. Gracias, Armando Pacheco Matos, por otro de tus muchos aportes contra la ignorancia de los pueblos.Dr. Rafael Gerardo Herrera"
2,Wow,"I remember when I was a kid in the 70's running around listening to this album, brings back great memories. All of these songs are a must have for anyone born in the 70's."
2,gory and thrilling,"I am unashamedly a fan of Simon Clark. Blood Crazy is fun, frightening, heartrending, gory, and always entertaining. Did I mention gory? I hate gore. But Simon Clark's books are so entertaining that I just close my eyes and skip right past those parts that are too hard for me to read. If you enjoy zombie/PA/disaster tales, you will enjoy this book."
1,"Bad, bad ""China's Columbia"" !","I'm from Russia. Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com. It's made in Vietnam. Thread sticking everywhere(( I can send you photos, write to greengel@yandex.ru. Sad, I just wanted buy good quality Columbia, but got ""bad Vietnam"". Also, i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot ""Columbia"" from China! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm, be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world... Sad."
2,Not too bad for the price,"I just wanted a simple MP3 player, nothing flashy. And that is exactly what I got. I haven't had too many problems, except one night I was scrolling through my player for about 10 minutes looking for different songs and just by having the light on all that time killed a brand new Lithium battery!! That's faster than a digital camera! The only other thing is one song on it kept messing it up. It would sound scratchy and weird and caused the player to freeze up. I determined it was the MP3 and not the player.Other than that, I love it! I think it would be great for a newbie or teen!"
2,Nova Developments Print Explosion,"Simply the best software for creating personal projects. Contains hundreds of ready made templates for just about anything you would need or want from cards to banners, signs to crafts, labels to envelopes . It is easy to navigate with the graphic interface. Thousands of clipart images and photos are include for just about any occaision and all are 100% scalable"
2,Strictly Confidential Attraction,"It was a good book. A very quick read. It is something different from the book that are being but out to day. A kinder story, with love, not shooting and cheating."
1,Author is clueless,"There are far more credible authors to spend your money when purchasing a book. Dale writes for various rags which regularly display his limited knowledge of the underwater hunt. While many species can be taken by tank diving, a comprehensive hunter understands you must be silent in the water to even see certain pelagic species. He is overcritical toward ocean hunters far exceeding his talents and basks in the bliss of he knows all. Ignorance might be bliss but it doesn't translate into a great read. Skip this limited read and jump to authors like Terry Maas, Carlos Eyles, etc..."
1,awful,What? I am so confused. I thought the two male leads were friends and the older man wanted to be with the younger one. Ugh when I read that they were father and son I really wanted to change the channel. I didn't enjoy this film at all.
2,Outstanding Stain Remover.,"""OUT"" Pet Stain Remover is one of the BEST PRODUCTS out there, it really WORKS! I have been using it for years and will not do without it. Any time my little Poodle gets a tummy ache and vommits, I go right behind her squirt the product and wipe it up, it leaves no residue behind and smells refreshing, the carpet comes back like new!"
1,painfully annoying.,"although this cd has recieved its fair share share of radio air-space, it is still poor. I am always stunned at how people can put up with the vocals, the blokes voice is hideous. The band is also poor live. All in all a sub standard cd and generally over rated."
2,excellent book for children,"I bought this book in a local bookstore out of curiosity. My 5yr old loved it. It's humorous and the ending caught us by surprise. This story also gives children the opportunity to participate (when the rocks ""rumble"" after coyote).I'd recommend it for kids up to age 10. My reason for not rating it 5stars is this: There isn't any info. included on the writer. As a Kiowa-Chickasaw woman, I always like to know who is writing the books under AmerInd. subject matter and their background/experience. I bought the soft cover. Maybe the jacket on the hardcover has this info."
1,Check your state laws before buying,"I bought 2 of these, but didn't have enough of some letters. If you shake the frame a certain way, then the letters slide over/under each other if not secured. I regret not checking my state's laws before buying; if I use it on my car then I could get fined because it blocks over a certain % of my state's name. Now the frame is just in the box in the garage. :("
1,"Couldn't wait for it to end....unbelievable, go for the non-fiction Marcinko","I'm not sure Dick did much of the writing and if he did this book seemed totally unbelievable. I was looking for something I could believe in, but found myself feeling like I was watching some action movie, without all the special effects. It may work for a movie, but the book just did nothing for me. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't watch it,"Totally forgettable and not worth 3 cents, much less what it cost to rent. Most of the cast should gracefully retire."
2,Mobil Base,Was easy to put together. I have them mounted on some heavy shapers. Roles easy. Machines are stable when they are locked down. Does everything I wanted at a good price.
2,Excellent!,"This book is the most in depth Harry Potter I have ever come across, with carefully researched data and rules of thumb that can be used again and again for all the books. Although it does resemble a computer document that hasn't been completely reworked (i.e. emoticons, misspellings) all that is worth it, and makes it more interesting to read. The book takes you through each of the HP series books, keeping up a running commentary and explaining when a key point has been made. At the end of the book, in the ""restricted area"" the authors tie together any loose ends by making preditions about the end of the 5th book and the ultimate end to the series."
2,Saved me from lots of grief,"I read The Partnership Charter as I was about to enter into a partnership to start a business requiring large amounts of startup capital which I had almost finished raising. Upon reading this great book, I realized that my partner was not the one to do this venture with and I pulled out at the last minute. I thank David and this book for saving me from a great deal of anguish and aggravation. Had I entered into this partnerhip, I would have ended up doing the lion's share of the work and would have had to break up the partnership."
2,I enjoyed this book immensely,"I'm not into serious spy novels, and couldn't solve a puzzle to save my life, but I do like some intrigue and this fit the bill for me."
1,not something I would recommend,"I purchased this product a couple months ago. It does take very nice pics, but, the darkness of the photos is disappointing, as well at the trouble with downloading via the usb port. Even with fresh batteries, an error message pops up. Essentially, you have to quickly download the images, transfer them, and erase them in about 30 seconds, otherwise it won't work. Minolta tech support isn't available when I need them, so that eliminates any help from them. What initially attracted me to this product was the price, and the small size of the camera. However, I am not impressed with it one bit. Suggest spending a little more on a better product, to avoid the frustrations. I am considering selling mine and purchasing a different product from a different manufacturer."
2,How did I ever take indoor pictures before this?,"I have just gotten back into photography after a very long time away from it. I spent lots of time looking for the right camera (Nikon D80, awesome, btw) thanks to my brother-in-laws help. I mostly take outdoor shots, and really didn't think a flash would be my next addition. Until I was taking some indoor shots of my kids. So, I started to look for a flash. Again, my brother-in-law to the rescue. He pointed me towards this flash, and now I'm hook. The many years away from real photography has given me a chance to be impressed by all the new tech, and this flash is a great example. Between my computerized camera, the fancy lenses, and this really smart flash, I can't take a bad picture. My first picture was just a snap of my home office and I was so impressed that I haven't stopped taking indoor shots.I could go on and on about this flash, but the bottom line is that this thing cannot be beat. It's a great price for an amazing piece of equipment."
1,Grammar for Language Arts Teachers,"This book is a little overwhelming at first glance. The authors state that the intended audience is for language arts teachers. I think that it may be more useful for high school teachers. The language in the book is not conducive to early learners or for people who speak English as their second language. As you learn and struggle through the middle chapters, you find yourself starting to understand more of what the book was trying to say in the first chapters. Therefore I think that Chapters 10 and 11 should be the first chapters in this book. I have heard somewhere that a writer should revise first, and then get down and dirty with grammar. Chapter 11 is about revising, which is why I think it should be first and not last.This book was fairly confusing to me; the examples in the chapters were not the best to use for classes. All in all, I would recommend this book for a reference book, but definitely not for a classroom instructional book."
1,Not for Grownups!!,"Im a 20 year old male who thought roller coaster tycoon was awsome so when i recieved ps2 this was the first game I bought. To even put the two im the same sentence is ridiculous. The ps2 version is looney and requires no actual creativity and skill. The rides are all predone for you and building a roller coaster is childs play. Although my 5, 8, and 9 year old brothers do enjoy it even though the all prefer tycoon also."
2,Fun!,"We bought this for our granddaughter's first birthday. She loves it! Her mom says it was easy to assemble. She is tall for her age and has no problems making it bounce. However, she needs help getting on."
1,"This is a recount of events, no feeling at all.","This is not a good movie. It recounts events leading to the success of Facebook. There is no feeling at all, very little character construction, no photography, nor good music. It did hold my attention simply because of the fame of Facebook. I was surprised how arrogant, sexist and racist are these geeks."
2,Awesome,If you enjoy cooking with lots of spices this is the only way to purchase the quantities you need. Hooray! No more need to make weekly trips to the grocery store for small containers.
1,Isle of Dogs,"Sorry, someone please tell me, Patricia Cornwell didn't write this book...I read 1/2 of it and just could not finish. I don't know if it was a tongue in cheek, a book meant to be funny, as in a parodity, but it didn't make it..I want the realPatricia Cornwell to come back in her next book like all the others she has written, full of mystery, excitement and guts.I am one of her biggest fans, love her work, but not this.."
1,Learn Mexican Spanish,"The product is good. But the price is outrageous. The regular Spanish course with 5 CDs from the same company is in the retail store about $[...]. This one SINGLE CD Amazon charges $[...]. I expected to receive again 4 - 5 CDs, especially for the price being more than tripple. That is criminal! I am sure there is no plausible explination for it. So far I found maybe 3 or 4 words which are different from the regular Spanish."
1,Below what I expected,"Swizz's second album realise, quite anticipated by most of his fans after a three year wait it is about time. However, not as good as the first some of the tracks on this album are noteworthy. Shyne an excellent track, a nice beat. Also the rest I think are ok in which I mean mediocre. Lil Kim, Busta, Styles P. and Eve are a few notable rappers on this album. What I think on my final opinion, well it could be better. Swizz might wanna keep his rhymes in the closet for now. The first star I gave him he deserves, the second I did for the horrible effort."
1,This teacher is not happy.,I've had this sharpener for a week and a half and at first it sharpened great...now it is already broken. I barely used it. I tried to take it apart and see if something was stuck and preventing it from working....and it was cleared out..still does not sharpen at all.Very disappointing.
1,BEST LAXATIVE EVARRRR!!!,Whew! Finally off the pot. This stuff will cleanse your digestive system with the quickness!I felt as though i was prepping for a colonoscopy for 4 days until I stopped using it.Everything is back to normal now thank God but.. I will not use any again. Still have several pounds of it left. any takers?
1,"Brevity, Clarity, Plausibilty -versus- Prolixity, Opacity, Implausibility","Although this book does contain some useful, practical information, it is buried in a forest of non-essential modifiers, unnecessarily obscure polysyllabic terms, and tortured sentence structures. Cicero wrote that the essentials of a rhetorical presentation were brevity, clarity, and plausibility. Of these three essentials, ""The Realm of Rhetoric"" comes close to achieving only the third, and doesn't achieve that one well. The plausibility of an idea decreases as the opacity of its presentation increases.The ideas expressed in this book, if expressed with brevity and clarity, would probably make a good essay. Expressed with prolixity and opacity, they make for a tedious book. Aristotle, an author not noted as an easy read, did a much better job over 2,000 years ago in his seminal work ""On Rhetoric."""
1,not what i expected,the flim sarted off good and then kind of was a let down.i really wasnt clear why the girls killed themsevles. after a while the plot just seemed to drag.the good things about the movie were the perfomances i esipically like joshharnett as the small but important role of trip fontaine. overall i felt the movie could be a lot better.
1,Worked for about a month or two and then ran into errors,Now I am unable to even eject the cassette so if I wanted to replace it with another one I can't.
1,All fight and no substance,"My brother, the late Joe Stewardson, was supposed to be in this movie. His name was on the cover, but having watched the whole movie and carefully scrutinizing the credits, he is not in this movie. Having watched the movie, I am happy that he is not."
2,Excellent for hemorrhoid cure!,"This isn't for this specific brand, just ACV in general.I bought a bottle of ACV off the bottom shelf at my Kroger grocery store.I applied ACV with a cottonball directly on my hemmorhoid. The next day it was half the size.I continued a couple times a day. After a few days, it was totally gone!I lived with this stupid roid for 2 years before finding out the cure was $5 on the bottom shelf at Kroger."
2,MAXIMUM OF LIFE (track 13) OH MY GOOD GOD!!!!!!!!!!!,"No beatting around the bush I ADORE maximum of life (track 13).Maximum of life is S T U N N I NG!!!!!!!,i'll tell you how AWESOME i think it is..........I cry my absolute heart out EVERYTIME when i listen to the song,i don't mean a little tear i mean REALLY cry (noise,tears,mucus,EVERTHING!).mustang! also has some really really really peaceful songs,such as sleep,where where where,river,sunday & of course FEVER (although there is a VERY different version on the free your mind 33 record which is a hip-hop version & better.good luck finding the record but it's worth it).Rainy day & day was released as a single in japan (from the animation VIRUS),it's a bass/drum driven song & very cool (when i say bass/driven,i mean stand out sound from drummer makoto sakurai & bassist ikuzone baba).My friend sounds alot like disarm (the smashing pumpkins song).kj (d.a's head) is a hugh the smashing pumpkins fan & it shows."
2,Robert Merrill,"This is the first volume in a series of the earliest commercial recordings by Robert Merrill. Some of the material is trite, but the voice - the instrument itself - is, of course magnificent. Merrill had a 40+ year career, and retired when he was still in fine vocal shape.These early recordings show the youthful freshness in his voice, in excellent quality due to Preiser's superb restorations. Preiser, without exception, has ALWAYS done a masterful job restoring 78's. No gimmickry -just good clean sound. As it should be. Any restorations on the Preiser label are worth obtaining. They totally respect their subjects."
2,Great !,I want a heater to use when I didn't realy need the furnace. This heater works great. It is very quiet on low and on high you can just bearly hear the fan. The remote work well and the timer is handy to set it to turn off at a later time.I use it in my livingroom which is 14x20. the unit does a very good job of keeping it warm.I would buy it again!
1,worst toy,"this toy is the worst toy i have ever laid my toy-loving eyes upon. i expected to be puzzled by this puzzling new board game adventure, but instead was left throwing the horribly boring puzzle pieces around the room in a fit of rage."
2,essential,"The material features french horn solos from two of the best in the business--Julius Watkins and David Amram. Fuller and Hawes must have been in the mood for something new and different here as co-leaders; french horns just weren't used much for soloing in jazz back then. The album, comprised of originals by David Amram, Teddy Charles and Salvatore Zito, features musically enlightened hard bop for the period. If you don't have it, grab it.Curtis Fuller (trombone)Sahib Shihab (alto sax)Julius Watkins (french horn)David Amram (french horn)Hampton Hawes (piano)Teddy Charles (piano)Addison Farmer (bass)Jerry Segal (drums)"
2,Perfect just like I heard,You can never go wrong with a Mario game. Playing it on Wii is just all the better. I love how you can get so much more involved in the game.
2,Excellent DVD - If you can handle the truth about the human body.,"National Geographic - Inside the Living Body is an answer to every day people who are interested in finding out how the body works. The microcosmos of internal organs is revealed in a big view of the human anatomy and function of our daily metabolism. Technologic advances in video recording and computer animation are used in this exceptional DVD to allow us to understand the living body. I recommend it a 100%, you will not be disappointed!"
2,"Yep, an OK album","I am a big Jennifer fan. This particular CD is a great CD, but it takes several listenings to really fall in love with it - unlike 'Abrazame y Besame', which I fell in love with on the first listening. Personally, I like the Cumbia songs on this cd best, especially 'Corazón Bandido' and 'Fuego Lento [Version Cumbia]'. The catchy 'Que Me Ame Más' is also a big winner."
2,Just Add Rum and Mix...,"Looking to vibe out with some ""elevator music style"" steel drum music? Then you found the right album. Now, some would take elevator music the wrong way; don't get me wrong.This is cheesy in a good way. Great chill out music or jamming behind a BBQ in the yard. Just crack open a Red Stripe and enjoy. Easy breezy, good, innocent, fun music. Keep the margaritas and rum runners coming...thank you!"
1,don't buy,"Just save the 3 bucks and buy a better pair. The 1st pair we bought were scratched so we sent them back. The 2nd pair are bent so we are just going to let our kids play with them. They seem good, I read the reviews that stated they loved thwm, but really they are not. They are very cheap and flimsy."
1,This Stunk,"Sam Yeager - the truly despicable Quisling wife stealer in the first series, is now the main character. To my great disappointment, he has not been executed for treason, as he deserves.Instead of dealing with the alien invaders the way would really would have as soon as we gained a technological advantage (attack and complete subjugation of all survivors), Turtledove has us all trying to get along for some reason. The result is an utterly boring novel. I kept waiting for the shooting to start. It never does so don't bother reading this dreck."
2,If only I were Spider-Man...,"Wow! This movie is amazing! The special effects will blow your mind! Spider-Man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance! It's the ultimate movie-lover's movie. I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary-Jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection. A beautiful face, and excellent talent. Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a ""breakthrough"" actor, totally mainstream. I can't wait for the next few installments in the Spider-Man series with Tobey and Kirsten. This is a great movie, take the family and some friends along and enjoy!"
1,Superficial and dishonest analysis,"As a Catholic theologian and ordained clergyman, I am embarrassed by this sort of superficial analysis. This is not a sincere attempt at establishing a serious dialogue, but a cheap caricature. Moreover, the author's own views are presented as though they reflect Catholic tradition. Instead, they reflect Catholic modernism, thinly veiled. I accept historical criticism and the legitimate gains made by modern scholars, but the view of Scripture in this book is much closer to liberal protestantism than to the Church's official teaching. Fundamentalism serves as a convenient surrogate for attacking the Church's own high view of inspiration and inerrancy. What a shame. And a sham."
1,Don't waste your money,"You won't get a lot of useful info out of this book. There is a limited listing of cocktails, and two chapters on bar jokes and practical jokes. One tenth of the book is a glossary telling us such valuable things as 'jack' refers to jack daniels and a five dollar is a 'five spot'. Another chapter deals with landing a bartending job with sub-headings such as The Want-Ads and Friends and Relatives. The quality of the writing is what you might expect from the content.I mean, really,.... :^p"
1,Not as comfy as i thought it would be for the money :(,"I bought this because my back & belly need some support while sleeping...but this pillow doesn't help. It's WAY TOOOO BIG..for my queen size bed..It divides me & my boyfriens up completely..i always have to sleep with two pillows under my head, so this pillow doesn't allow me to because it's so bulky..I have now switched this pillow around & reversed it so the Head Part of the Pillow is now at my feet & I use it as a foot elavation pillow. NOT worth the $$$ I would just buy the Tummy Wedge by Boppy for Belly Support :) Cheaper & does the job! Hope this helps any new mommy's out there...I wonder if i could send it back?? It's been a little over 3 weeks?? Hummmm??"
1,Dissatisfied Custormer,"I ordered a 11x14 binder, and the one sent to me was an 8x11 binder. I am still trying to return it."
1,Horrible quality,We bought this book new from Amazon and it fell apart the moment we opened it. The binding is poor quality and soon the pages were everywhere...complete waste of money.
2,front end service kit,Bought this for my son as a gift. Primarily for heavy trucks. Works great and makes the job of replacing front end components a lot easier.
1,In my opinion I thought tis book was awful.,"Sorry to say I hated this book alot. Sure it has its thrills, but it was awful. I always look for new books to read. So I decided to look for opinions online and I found this book. Of course the only reason I was looking was because I was bored stiff. I love stories about vampires. The authors I love to read are Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and J. K. Rowling. Its hard enough to wait for their books to come out. So I always look for new books to read. I liked Kerry and Ethan a little I guess. The fact that Vande Velde vampires can be killed by the sun bores me. I prefer the knife in the heart way. All am saying is that I hated this book, but thats my opinion. So don't let my opinion stop you from buy this book."
1,very dissappointed,"Alright... so I finish reading the newer Weiss & Hickman books, and while they're not of the same flavor as the older ones, they show a level of writer maturity and solid plot lines, not to mention excellent character development. Then the story ends and ""Dawning of a New Age"" picks up. I've always been apprehensive of Dragonlance books outside of Weiss & Hickman anyway... and now I truly know why. The plot was all over the place, character development was very shallow, and it fealt like I was playing a board game and not reading a book - I'm sorry, but there should have been better editing before letting this hit the market. Yikes."
1,"This book is a nosense, Spain is not the third wolrd.","In that book Clancy translate the spanish sentences whit a computer and you can see that some are false. The ""Guadia Real"" is not a elite group of de Spanis army. And there are not any political problem in Spain, Catalan and Basques arel good people an we have our diferences but we won't do other civil war. And If someone wants to take the control of Sapin, he won't go to the Royal Palace it is a nosense, there are other political and military places more important than the Royal Palace."
2,Great sewing book,This is a very good book for some one who is just learning this skill. Also lots of more advance techniques.Only problem is it could have better illustrations.
2,A Heartwarming Read,"Irene Brand's ""To Love and Honor"" is a heartwarming read about two great people who deal with the aftermath of a long ago tragedy. Violet, the heroine, finds out that people show their true colors under pressure. And she is fortunate to find a man who is more than able to love and honor her. Very realistic story. Lovely ending."
2,A solid book,Finally a book written for practicing professionals. This is a book to have on your shelf. You'll be amazed at what these two can teach you.
2,A hardcore classic.,"A.C. have the kind of mindless humor the kids love, but unlike their first two Earache albums, once the joke gets old, they have the music to back it up. Once a blast of unfocused noise, A.C. combine sludgy guitar riff-o-rama with fast as hell drums, and what you've got is a collection of several very brief, very punishing hardcore songs. They're not just for breakfast anymore."
1,"Three old men, too old to rock and roll....","I cannot believe that people actually listen to the live Cream reunion CD and compare it to ANY of their live stuff from the past! There's NoFire in their instrumentation, and the vocals are weak. N.S.U.? It's a joke! Everything sounds like it's being played at half-speed. It might have been phenomenal to see them live again after 35+ years, but I don'thear it in the music. Compare Live Cream, Volume II to the 2005 versionand you'll hear the difference."
1,Another Poor Attempt at a sequel!!,"I thought the 3rd intallment of this series was awful, but this one is worse! I'd give it a 0* rating but 1, is as low as it goes. They should have never changed the Djinn charactor, in Andrew Divoff! He played the part the way it should be played, and I don't think anyone can replace him! If they ever decide to make another one of this series, they better give him a call back, and get a well written script!!DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!"
1,BEWARE - INACCURATE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"This battery is NOT the correct part for a T23. I can't attest to the other models. The battery may well replace the part numbers listed, but they are NOT the ones for a T23. I bought this item for my son, who lives in another city, knowing that he needed a battery for a T23. The battery delivered does not look like this one, and as I found out when I got the part number from my son, the ones listed here are not for a T23."
1,like the price but,like the price but it ha no structure to it an just flops over with the tools in it.you would have to fill up the center with a bunch of stuff to actually get it to stay upright.
2,One of Smith's best . . .,"If you like fiction / history with Smith's brand of adventure and intrigue, you'll love River God."
2,Neuemburg interviews,"I am a personal friend of Eli, and first read some of this material at his home in NY. I was unable to respond to my emotions other than to say ""the world has to see this"". Handwritten pages of interviews transcribed every night to typewritten pages. Pages filled with the most mundane complaints concerning prision life, only interesting because these people were the architects of the most well known genocide of my life. That the author was a Jew and able to distance himself and gain the confidence of these people is nothing less than amazing. I an very pleased to see this in print, it came very close to being lost forever."
1,An Alternative to Argulles,"This is for reviewer CHRISTOPHER FUNG. If you found Argulles' work to be a load of mallarky, you might find an alternate study of the Mayan Calendar interesting. Swedish Mayanist/authro Carl Johan Calleman has written a book on the subject and he is in strong disagreement with Argulles' conjectures (and this whole Dreamspell business). He even sets a completely different date for the end of the Mayan Calendar (a year earlier). Hope you find this info useful."
2,"DVD's good, CD is NOT any of the original soundtrack","I loved getting these DVD's plus the followup set that is in the light blue packaging... but OMG, the CD that comes with this ""red"" package is horrid! NONE of it is the original vocal tracks... it's the goofiest cheesiest studio singers... I mean come one... if they could get the rights to put the shows on DVD, why couldn't they get the rights to put the song vocals on a CD? Lame"
2,A Must Have,"What better subject for a talented artist to explore than the beauty of youth. As usual, Hamilton, presents his subject in a compelling and idyllic fashion. I also just recommended the Rituals of Summer DVD at Amazon for the Hamilton enthusiast. Perhaps Hamilton will follow the lead and create DVDs from his numerous video titles."
1,Prepare to wash your eyes.,"This book changed my life. For the worst. I used to be a functioning member of society. These sayings have lead me so far astray that my own mother refuses to speak to me. Or perhaps it's the creepy cover of this book. Those eyes, they haunt me. I used to be happy."
1,'A' is for Alibi,"Received on time if not early. Book looked like it was in good condition. However, it was old and brittle. Literally fell apart as I read it. I would check the source of where you purchased this book or others from the same source. They will all probably disintegrate."
2,Wonderful music cd for Chanukah,"Wonderful selection of chanukah music including traditional melodies, new arrangements and original pieces. This CD is sure to become a holiday classic."
1,I agree!!!,I plugged in the handsfree to my c417 and had my ear blown out by a blaring screech. Trash!!
2,Loved the web site too!,[...]This man has something to say to all who will listen. I like the fact that he gets down on a level everyone can understand. I must admit I have tried reading certain books in this category and they went way over my head going on and on about all the scientific aspect of how they came up with their conclusions. I hope the doctors of this country take this book to heart and start reaching to get an understanding of a broader way to help people. With this book I think we could see a turning point and the doctors of the next generations will be doctors with an alternative approach.
2,High pedigree: Gal Costa with Cesar Camargo Mariano,"When you read my reviews on Elis Regina's albums you will certainly know of Cesar Camargo Mariano, one of the greatest arrangers for singers in Brazil. He was her arranger for many many albums, thanks God!, her best ones.I am used to saying that no matter the singer is, if the arranger is Camargo Mariano, buy it.This is the case for this Gal Costa album. Beautiful renditions, beautiful arrangements. Buy it."
1,Has no industrial value,Fan is to weak for any other than small room home use. But theres better models for that so I say boo.
1,"DOA, poor docs & windows 8 support","The unit we got would not work with 2 computers Windows 7 or 8. The drivers would install, and the OS said it was there, but the light was off and it did nothing. The cable was short and the pen seemed poorly constructed. The documentation did not match the product in the box at all. All the pictures are different and it was all written for XP.After finding the Digipro manufacturer under another name I found that they do not support Windows 8 64 bit which is what most machines come with today. This product needs a revamp and QA."
2,Value,"Received the item in a very timely manner, plus the value cannot be touched by any local store here in central Missouri. Would shop there again."
1,Quickly slapped together,"This book contains the sloppiest prose I've ever read. I'm glad Kristin Gore has worked on SNL and sitcoms, but she needs to learn how to write!"
1,Irrelevant rubbish,"It does not often happen that a book is rendered useless by a single sentence. This is one of them. Apparently in an attempt to legitimize the hideous cruelty of the inhabitants of old Mexico the author makes the following statement:Every people, it is now generally supposed, has its own right to conduct itself as its national customs provide.This is so incredibly stupid that it makes the author a self-professed idiot and therefore irrelevant. Fortunately it comes early in the book, so that no discerning reader need waste too much time on this garbage."
1,NIV at best OK.,"I have a non-Kindle tablet and am very disappointed in the lack of features available in the Kindle reader available to us. Things like ability to search easily are key and seem to be missing. This makes the experience of using the NIV Bible less enjoyable. The proprietary format is annoying. I have a GNU reader that is feature packed and cannot use it. I suspect this will be my first and last book from Amazon.I downloaded a free version from an app store that is much better laid out, easier to use and has many more features than this version."
2,Interesting..,"As the name of this book suggests, the book is all about, well, memoirs of a geisha.. :-)Before I read this book, all I knew about a geisha is that she's a Japanese girl who provides entertaining and lighthearted company to men. Nothing else I knew.. However, this story revolves around a geisha and with every page I turned, I got to know more.The strong point of the story is the way the memoirs have been presented. The way the entire plot has been weaved, makes it an intersting read.In fact, it was after reading the book that I was even more interested to watch the movie when it hit the theaters."
2,Great handheld steamer,"This steamer works wonderfully. I bought mine about a year ago and have used it to help final out of two military houses so far. I've recently used it on the linoleum of our current house to get dirt buildup from the previous tenants and it really works great! I love it. I use it around the entire house: kitchen, bathroom, baseboards, doors and handles, window sills, window trim, etc."
1,jim,"The service was fantastic the cologne is horrible, and I must have close to 50 types, I wasted my money on this one"
2,A five star certainty,"A simply brilliant album - clear five star stuff. To think I had never heard about The Ocean Blue until recently. Now I just cannot stop playing this album. If you like precise and infectious melodies, superb guitars and albums where EVERY track is great, get this one!"
2,A Portrait of Love!,"""Portrait of Jennie"" is a fascinating exercise of a most inimitable romance between the mysterious Junoesque like Jennie and struggling artist Eben Adams. Hollywood A-Lister's Joseph Cotten and the beautiful Jennifer Jones provide captivating performances in a tale of an artist and his poetic inspiration.In a unique cinematic exhibition, the movie, filmed mostly in B&W; changes to a green tint during a stormy scene, changing to sepia for an adjacent scene and ending up in full Technicolor as the camera zooms in to the completed ""Portrait of Jennie"".Dimitri Tiomkin's celestial musical score is another delightful aspect of this movie. All thru the film you will hear Claude Debussy's Arabesque #1 and other Debussy works.A most delightful 86 minutes of entertainment."
2,Consumer Reports Correction,"Another reviewer said: ""Consumer Reports who compared Bose with other products that it sued (and lost)""Bose won... the ruling said: ""The District Court found that Consumer Reports ""had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard..."". The ruling was later overturned only because the higher court did not find ""actual malice"". [In short the courts agree with Bose but didn't award any money because there was no proof that Consumer Reports did the report to be mean.]Reviewers don't like to be sued. Every since the law suit, reviewer tend to be bias against Bose.With that said... Bose aren't worth the retail price but are great speakers when you can get them on sale."
2,Incredible Story,"Got this book from someone in my family, she belongs to a book club. They met this author and said the author was really down to earth and the story was true, so I read it. I love this book. I did feel she could have had chapters, but my cousin said its because she wrote it in conversational format. ITS A GOOD READ. I would say this book should be given to every girl living in the hood. What this author does makes her a brave woman. I am very proud of her and to know she has made it through. not everyone can say that. FIVE STARS IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH."
1,nothing new here,"Lose weight, stop smoking, drinking, coffee, become a veggie, yadda yadda. Nothing interesting or new here. I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
1,Too bad you can't give 0 stars,"I was so excited that the woman who shaped my pre-teen and teenage years had come out with a book that I thought would shape my mid-twenties...so I bought the hardcover 2 days after it came out. I have never been so disappointed in an author! I read the book with half interest--Blume fails to develop her characters and any sort of plot, which is sad because there was so much potential. I got the feeling that she wrote the book with the hopes of being recommended by Oprah...I hope Oprah saves her money--or she can get mine at our garage sale next week."
2,High School Algebra,Here is a down-to-earth book on the essentials of what a student should know by they time they leave high school.
2,couldnt put it down,"i bought this book for a friend of mine in the music indsutry when it came out just because it had interesting musician reviews on the back. i picked it up a few days later and started reading it. i thought it was a great story, very entertaining especially to someone like myself that knows nothing of the inner workings or of the music industry. but once i picked it up i couldnt stop reading it. i even held off giving it to my friend a day so i could finish it."
1,Broken on arrival,"This was one of my son's Christmas presents. It wouldn't work when we opened it, but would repeat our words in a garbled tone. I thought it was the batteries, so we went out and purchased three more. The new batteries didn't fix it. Since I didn't think it was worth sending back, I opened it up and discovered that the wires going from the battery to the circuit board were damaged. I soldered new wires on, and it works now.It does change your voice, but isn't a great toy. He, nor his two brothers, used it very much. I tried playing around with it to get them interested in it, but to no avail. It does work, however, after replacing the defective wires."
2,catcher in the rye,""" its funny."" "" All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they'll do practically anything you want them to."" Holden Caulfield, chapter 21.This book grabbed me from the beginning. The story of a boy struggling through school and getting kicked out. Im sure pretty much everyone can relate to Holden in someway.The story is about a boy named Holden who attends private school and has been kicked out of a couple and is now leaving his current school called Pencey. Summed up the whole book is him telling his life story.The book didnt really impact my life that much. I did some research about the book and such and what I found was that supposeably this book encouraged Mark Chappman to kill the beloved singer and song writer John Lennon a former band member of The Beatles.I personally thought the overall book was good. It didnt take me long to get into and didnt take me long to finish but i also enjoyed reading it."
1,II only wish the whole CD was as good as the 1st 3 songs!,"I bought the CD after hearing ""Barely Breathing"". I couldn't believe how wonderful it was during the first three songs and was making a mental note of the number of CDs that I was going to buy to give to friends to share his great work. Then..... the rest of the CD played. It put me to sleep and I was emarrassed that I was going to buy this to hand out to people. I am very hopeful but hesistant about ""Humming."" And I thought I had found my replaement for Toad the Wet Sprocket. I hope the next CD has a lot more spunk."
2,Good First Work,"I enjoyed this. I must admit, I bought the book because it had Starhawk's name on the cover (and I adored Spiral Dance), but I found that this first fictional novel of hers was loverly. At times the style was a bit jagged, but that sort of thing smooths out with time and experience. A good read, that you can go back to a second time. The ideas behind the plot are worth contemplating too.Blessings."
2,Nice CD,"Great Value... Great CD's... Great Brand... I've always recorded ""Maxell"" as long as I can remember from cassette tapes to VCR tapes to discs."
2,value price,The production suits for people who need a AAA battery very often. I have a canceling-noise headphone. So I decided to buy this one.
2,handcuffs,ay first i didnt like them they had rust on them but they are sending me another pair out today. so they are not a bad company thanks guys
2,Good book for Spring!,"This is a really cute book. A little girl finds a seed, plants it, and then cares for the sunflower that grows. At the end of the summer, she gets the seeds from the sunflower and later shares them with her class so that they can grow more sunflowers the next year. It's a simple story but one that is perfect for this time of year and would be a great starter if you are going to garden with your child."
1,Misconceptions,"Knowing the history and facts behind this fictional story gives alot of perspective on this paticular review. For any individual that had or has access to any of the actual public and sealed documents concerning this case, it tends to leave a great deal of food for thought.When a mistake is made by any government agency, of course, it's an embarrassment, especially considering the last couple of decades for a reminder.Some folks in this great nation are finally realizing that our government and law enforcement agencies are not infallible and that when put in a compromising position will do just about anything to save face and funds.It's not a pleasent reality that this portrays, but unfortunately true.If given the oportunity to find fact from fiction, would you take it??"
2,A great introduction to Vietnamese-American literature.,"This is the first book I've read by a Vietnamese author, and I enjoyed it. It gives you wonderful insight into the values and customs of American and Vietnamese characters. I thought it had bit too much poetic description mixed in with the story, but that's just my opinion."
1,Sad indeed!,"I struggled through this book filled with horrific descriptions of agony and suffering, simply because I thought it was true! In fact, I frequently told myself that no one could make up something this attrocious! Essentially, it's the only way I was able to endure the entire book. As I turned the pages, I found myself wondering how he could possibly remember the details so clearly, given the fact he was out-of-his-head much of the time. Midway through the book, my husband asked if it was a good book, and I explained that if it were a fictional story, the author couldn't write himself out of a wet paper bag, so in a word, I described it as ""sad."" Turns out the ""sad"" part is that I paid good money for this drivel!"
2,LOVE IT,"I love that the shipping of this product was within the time limit, and it arrived fresh and it smelled to good. i use it on hair, mix it with shea butter for the body and hair actually. TIP: if you melt shea butter and add coconut oil to it and put it freezer overnight(so it won't be grainy) it will stay softer, i think because the coconut oil is not as solid as the shea. Also i use some coconut oil in my rice, sooo good."
2,The Best Grammar Book,"I taught writing to law students for six years and searched for the best grammar book available. Ed Good's is easy to read and follow (a high schooler can follow it), and is comprehensive to the point that even I learned things I had not known. As I tell my students, grammar is the clothing in which you dress your ideas. Just as you wouldn't go to an interview dressed in ripped jeans and a t-shirt, you shouldn't dress your writing in sloppy grammar that distracts from your ideas. This book is the equivalent of a bespoke tailor. If you need grammar help, get it."
1,UUUGH,"When I was younger. this book would have thrilled me to read about black people like this..after all did they really exist??A young inquiring mind would have asked..Well I am a lot older and wiser..This book is pure fluff..I am so glad that this book was at the library, if I paid for it, I would have asked for a refund immediately. Save your time and your money..Try reading Pearl Cleage.."
2,"Fun, well-written, laugh-out loud comedy with heart!","This movie was extremely well-written, well put together, and just plain fun! Bob Newhart as Papa Elf was perfect for his role. Ed Asner was a great Santa Claus. Will Ferrell was terrific in his role as Buddy the Elf who goes to New York to find his father, played by James Caan. The magic of Christmas comes alive throughout this comedy. It is sad how cynical adults can be sometimes and forget what is truly important. Buddy's persistence pays off in finding his way into his new family's heart. A holiday classic!"
1,Disappointing,I was looking forward to this as I love Brain Age for Nintendo DS. But the professor who speaks to you is so discouraging. He accuses you of being a slowpoke in life and then he says you set a record. My 7 year old says that the professor is dumb. My 9 year old won't play it anymore after playing it twice. I find that my ability to play varies widely from day to day and I don't think it is my brain function. It is more likely related to how quick I can press the remote. I am remarkably consistent on Brain Age for Nintendo DS and Wii Fit where I see steady improvement. I do not recommend this game.
2,cool,OOOOH wow XD definately getting this. I hope it's as good as the bratz rock angelz. That one was really good ^^
1,"SWG is going console, prima guide is on this site","here is Amazon selling the guide to SWG on console, so do not waste your money buying it for PChttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761542272/103-0476274-7920615?v=glance&n;=283155&s;=books&v;=glance"
2,Cheaters,"Cheaters was a very real book that takes whoever reads it into someone elses life. Through lies, cheaters and real friends. It shows how cheaters cheat and how the ones that get cheated on react. It's sad, funny , and crazy at times and it tells it all like it is."
1,NOT a reliable Coffee Mill!!!!,"DON'T BE FOOLED...even though these LOOK like the original Kitchen-aid models, they are NOT of the same quality. Mine died a year after purchase; however my vintage '50s model is still going strong. Don't waste your money on these overpriced knock-offs. Buy the vintage model on eBay or elsewhere. Not only is it cheaper, but it is mechanically MUCH MORE RELIABLE."
1,WEAK WEAK WEAK . . . and did I say WEAK,"OK, so the story moves along and for awhile I was pretty engrossed. Then I started to get bored. Then I started to get frustrated. We are led to believe that Ray Atlee, an Antitrust professor at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country, can't figure out how to safely hide some cash? Give me a break. The main character's idiocy alone made me want to throw the book through a window. Another small point, John: How can you assume that your readers are so stupid that they don't understand the basics of estate taxes? One of the early premises of the story is that Ray wants to hide $90,000 from the govt. so that he wouldn't have to pay 50% in estate taxes . . . and his attorney agrees with Ray's concerns. Hello, anyone with the intellectual capacity to read your books knows that there are no estate taxes on estates valued under a certain ceiling (I believe $700,000 these days). At least get the law right if you are going to print this drivel of a story."
2,Taking control of our own lives,"At first, I just went to the place at amazon where it says: ""Already Own It? Rate It"" and I clicked on ""five stars."" Then I was referred to other books I might like based on my rating. They referred me to books about writing for children! NO. This book is not about the ABC's. It is about scapegoating. Glasser is a psychologist who works a lot on helping people (children and adults) learn to take responsibility for personal behavior. Children and adults need to break free of the ""blame game."" This is an insightful little book. I highly recommend it."
2,"The ""Difficult"" period of Steely Dan","Although recorded flawlessly, and with another top notch stable of rock and jazz musicians, the only flaw in this disc is that it failed to break new ground for Fagen and Becker. Also, conside the fact that it was their follow up to Aja. That is a tough act to follow."
1,Maybe I've turned into a prude...,"Am I the only one who doesn't think a song about a pedophile (Godfrey) is cool or cute on a children's record? This album has some real gems on it, and I will admit to chuckling the first time I heard Robbie Fulks sing ""Godfrey."" (I sometimes laugh at South Park, too, but not with my toddler in the room.) I have to ask all the other reviewers, as well as the folks at Amazon, what does it say about us that we find songs suggestive about pedophelia cool, hip and appropriate for our kids? If my objection makes me a prude, then that's a badge I will wear with honor."
2,Ignorance,Those who do not understand this book lack the brain power. It is not the author's fault that his words may fall on the ears of fools.
2,Loved it!!!,At first I didn't think this was going to be a movie I would enjoy... But it happens to be one of the best movies I have seen this year... Anthony Hopkins is great and there is never a dull moment...
2,Bright bulbs......for a while,"These bulbs are very good. Driving at night is a pleasure with the bright white light. I originally bought these just prior to a solo cross-country drive from Oregon to West Virginia. They were so bright that as I got tired, I had to go to low beam because the lighted area was so bright. That is the upside.The downside is that I have had very poor survival for the bulbs. They seem to burn out quickly. I finally decided to buy a second set so that I could have a spare set in the truck with me all the time. That way, when they burn out I can swap in a new bulb and send the original in for its warrantee replacement. They are not convenient, but they are the best I've ever driven with."
1,An American Knockoff of a French Original,"See the French ""Les Visiteurs."" Its far, far funnier than this lame attempt at an American re-make. The sad thing is, the original French version, with English subtitles, in NTSC format, doesn't exist, or no longer does. My library has a copy, which is how I came to see it. I understand that this may be Part 3 in a series, but it was awful and hard to watch after watching the original first. If you own a Region 0 player, then by all means buy ""Les Visiteurs."" Not this."
2,Good info,"I've been looking for a book about paganism that isn't so centered on Wicca. This is a good one. It's a workbook style so that has helped me too. It has a lot of good info in my opinion. I wouldn't say this is a book for someone already well versed on their Pagan beliefs, but it is a good one for those of us just starting down our path."
2,excellent,it was an excellent buy and full of knowledge and information.have no regrets making the purchase. i should have had this book long ago in my possession
2,Works!,"Good and simple design, easy to install. My chimney flue is oblong shaped, so the the L metal pieces on the length side are positioned inside of the flue, but I bent them outward and that solved the issue! It is slightly wobbly after installed due to the simplistic adjustable-fit design, but I think it is going to stay there even in high wind. We'll see!"
1,Broke in 6 months!,I was very disappointed with this product. When I walk outside I noticed our pond was not working. When I examined the unit I noticed the plastic flanges that hold the plastic grate over the impeller were broken. Since the plastic grate could not be secured it place the pump could not build pressure to pump water. I did manage to fix it with some large zip ties. It has been working this way for about 4 months.
1,Not Squirrel Proof,"Don't be fooled, a hungry squirrel is much smarter than you Heritage Farms! As I stand here looking out the window, we see a fat squirrel hanging from the top of the feeder upside down, working the feeder mechanism to get his grubby claws on the food, with much success and what appears to be little effort. Later, we see him actually inside the container! Meanwhile two little birds stand idly by about 10 feet away awaiting thier turn at the trough.My wife has tried several of these sham feeder products to no avail. If anyone has found an actual squirrel proof feeder, that also allows birds to feed, please contact me."
1,Not worth the price,"I was all excited when I saw a fully waterproof 6.0mp camera for $119. Well, that's where my excitement ended. The camera takes bad pictures. They have a strange hue to them. It can not be adjusted. The video is horrible. Whatever setting you use, they will be washed out. The battery indicator shows drained battery even with brand new ones installed. The shutter speed is the slowest of any camera I have ever seen. Most pictures come out blurry. No optical zoom. Just not a good camera.Better spend your money on a nice Olympus waterproof model."
1,vanishing breed,"This is certainly one of the lowest quality books in the genre. As a Trakehner breeder myself, I had hoped for something special. Very poorly put together, with characters so apallingly trite, flat and awful, this story is just a waste of time and energy. Ugh."
1,Poor Fit,"Sorry i had to review this... I got this 5 years ago and i've been using it to work ever since. The first thing i noticed was the straps were to short to snap at the back of the chair so because of it, it does not rest well and ends up sitting on the side. I have to constantly move it in the middle because the way the straps were made makes the backrest move to the side. This will only work for small chairs not the one's you see at work. I have yet to find a good one but for now i'll just add a pillow"
1,The Emancipation of Whoriah Scarey,"Mariah really needs to stop using words becasue they sound intelligent, cause nothing on this album resembles anything near an emancipation. It is a cheap beat-driven 'album', which can't even be classified as music.Get Emancipated, or Die Tryin'"
1,Not really the McKinsey way,"This book claims to provide an insight into the skills and tactics that McKinsey consultants use. However, it rarely goes beyond generalities i.e. you would find some business concepts that business school grads (and many others) would be well aware of. Not really the McKinsey way."
2,Gold of the Blue Hummingbird,"Have you ever read a book that keeps you're attention from the start and when you finish the book, you close the book and say, ""Wow, that was a great book"". Well that's what Gold of the Blue Hummingbird is. The author created a great possibilities book through superstition, and not only a plausible but exciting novel in the process."
2,Davana - self-titled (Kemado),"From what I could tell, this self-titled debut from Portland's Davana, a four piece stoner rock / metal band is their first of two (so far) releases. Liked all five of these tracks, from the opener ""By The Mark"", the thirteen-minute ""Eyes Of Disguise"", ""Quiet Babies Astray In A Manger"" (vocals sound like old Black Sabbath), the guitar-driven riff-heavy ""Longdance"" and the ten-minute ""Maudie Shook"". Line-up: Dusty Sparkles-guitar, keyboards, synthesizer & vocals, Dell Blackwell-bass, Rockwell-synthesizer and Buck Rothy-drums. Just might draw in fans of Kyuss, Seompi, Monster Magnet, Witchcraft and Witchcraft."
1,Makes a great adventure boring and confusing.,"It's hard, but obviously not impossible, to make one of the great true adventure stories, the British Raj in Borneo, boring and confusing. Ms. Godshalk's rambling prose makes ""War and Peace"" look terse. Ms. Godshalk has a habit of writing a paragraph with twelve charactors and starting the next with ""he"" or ""she"". Most of your time is spent trying to figure out ""he"" who? In a book this size the charactors are surprisingly sketchy. Perhaps there is just too much trying to happen here."
1,Greatly disappointed,"The item is fine, but not the size ordered, and supplier refused to send correct item, as they had no control over their inventory. I ordered 3/4""Brass Floor Flange, 3/4"", but they sent 1"" (labeled as 3/4"") , which they claim they do not have. They did offer a refund, but the cost of return shipping made that unreasonable. With some effort, one can find a different supplier on the internet."
2,MASTERPIECE,"Since I purchased season one I have been hanging out to get my hands on season two 3,4,5 and 6?? It finally arrived this week and I have been religiously watching it after work each day. Ordinarily I prefer to play on the net, or read a book rather than watch TV. However Stargate has the uncanny ability to hold my attention.The true success of this show is it's ability to successfully mix several key elements into a coheasive mix. These being humour, action, plot, suspense, and consistency. ..."
1,cute at first but got boring,"I watched this as a child, it seemed to have been important to me back then, now I wonder why. I had a few chuckles, but there's not much variety in the plot. My kids even got bored, they still haven't gotten to disc 2. The actors worked well together, but every episode was pretty much the same."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU NEED TO USE CLIP!!!!,"So, I finally got around to hooking the Omron pedometer up to my computer and using it. Easy set up and seemed great in my pocket, but had to switch to the clip today. It's fallen off and been lost as very expensive yard art for someone within the first hour of use. DO NOT BUY this if you intend to use the clip. It's a horrible design with a weak spring and the pivot point is too low to sit snugly on the waist band. As much as I loved the pedometer I will never buy this again!!!!"
2,Nicely done.,"My kids and I watched this movie and not only the colors were so vivid and had a great quality picture, but the story itself was very charming. Very entertaining, fun and overall simply wonderful."
1,You get what you pay for,"I have always loved the quality of Oneida products, but this one although I know is good quality they are too light, thin, feel very inexpensive, I have bought for my daughters others sets that were much heavier and were much better quality, Oneida of course. well you get what you pay for, this one will do good for kids parties if you do not want to bring out the good stuffware."
1,"I have no idea what's goin' on here,","I kinda liked Jet when I heard their Cold Hard .... song. But personally, I don't like the fact that these guys are so banal ALL the TIME. I read an interview of them, and they sure seem to be lovin' the rock star style, with all their women and drugs. Well, good for you guys. But here's a tip. Next time, at least create music that deserves that lifestyle, and not the same song on every track. I seriously thought my player was skipping like mad, everything sounded regurgitated. All I'll give them is that they can play good (and that's mostly because the licks were borrowed from old masters.) But then again, I know 10 year olds that can play Stairway to Heaven. So try a little harder, guys, and maybe I'll have a listen, but for now, I think I'll stick to something a little more authentic."
1,euphoria,THIS cd is will bad . DEf leppard can do better than this . I can only hope that their next cd is a lot better than this one.
1,Trailers,I think there should be a law preventing trailers that depict a movie to be better than it really is. A total waste of money.
1,Too little for too much,I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it. The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos. It seems more like a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written.
1,This game is an abomination,"Completely unworthy of the Master of Orion title as this game is a slap in the face to the previous two games in this series, which both offer a far suprior playing experience. Forget about managing your planets, the new viceroy does that for you. Think you can control how your fleets in battle? Forget about that too. You just tell your ships who to attack now and they do the rest. And for that matter, the graphics on the space battles are 80s era. With this game, expect to just hit the turn button many times while the game for the most part plays itself. A complete waste of time and money."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I only paid a penny for it, and only one side of the tester works on batteries. I'm sure it's just a defective unit, but not worth pursuing any further."
1,Treasure Island,"Treasure Island, this classic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, is filled with literary devices and suspense that keep the reader interested until the end. This irresistable book is a must read for all people who love an extraodinary, intense, and action filled novel. This book was the worst book I read. ""Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol shots, and one loud groan, rang in my ears."" this magic three that was used in the story gives the reader and idea of what was going on through Jim Hawkins's eyes."
2,Chevy Vortec Wheel Cover,"Great Product, Protects the Steering Wheel finish, took some getting used to, I like the feel. Easy to install, just make sure you have it lined up before you put it on."
2,Great product,"This tiger was so soft and so big, it was definitely better than I thought it would be. Would tell anyone to buy it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Two of these were purchased for my kids to use during a long car trip. They had a great picture, decent sound and were easy for a 5 year old to use. However, before the end of the first movie, both devices stopped working. They would freeze and fail to load any other discs until you took out the disc in it, turned it off and unplugged it. Needless to say, I am quite disappointed with these devices, especially due to the frustration that it caused with my two young children during the trip. Do yourself a favor and buy a better known brand. This product is to good to be true."
2,I don't see any problems :),"My laptop's keyboard is kinda beat up, so I decided to get a different keyboard, one that I can sit back and relax without bothering my laptop.I only bought it yesterday, but it seems to work just fine. Yeah, the keys are a little loud, but I don't have a problem with it. It's kinda large, but it's definitely not heavy. I haven't had a problem with it yet, but like I said, I've only had it one day.One of the strange things I've encountered was the backspace button, but I quickly adjusted to it."

2,Fantastic.,"I am Pagan, and yet, this is the most moving soundtrack I have ever heard. It isn't about religion, is it? It's about family. It's about parents learning to let their children go, knowing they might let them fall but also knowing it has to happen for them to learn. The way that Father - AKA God - is just a parent, an angry parent trying to shield his children but not knowing how, really brings religion home. First off, I think every Christian should hear this musical. This is what I always thought Christianity should be: God isn't some big guy, he's a dad, end of story. Secondly, every parent and child should hear this, AKA everyone. This definetly made me appreciate the struggles I had with my own parents.""The hardest part of love is the letting go..."""
1,Disappointed. Should have listened to reviews.,"I bought these because it's hard to find the pods in the store and also, because they can be pricey. I read the positives and negatives and decide to purchage anyways. I found that the pods dont work. Water goes around them instead of through them, which is disappointing. We made sure there were no grounds around the edges and everything fits tightly together, however, after many attempts, we were still not successful. I may return this product or contact the sender."
1,Not as described,The dimensions of the product were not as described. The descriptions says the dimensions are 11.5 x 11.5 x 7 inches. The actual diameter was 8.5 inches and the actual depth was 5.5 inches. Spaghetti will clearly not fit in this pot and it was not what I wanted. I returned it without using it.
1,Just watch a preview - that's all there is,"I managed to watch 18 minutes before switching to 16x fast forward. Not fast enough. One of the most pointless movies ever, and a waste of good filmstock and a couple of otherwise decent actors."
1,a disgrace,"This is far from a railfan video. It celebrates a very dark period in New York Subway history,the late 1970's early 1980's when the thugs and vandals too over. It celebrates graffiti, which in reality is blatant vandalism. Thankfully you can visit New York today and ride subway trains virtually graffiti free, and see them for what they are, a true work of art."
2,Easy to use alarm clock,I got this alarm clock to replace one that was too bright at night. This is great. No frills and is a bit hard to see in very bright light during the day. But easy to see at night and you can dim it so that it doesn't interfere with sleep. Very happy with the purchase.
2,Worked just fine,"No problems to report. Plugged it in, it did its job and still doing it as I write this review! :)"
1,It would be a terrific CD if....,"This CD release if NOT the complete double-LP. A number of tracks were omitted. As such, I urge you to procede with caution, by checking the track list against the LP to determine if any of your favorite tracks were chopped."
2,satisfied,It was a gift. I have not heard any complaints. The merchant delivered it fast and it was packed well. I would buy from them again.
2,MENSA Logic Puzzle meets Board Game,"WOW! I love this game! There are a lot of great games out there these days, especially with the new European style games becoming more available in the US. Even amongst all these games, Ricochet Robot ranks up there as one my favorite games of all time. This is mental stimulation at its best!I have to admit that this game is not for everyone and I have a hard time finding people to play this game with due to its brain-draining nature. It does not have the strategic or tactical depth of chess, but it is on par for mental stimulation.The best way to describe this game is; a MENSA logic puzzle in a board game."
2,was not fond of the dancing,Parts of the book took me back to my early years and junior high school dances... not what I want to read about in a SciFi book. Other than that I enjoyed the story.
1,Crummy service,"The movie? I have no idea what the movie is like. The company, IMPORT CD's, sent me the wrong movie. I never watched the movie. I did not open it. I sent the WRONG movie back to the address that they listed. I have NOT been refunded my original money. Not happy with IMPORT CD's. Don't plan on ordering from them again, ever.Signed,Theren"
1,Baby is leaking all of the time!,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
1,Nice concept poor execution for multifunction capabilities,"Got this to use with an HP laser/fax/scanner multifunction printer to share between two computers. Don't waste your time with this unless all you want to do is use it strictly as a print server, no scanning. Just buy another multifunction printer and save yourself a lot of aggravation and time. Even though the printer I hooked it up to was listed as a supported printer, it would not work properly as a scanner on the remote computer. Plus you need to ""connect"" to the print server manually in order to scan even if you do get it working. Tech support was useless provided only rudimentary suggestions, as is typical, and was a further waste of time.On the other hand, Amazon provided exceptional service when I wanted to return it, and processed the return in record time."
1,"Good music, but wait a second","What we have here is a slick repackaging for Johnny Rodriguez's release from the early 1990's titled ""Run for the Boarder."" None of the songs here are the orginal hit recordings. While some of the songs have never been recorded before, the big named songs here are totally remakes.Now they are excellent remakes, and the new songs are excellent. But it gets a low rating simply because it is a cheap lie. Tryin to steal the money of country fans who aren't properly educated in the art of picking out good collections."
2,Great Game!!!!!,"This is a Wonderful game. not only is it fun, but you can learn a lot. I have also found that even a couple of my friends who are slightly younger than me have fun too. My parents like it too. So basically, it has levels of hardness for everyone but can go light on the smaller kids. My only concern is that in the future, me and my friends will run out of cards and get sick of the game. Overall, the game is a blast to play."
2,Still using these forms 7 years later!,These forms are extremely extremely useful to a photographer starting out. I've used them for about three different companies and recommend this book to all my assistants... Bravo!
2,Excellent! You've gotta see this!!,"I loved watching this DVD. I felt transported back to ancient times and as if history came alive in front of my eyes. I learned a lot more about the subject, was glued to the interviews and was absolutely blown away by the gorgeousness of the landscapes."
1,Horrible paint quality,"No problem with shipping and putting together, however, after approximately one month of placing them on our covered front porch the paint started to peel badly. If you sit in the chair and rest your arm, the paint particles stick to your skin. I can't believe this is happening when the chairs are brand new! The chairs were Christmas gifts from family out of town. I hope they don't see the chairs anytime soon as they already look about five years old!! How can I contact the company??????????"
1,DID NOT FLY,"GOT TO THE F.B.I, WARNING- THEN TO THE RATING PG 13-THE NOTHING!!! IM IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING BACK 4 CREDIT"
2,Basic,For the price it was great and served the purpose. It's very basic but light weight which made it great for trick-or-treat.
1,Parenthood Season 4,"I thoroughly dislike this show, but I've become addicted to it. However, the 7th episode of season 4 may have cured me because it was even more inane than usual."
1,Who cares?,"Who cares about a posh little who*e who doesn't like the way people look and tries to ""correct""them to her liking ? Who does she think she is?Alfred Einstein? this moviis for little runts and not for anyone who know realism from fantasy."
2,As honest as music will ever be.,"When you posess the talent that Townes Van Zandt obvioulsy does there is no need to add anything to it. This is about as bare as music gets. One microphone, one guitar and one great songwriter. This album offers music that is as pure and honest as anything commited to vinyl or tape or laser ever has been. Many of the Van Zandt standards are here and a few covers as well. This was recorded live in 1973 in a small club in Houston. All the atmosphere is there and the listener is drawn right into the middle of the evening. An excellant album from one of history's truly great songwriters."
2,Fabulous!,"I love this CD, I loved the movie as a child and the Soundtrack brings back great memories!"
2,wonderful vitamins for your immune system,"the vitamins are great, keep you healthy in any weather even when smb sneezes right near you-nothing."
1,Broken Item,"The rectangular plug that goes into the cel phone didn't work. One of the pins was noticeably cut in half (I compared it to the one that my phone brings) so I had to keep it pressed in with my hand for the phone to detect it.Also, the two ear buds were different sizes. Two stars because I ""suppose"" it would work ok had it come with everything intact and I did finally get it to work with a back-up plug I had."
2,wow,i bought this DVD not knowing anything about it but just on the recommendation of a friend. i really good movie along the lines of reservoir dogs.
1,just a box,My daughter was so happy to get this but when we pulled it out of the box it was just that a BOX - No cords etc..
1,A band that needs erasure,"I remember the conflicts between the fans of Depeche Mode and the fans of Erasure about which band was the best.The answer is tantalizingly simple. None of them were. They were both crap.Weirdly, both bands were created by the same person, Vince Clark. But then, Mr. Clark also formed two good bands, Yazoo (Yaz) and The Assembly.Thank goodness.As for Depeche Mode, their beat was recently pilfered by Lady Gaga. They used to be so famous. Now, their music is used as background by a crazy trannie doing euro-disco. Fitting punishment!PS. On balance, I think Erasure was better."
2,great blade,use on my little makita table saw. i no longer use the thin curf .this one makes a much nicer edge.
1,Never buying another pair of Levi's,"If you follow the care instructions as I did you cannot wear these out of the dryer. They look terrible. More wrinkles than a shower curtain...heck on a shower curtain at least the pleats are straight. Cannot straighten them had to super-hot steam iron repeatedly. For a pair of CASUAL jeans? That's more care than any of my formal slacks. And after a single wash, the label is already fraying and coming off. Awful quality for a premium price.Never getting another pair of Levi's. None of my other jeans wrinkled up this way. NONE."
2,Must see!!!,Great movie!!! Must see! Music CD will be the best!! Well done!!! Will become a great franchise!!
2,A Feel Good Movie....,"What a great film! Stars Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown. You keep a steady grin throughout the first half of the movie. From catching the bus to NYC, to going to class with young Flanagan, through looking for work on Wall Street, and then finally meeting Coughlin. Later, a 25-year old Shue appears. What a great young woman! She's smart, fun, good sense of humor, and of course, very pretty. Any guy would be lucky to meet her (Oh yeah, we find out later that she's an original ""rich chick"").You'll love the scenes of the old New York skyline and the beautifully breath-taking beaches of Jamaica, mon. A classic movie that everyone should watch and enjoy. Good songs and memorable quotes throughout as well."
1,Not what was paid for,"I loved the one glove I got - it was supposed to be a pack of 6 that my sister got me for my birthday - however, it turned out to be just one glove. While I wasn't initially disappointed, because I didn't know it was supposed to be 6 gloves, when I found out that I could have had a pink one, 2 in fact, and 3 more white ones, I thought that was a little WRONG. My sister, who lives several hundred miles away, was also quite upset, & I'm hoping by now that she got her money back!"
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Having heard such a lot about Russell Watson over the past year, I bought this new recording once it was released. Imagine my great disappointment when I discovered that the singing is bad. Actually, very bad! The sub-quality performances here certainly do not live up to all the hype heaped on the singer, which I now understand is just a marketing ploy and the words by die-hard but musically barely rational fans. I will not recommend this recording to others."
1,Ruined by an ending,"This movie was a reasonably entertaining comedy up until the last 5 minutes, nothing special but certainly not bad, then came the ending which made no sense and seemed tacked on. I would recommend skipping this one."
1,Sounds Good But Major Design Flaw,"I don't have audiophile expectations of a device that broadcasts radio frequency of mp3s. In spite of the limitations of the technologies, it sounds satisfactory. But, the folks at irock! really blew it with the on/off button. Positioned on the top of the unit is a 'soft-touch' button and red led indicator light/window. The indicator is impossible to see in daylight. And worse, I have not stored the unit in my car's console even once without it jostling around in there and activating the on button. Consequently, everytime I use it I must replace the two AAA batteries. They last a long time in normal play, but the position and sensitivity of the button is unacceptable. My Creative Labs Nomad III has a great feature for saving batteries - you must hold the on button down for a full 5 seconds to turn it on or off. irock! should take note . . ."
1,Does NOT work for my needs,"Given that this cable is aimed specifically at iOS device users, I assumed that it would work just fine on my iPhone 5. I received it in the mail just this afternoon and to my surprise, this cable doesn't charge my phone because it is a charging accessory that isn't supported. I've read other reviews and they state that it does work, however, not for me. Terrible, terrible product. Defeats the purpose. The only place I'm putting this cable is in the trash. And for the record, the female end of this cable isn't as portrayed in the image of the listing. It threw me off initially, so in essence, I didn't get what I paid for."
1,"Why so expensive, Amazon??","The quality of these melts are great. However, why is Amazon selling them for 3x the price they sell for at Michaels?? Amazon please fix the pricing for all of the Wilton candy melts. It appears you will have a lot of sales if the pricing is corrected- I know I certainly would be a regular buyer from you."
2,This is a great book!,"This book is the perfect guide for any kid who's entering the challenging years of junior high. The author handles difficult topics in a humorous and informative way. Plus, there's lots of advice from other kids who have already been there. So along with the pens, notebooks and lunch, slip a copy of this survival guide into your middle-grader's backpack."
1,"Cook's ""Abduction"" should have been--abducted, that is.","I didn't read Amazon's reader reviews on this book until afterward, but they all seemed to mirror my own assessment of ""Abduction"". My first thought was 'Did he write this in high school or what?'. This novel was definitely not up to Robin Cook standards in comparison to his many wonderful medical thrillers. His characters were nothing short of juvenile in behavior, and his overuse of the word ""surreal"" in one chapter had me about ready to scratch my own eyes out! I think Dr. Cook had better give up science fiction and go back to doctors and hospitals, where he excels as a novelist."
1,"poor quality, danger of shock or electrical fire","The Toastmaster 6431 does not have an Underwriters Lab label, which would make anyone hesitate before buying it. The Underwriters Lab endorsement (a ""UL"" logo) indicates that the electrical product is properly designed and constructed so that it is safe. We found the product online, where there was no info about the UL status of the product.The first thing that broke was the temperature control. We fixed that by oiling the screw whose in-out motion controls the heat setting.The more serious problems emerged when the fuse blew. We looked inside and discovered overheated wires with partially-melted insulation. This condition could cause both an electrical shock to the user and an electrical fire that could burn down a house.Toastmaster makes another hot plate (model TTS1) which does have an Underwriters Lab endorsement. We bought one today, and we hope that it will work safely until after the end of our kitchen remodelling project."
2,Great entertainment!,"My 18 month old son loves his Elmo's World Food, Water & Exercise DVD. They are short enough to keep his attention and are education as well. If your child enjoys Elmo, this DVD will be a hit."
1,Returned it,"I purchased it for a friend and she had already seen it so I returned it. Aside from that , she told me that it was kind of gossipy, rather than a study of her ballet story."
1,This Book is Dangerous,"I only give this book one star because I could not give it zero stars. This book was used for a class at Michigan State University in 2004. My daughter who has bipolar disorder discontinued taking her meds during the class which resulted in a 5-day psychiatric hospitalization for her. It is shocking that anyone with real knowledge of mental illness would publish such a book. My husband and I visited the professor after our daughter recovered (many months for a full recovery) and told our story. He promised to change his approach and tell future students that if they are taking medication and it's working, don't stop. This made us feel better, but it still troubles me that this book is out there and probably causing other people pain and heartache."
2,a real humidifier!!!,"I have tried different brand names including Crane and Vicks. If you have a humidity monitor at home, you will find that the Crane Penguin unit is really deceiving and does nothing more than a good-looking toy. Ironically, the unit still gets good reviews just because normally people won't bother to check the humidity level in their rooms. The Vicks does a better job in terms of increasing humidity. The Honeywell HCM-6009 is the best ever from my experience. It increase humidity quickly. If you have a big apartment and a house, this is the best choice."
2,Laugh out loud funny,"A great book and a fun jab in Americas ribs, especially during the Bush years. Some of the satire was a bit cliche but fun nonetheless."
2,A reader,An excellent concise review of material learned through a whole semester. I used it as my primary source in preparing for the CLEP in American Government. I passed the exam with ease. (I also used the Complete Idiot's Guide to American Goverment as a secondary source)
2,Red Ginseng,Only kind/brand I would buy. It has made an actually difference in my life. Try it --you will like it.
1,NOT TITO,"My favorite scene in this whole very bad movie was when all of John Travoltas cop buddies were killed and all he says is ""Not Tito?"" Who was Tito anyway? If for some strange reason that make a Face Off 2, I do beleive they should call it ""Not Tito 2"".The other big thing that annoyed me about this film, was how John Travoltas family touched each others faces. At first I would imagine it would be sweet, but after a while I would just have to say ""Stop Touching my face""."
2,Very Satisfying,"Like many of the books in Konemann's architectural series, this one offers copious quantities of beautiful photographs. The limited text is informative, intelligent and thankfully devoid of the quasi-theoretical nonsense that spoils so many architectural books. The critical architectural issues are explained but for the most part, the images are allowed to tell the story. Simplified, but effective plans and other diagrams complement the photos and text.In an age when so-called ""star"" architects do more talking than building, it is refreshing to see these monasteries, built with humility and a sense of aesthetic understanding that is so absent in the architectural profession today.I also recommend Lucien Herve's wonderful B+W photographs in ""The Architecture of Truth: Thonet Abbey"""
1,Absolute trash....an insult to the city of Chicago,"I watched this movie thinking it would live up to its billing. Instead, it was almost two hours of absolute, boring trash! I still can't believe this garbage won Best Picture. There's no way this film is better than the second installment of Lord of the Rings. Some critics hailed this movie as a wonderful return of the musical. That's hardly the case. If anything, this film is excrement in fancy wrapping. If you must see this movie, save yourself some money and rent it instead. It's too bad the copy I rented didn't have a self-destruct feature."
2,Good,"The best battery that you can ever find!if you simply calculate,you wil understand that it's cheaper than Alkaline!"
1,Not worth it.,"Once again, Intuit is asking Mac users to pay MORE for less. Quicken 2007 has fewer features than the Windows version, a much less sophistacted interface, gives the user far less information. All this for a much higher price tag. Other software companies give you comparable versions at the same price. Hopefully somebody will develop competitive financial software that will give Intuit a run for its $$$."
1,"Neat idea, but not good for strong chewers.",My dog had this for 30 minutes before he chewed through the knot. He then went on to chewing the rubber off the nozzle. My dog was 9mo old and weighed 26lbs. Loved the idea of it. Disappointed that I spent $12 on a toy that lasted less then an hour.
2,Great little camera...,"I bought it as a first digital camera, checking out the terrain before making a big investment. My friends are ohing and ahing over the pictures I took in Rio with this thing (of course, you don't need a great camera to get great pictures in Rio!). It travels well, eats batteries more than I expected, is easy to use, takes a little while to warm up when first switched on, and lives up to the positive reviews I've read here and on the web...Buy a 128M memory card and rechargable batteries, and enjoy. There's a waterproof case available, something I'll buy if I can find a discount as I'm an avid SCUBA diver and snow-skier (the kind of skier who would need a waterproof case). I was disappointed with my order - Amazon listed a coupon for a reduced-price memory card but the web site wouldn't let me apply it to my order - but I'm not disappointed with the camera. Enjoy!"
1,worst game I'f ever played,"The game is not fun at all, It's impossible to control Barbie and her horse,the first level is sooooo easy, I don't think that you can make the level without winning 1st place. Anyway the next level is ok, the 3rd level gets harder,but the 4th race is very difficult it's impossible to control her. But the worst things are that you don't have enpugh time, barbie never goes into the direction you tell her to go, and if you wanna jump over something you have to hold on to the control pat and press B at the same time.P.S.: WARNING: Don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!"
2,It's an awsome book,I recomend this book to any girl 12-20 and her mother because its a good book that can make you feel pretty inside and out. also its not racest 'cause it has chapters on differnt beauty tips for differnt races. It's way worth the [price]!
1,very so-so imitation of Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66,"Gimmicks was a Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 cover band from Sweden. Their first album was in Swedish, their second album (this one) was the same tracks rerecorded in English. The track list (as listed on the CD) is:1. The Joker2. Walk On By3. California My Way4. Look Of Love5. Constant Rain (Chove Chuva)6. Boink (Brazil de Carnival)7. Bom Bom Bay8. Going Out Of My Head9. Look Around10. Dance The Samba11. You're My World12. RodaAs you can see, only some of the tracks are one that Brasil '66 did. (This is somewhat analogous to the way Tijuana Brass cover groups like the Mexicali Brass did their albums.)But in my opinion, since the group has lackluster arrangements and performances compared to Brasil '66, it's not even worth a high import price to hear these other tracks ""as they might have sounded"" had Brasil '66 done them. Better to spend your money on real Brasil '66 albums and/or actual Brasilian artists."
2,Beautiful Deck,This is a truly beautiful deck that clicks instantly for interpetation. I love it. Uses a bit of pre RWS symbolism which is always refreshing nowadays. The book is concise and interesting.
2,ALOT OF GOOD INFORMATION,A GOOD BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND WILL CHOOSE TO BE LED BY THE LORD TO VICTORY!
2,"Good, But Dated","What struck me in reading this in 2012 is how far the United States has come. The Clinton years (even to this 32-year old) seem like ancient history and the protests during the Vietnam War seem like ancient, ancient history. The country has come so far.This book does serve its purpose, however, in highlighting the environment in which the President grew up, came into his own, and grew intellectually. The work is obviously dated given that it only goes to his decision to run for the presidency in 1992, but the early chapters are strong and compelling and read almost like a novel."
1,Should have done a better job,"Although this is atop the list as one of the finest westerns ever, I was very disappointed at the overall quality of the dvd. There are some definite rough spots, pauses, and glitches as well as an average audio track. I am among a group af true Kinski fans and while I enjoyed the dvd and REALLY liked the fact that they had the alternate ending (is it Klaus or isn't it?) of the film along with some nice extra features, we feel more attention should have been paid to doing a more professional job of digitally mastering the film. It deserved better. Don't let it stop you from buying it. Although at 25 dollars it is definitely over-priced, it is hightly unlikely that anyone will go to the trouble of doing a better job on the mastering. All things being equal, this is the best available version around. But a five star movie deserves better than a 1 star digital mastering."
2,Great for inspectors with minimal experience,Takes an approach that develops knowledge and understanding for inspectors and engineers with minimal to medium experience. Need to give more emphasis on building construction (small and medium size buildings).
2,Amazing,"We have an eight-year-old Bosch dishwasher. The stainless steel inside of dishwasher become stained with soap and spot rinse residue. Normal cleaning with soap and water never completely remove the residue it would always reappear after the next wash cycle. I saw an advertisement on TV for a dishwasher cleaner and thought why not give it a try.The directions were easy to follow. Open the lid on the bottle, place the bottle upside down in the silverware basket, close the dishwasher and run the machines on the hottest cycle which is usually the pots and pans setting. I didn't believe it would clean the inside of the dishwasher. To my amazement, it looks brand new.I tell people how dishwasher magic can make their dishwasher look brand-new. Buy it today and prove to yourself it actually works."
1,its a bore,"i am star wars fan.this book [...].it is very boring.if you are a star wars fan,you already know all the stuff in the book.it will collect dust in your room.david west donalds is weird to write this book.you will get no info from this book.do not waste your 15 dollars.buy somthing like the star wars triligy collection.it is very good.there are many star wars books out there.please do not waste your $$$$$$$$."
2,WWF wrestlemania 2000,This game will never get boring you can play it for hours at a time. The road to wresltemania is so fun and you can so that with so many different people. If you like wrestleing you have to get this game
1,3rd dead one,"I got a B70 for Xmas and it kept shutting off on its own, so I returned it for another B70. It had the same problem. Then I found all the reviews that said the B70 was defective, so I tried the B60. Same problem again, it won't brew unless I take out the water reservoir and put it back in. Repeat process for each cup you want to brew. The auto turn on feature doesn't work because of this, so don't expect a hassle free cup of coffee in the morning. Definitely not worth it."
2,Things are starting to pick up,"This was similar to the first volume. Now however, the TA's have fought in real battle and there has been more action than the first volume- slowly things are coming together. Volume 3 is when you'll decide if you like the series or not though- There is a lot more action and more character development than the first 2 volumes. Although Volumes 1 and 2 seem slow, it is important for a basis for the rest of the series so bear through it! Again, I recommend you rent the first 3 volumes before buying them to decided whether or not you'll like the series. I really enjoyed this series and it took the first 3 volumes to figure that out."
2,Netgear Wireless Router,I love it this router came earlier than expected all I had to do was plug it up. Nothing complicated no ridiculous software to install and I was wireless. I saved over $30.00 buying this online verses purchasing this in the store. Great delivery time and awesome product. Customer satisfaction!!!! A+
2,Here it is!,"Very well made and attractive enough for company. I'm trying to do my part by buying natural products like bamboo and this set shows you how far ""green"" has come. I don't like salt mills but do you know how hard it is to find a pepper mill with a salt SHAKER? Hard. I know. I looked. Well, here it is!"
1,"Negative, one-sided, unforgiving","Noble provides a wealth of information about good nutrition, birthing practices, and the risks of multiple pregnancy. The problem is that the factual evidence is smothered in a heavy handed, one-sided viewpoint that seems to originate from the fascist regime of down-with-all-modern-medicine. This is my second pregnancy, and I recently found out that I'm carrying twins. I was interested in the possibility of a vagnial birth with minimal intervention, but I'm more shaken than encouraged by Noble's stance on the evils of c-sections and other possible complications. This book was NOT the one I needed to help me discern what was best in the upcoming months.The nutrition information had a solid core, but Noble pushed the envelope with her own agenda of anti-dairy pro-vegan diets. This would have been much better received and better understood had it less of a screaming banshee tone.Good luck, and you might want to find a different book."
1,Horrible.,"This book contains more mis-statements, or just plain lies, than anything I have read in a long, long time. Poorly written, full of nonsense and boorish. Wasserman was definitely smoking something when he tried to write this! I am amazed this was ever published."
2,Awesome Deal,"I was worried when I took it out of the package and felt how light it was, but I was impressed with how strong it was. Fit right in to the gap in the dash and holds the cd player securely. Much cheaper on here than in store anywhere. Cant beat that! I reccommend this to anyone!"
1,Attention Ce CD est une erreur,"Pour le prix de $23.99 ce CD ne vaut pas la peine car il ne contient pas le CD Live In Anaheim mme si il est mentionner a l'endos du CD. Tres,tres,décevant"
2,grew on me,"Got this album when it first came out. Feel it's a pretty good mix of the ""old school"" stuff from the first two records. Not as dance-oriented as the first, but not as pop as the second. It's somewhere in the middle.This production isn't too much, so his amazing vocals really stand out. Writing it pretty strong. Not his best, but not bad. I'm holding him to a pretty high level, by the way. This would be a 5-star record for most people.This is one of the better Seal records. I recommend it."
1,Stinks,"No way to attach this to an office chair, needs a bungie cord or something. Might work in the car, but it's just not large enough to really make any kind of a difference in comfort, unless you want it for your butt."
1,Song not on CD,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the ""songs with lyrics"" in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here! I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie. Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called ""Send Me On My Way"" by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album ""When I Woke"". Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it. Hope this helps those looking for this song."
1,Terrible quality,"Smartwool's cable socks are the worst socks I've ever bought. Both heels developed holes the first week that I wore them. Unlike every other Smartwool sock I've owned, the cable socks are paper thin and do not insulate."
1,GARBAGE,"This racket fell apart within five minutes! The grip tape unravelled and the cone shaped piece that goes from grip to neck came loose, sliding up and down.. but the worst part is that the strings are so weak that the shuttlecock gets stuck between them instead of bouncing off. This happened to not just one but FOUR of these before we had a chance to even warm up! PASS ON THIS BRAND!"
2,The right book at the right time.,"I am into my 25th year at the same company, doing a job that I have always loved, but my star is a little tarnished with age. I needed a boost. The last thing I want to do is end my career with a heavy sigh. Mr. Kelley took me back to the beginning when it was all fresh, exciting and I couldn't wait to climb the next mountain. It's a book I will read again. I've also ordered copies for my supervisory staff, I hope they too can benefit from these words of wisdom."
1,Not worth the bother.,"I got this to put in the bottom pool of my fountain. The instructions and illustration were not all that helpful so called number providid to clarify. It ended up being a pain to hook up as the cord from light to all the other parts was too short so the placement was not what I wanted. Additionally, it only worked for 3 nights. Not happy with this product at all."
1,I Wish Zero Stars Was an Option....,"I am a huge fan of the Lynley series, both novels and tv series. Some of the books in the series have been so-so or weak but others would make it up for it. I hit this novel in the series while on a trip to the UK over the holiday and ""saved"" starting this novel for the long flight. HUGE MISTAKE. What Came Before He Shot Her is just horrible. It is just a self-indulgent exercise on the part of the author and provides nothing of value for Lynley fans. It was fine to get the backstory of the person responsible for the murder of Helen Lynley. However, it is all stereotypical. If you know anything about today's troubled youth, you could pretty much accurately imagine this backstory yourself. If you are a fan of the series, just skip this one. Read a short synopsis if you want to know the young killer's story but don't waste your time with the book."
2,Beautiful,"Many selections are new, and as always, John Rutter's music is magnificent. I play it before going to bed so I can 'hear' the details without being distracted by things around me."
2,Still the Best,"I own the previous edition too, and, while this book has gotten huge, that's more the fault of Sun than O'Reilly. As a (reluctant) Java programmer, I use this book nearly everyday. You'll become familiar with the classes you use all the time, but at some point you'll want to use some obscure class you've never touched and your Nutshell book will be there for you. If you program in Java, buy this book."
2,Pretty good product,I bought two of these to keep my one year old away from things. One is around the Christmas tree and the other I split into two sections to keep her away from the fireplace and my records (she loved to wave them around and put them all on the floor). I anchored them to the wall so they stay in place well. She likes to throw her toys over them sometimes but other than that she ignores them. They do a great job of keeping her away from things. I wouldn't use them to put her in because I like to let her have the run of the house except for the areas she shouldn't get into. They aren't very nice looking but they work well for what I'm using them for.
2,AYURVEDIC KING,"This book is a must have if your're studying Ayurveda Medicine. It is easy to read and comprehend, thereby giving you more insight into the world of ayurvedic treatments and principles."
2,Solid Read Overall,"I thought that this book was good overall. Sure, you can definitlely spot many similarities between Eragon and other very popular fantasy novels. But what is the problem in that? Taking an approach that has been sucessful is smart, and the book shouldn't be degraded for that. While the characters may not have been quite as personal as in books such as in the Dragonriders of Pern series, I thought that he did a decent job creating his main characters. The most important aspect of a book to me is that its plot is exciting, and makes me WANT to keep reading, and Eragon did that. The only thing I really had an issue with was the sometimes apparent predictibility of the novel (ie, he's going to be attacked right... now.)But overall, a solid book. I enjoyed reading it."
2,Great item,"I had one of those big, colapsable, bonnet shades that attach to the stroller and hated it. this is great! It shades my son while still allowing him to see the world go by. It also protects him nicely when it is windy out.they make a version for the bugaboo too, but no need to get it; you can make this work very easily on that stroller too."
2,Couldn't put it down,"I don't know why I'm so obsessed with the Laci Peterson murder. Maybe it is because she was someone that was so normal and easy to relate. I found this book to be a thorough account of the events starting with December 24, 2002. It was a page turner and impossible to put down. Page after page I kept being shocked at the lies after lies that Scott said time after time. Many components you've heard about in the news, but there are others - transcripts of conversations between Sharon Rocha and Scott Peterson that were new to me. There are a few typos that show the book was a rush to press - especially towards the end of the book, but it is a riviting story none the less."
1,Dreadful Mishmash,I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky. This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere. Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows. This is my last Cromwell.
2,It's Disneyland at home!,"I bought this game for myself, I'm a Disneyland nut! We go at least once a year, so this is great to fill in the time between visits. We play as a family, we love it. My kids are 6 and 3, they really get into the game. It helps get your kids involved in planning and thinking ahead. Although many of the rides are not in the same places as they are at Disneyland. The goal of the game is to go to all your attractions and get back to the front gate 1st. It's a great game for the family and for Disney lovers of all ages. A great way to spend family time, even if you are not at Disneyland."
2,Sleeping Ugly.,"I liked this book because the prince kissed the right girl.I also liked this book because it had a happy ending. Miserella is very beautiful on the outside, but she's ugly, ugly, ugly on the inside! Plain Jane has a name to fit what she looks like. She has a crooked nose and teeth and her hair is short and messy. But Jane is very kind and beautiful on the inside. Which one do you think the prince chose?This book reminded me os Sleeping Beauty because it was based on that book. If you like retold fairy tales you'll like Sleeping Ugly!"
2,Requires effort to employ...like anythiing else,"I liked this book. It will not solve all of your life's problems, or make you an instant success. But, it provides useful information derived from polls, interviews and a lot of refining that helps you to realize that if you are to succeed, you need to do what you do best and ""manage"" your weaknesses. This can be accomplished through a solid staff that complement one another with their strengths. If it's not good for anything else, it sheds light on other peoples' tendencies and their root causes. I gave the book four instead of five stars because a few more ""how should you use this everyday"" examples would have been helpful. But, again, if you expect to get anything from the book, you should plan to work."
2,"Wild, Wacky and too camp for words!","Good-looking people populate this fast paced SCI-FI farce. The fashions are still relevant 16 years later. I loved this movie when I first saw in Honolulu in 1984. Hope you enjoy this as much as my wife and I didAs a Systems Engineer working for national intelligence agencies and now a defense contractor I loved the lampooning of our industry. I swear I work for YoYodyne! I viewed with interest the movie's portrayal of the cutting edge computer systems of the day that were all text-based screens. Indeed we have come a long way with Motif, x-Windows and (dare I say it/) MS NT.Regards, jd"
2,Not Kings X but...,If you liked Poundhound you'll like Supershine (both Doug Pinnick solo vehicles). The latter is heavier and more complex but less melodic. Thankfully Doug doesnt feel like he has to play guitar on this one and gratefully he sticks to bass. Its tasty in parts and should satisfy hardcore Kings X fans like me...however it is not Kings X. One listen should give you a real appreciation of Ty Tabors contributiion to the band when you hear this album. I am always suprised at the lack of funk influence on Dougs solo stuff. I expect to hear some of Tapehead on his solo albums but alas he stives for thunderous crunching straight ahead neometal. And thats ok. Hey its only rock and roll...but I like it.
2,Great case!,"Well made bag, fits more than it look like it is able to. It is well made and a nice quality. No one can touch this price."
1,Las Canciones Son Malas,"I'm not sure what's worse: The CD sound quality or the songs themselves. I'll give it to the songs - at least you'll remember the wretched CD sound quality; the songs are formulaic and forgettable. Whatever spark of creativity the Outlaws rediscovered on their previous release (Ghost Riders) had abandoned them for this effort.One wonders how ""Running"" and ""Easy Does It"" (the only tracks here that are even vaguely interesting) might have sounded in the hands of the original band."
1,Better luck next time,"Hey, I'm an H.P. Lovecraft reader, and my expectations are high. I'm always hopeful when the title of a movie `says' the film is inspired by HLP. But . . .The writer/director was really--really trying, but he lost control from the beginning. The film began with a series of disjoined images and dialogue which were startling, but there was no suspenseful build up.Okay, it's difficult to put Lovecraft on the big screen anyway, but the stilted dialogue didn't help. The range of acting ability was uneven, and that didn't help. Also, using black and white, well, why? B&W; can be used to build a great mood and suspense but this film had neither so using B&W; footage was pointless. And the blood and gore just for the sake of it . . . better luck next time.If you want to watch Lovecraft on film, rent the `Resurrected' with Chris Sarandon or go back to `Re-Animator.'"
2,Great Fun!!!!!!!!!,"A&E is excellent when it comes to making mini-series, and Tom Jones is a prime example. The characters were very well cast and the screenplay was very well written. It was a joy to watch. I enjoyed every minute. Max Beesley was amazing as Tom and Samantha Morton did a wonderful job of portraying Sophie. There is nothing more to say other than, it was one of A&E's finest."
2,inspiring,"For anyone who likes Guideposts magazine, this book is a wonderful compilation of some of the best stories.I would highly recommend this book."
2,"Hate Xmas, love this album!",MU330 makes the holidays so much more fun with this album! Love their version of Angels We Have Heard On High as well as their own songs like This Year More Than Ever. MU300 fans (like me) are sure to love it.
2,Great!,"Great product, very durable! I am very happy with this. it was just what i needed. I highly recommend to anyone."
2,Spectacular book!!!,"I learned so much from this book! And I have gone to college and studied homeopathy extensively for a whole year before. But this book is so beautifully written that it is easy to understand the subject and follow the suggestions. It has GREATLY helped my cat and me, his guardian. A big thank you to the author!"
1,disappointed,The blue dial is really a lot closer to black. Not as attractive as the picture online. I returned it.
2,Monster Turbine High - In ear speaker,"These Monster Turbine High Performance in ear speakers are truly remarkable the detail to every note and excellent bass response is unequaled. The only thing I've heard that comes close to these ear buds are electrostatic head phone - bought a used pair on ebay and they were not cheap! I think they lasted about 2 months. My hat is off to Mr. Monster, Thank you. Buy a pair today if the music you like to listen to means anything!!!!!!!!"
1,"Anti-breastfeeding, pro-consumerism","What a bunch of hogwash. This magazine promotes rampant consumerism, and it's absolute worst stance is that you can ""simplify"" your life by not breastfeeding your newborn. Breastfeeding is the most simple and rewarding of acts that a mother can engage in. As a full time working mom, I never found breastfeeding to be a bother or chore. Worse, is Real Simples' response to reader's critics of this article, from which one sample is ""But one thing is for certain: it is never appropriate to breast-feed in public expecially on the subway. ""What? It is never appropriate to breast-feed in public? A mother's right to breastfeed in public is protected BY LAW in most states. Get real."
2,Great read,Great read with good advice. Would recommend to expecting women in the third trimester. Fast-paced and didn't take me long to get through.
1,Dull,"I guess this book was kinda interesting. It just seemd to drag on and go deep into FBI procedures and not so much into the everyday life of a gangster. Compared to other Mafia books I've read this is by far the worst. But it is still a mafia book, so I found it to be at least somewhat interesting. I would not recommend this book unless you are more interested in how the FBI fought organized crime, and not the everday operations of a mafia family."
1,Another Dissappointment,"I was very dissappointed after completing Pimsluer's ""Quick and Simple Egyptian Arabic."" The set includes 4 compact disks with 8 30-minute lessons. However, about 10 minutes of each lesson is a review of the previous lesson with a couple of new words introduced. Review is always good, and it's the only way to learn a language, but couldn't one just rewind the tape? I feel like I only learned about 10 words. In truth, I probably learned about 60, so that works out to about 33 cents per word since I paid $20.00 for it. The disks don't teach anything about grammar, tenses, and writing, of course. I don't even feel like I've sratched the surface of the language. Perhaps I should have purchased the Egyptian Arabic I audio, but it is extremely expensive. In short, if you are looking to learn Arabic, I'm sure you could find something less expensive and more worth your time."
1,Works- sort of,"I got an Opteka T-mount to adapt a reflective telephoto lens for my Canon. It arrived with the lens and seemed fine, sturdy and well fitted. While it worked properly at first, after a couple of days the inner threaded sleeve came loose from the outer housing, allowing the lens to rotate freely and wobble a bit. It still holds the lens on the camera but makes the lens unreliable; I've ordered a replacement (from a different vendor) that hopefully will hold together."
1,THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters lacked substance. They were very crass and frankly quite dumb. I also felt that Ms. Henley was trying to copy a story I read by Connie Mason called ""THE LION'S BRIDE"",which was a beautiful story."
1,Its not the end...,"I dont know what to say.. but I think that after so much success and so much greatness in his music, this time Di Blasio didnt do what I have been excpecting for years now... The music that put in my life the taste of optimism such as ""Solo"", ""Corazon De Ninio"", "" Barroco"", ""Andino"", ""Penelope""... and all of the previous, is not found in one single track! Please go back to your style Di Blasio... its been years I havent listned to anything but Di Blasio's music! Raul's music will always be an inspiration for me..."
2,Colchoneta inflable 2,"Bien cómoda, buena relacion precio valor, vale la pena, suficientemente resistente a los pinchazos por lo que se puede usar en la playa"
2,Top Notch Fantasy,"Hercules and the Amazon Women can be said to have everything, action, humor, romance, and a great cast ranging from Kevin Sorbo and Anthony Quinn to Roma Dowmey. If you love the Hercules T.V. show, check this one out! also keep a look out for Lucy Lawless in a role before Xena."
2,Baby won't sleep without this!,"I started using this after my daughter was swaddled,,, she is now 13 1/2 months old and will not sleep without this! She likes it to be dark so she's stretched the neck so she can pull it up to her eyes. I've tried several times to let her sleep without and it and she won't! I'm buying more!!"
2,Wonderful for a classroom,"Mr. Eishen's book is entertaining and historically factual. A lot of research has obviously gone into this novel. This book challenges ""Killer Angels"" as an equally respectable and educational novel that could be read in jr. highs and middle schools throughout the nation. This novel is hard to put down because it draws you into the action and doesn't let you go. I would love to see this book on future reading lists for schools."
2,Makes You Think of 1985,"I was at a concert last night in Berkley, CA and at the GreekTheater, Mark Knopfler played all 4 of these classics, So FarAway, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, & Brothers in Arms. Otherthan that, he played Telegraph Road. Very good. Anyway, this isa good album! Maybe a little not as good as either Making Movies,or Love over Gold. All these songs are pretty good!! I think theMoney for Nothing on here I think is done really well and I liketo repeat it over N' over again. Sometimes 3 when even better.Also, check out Your Last Trick, Why Worry, Ride Across the River, The Mans Too Strong, and One World."
1,this book is a joke right?,"unbelievable ! This book advocates eating raw meat, full cream butter/milk, lots of fatty dairy products. It belongs to a time when men where men and women cooked in the kitchen. And real men hunted and killed their own meat. There have been numerous studies linking the kind of diet this book recommends to bad health. If you want a proper book on eating backed up with proper scientific studies then I would highly recommend 'The China Study' by Dr. T. Colin Campbell. What are the author's credentials anyway, is she a nutritionist? NO, is she a Doctor? NO, is she perhaps a research scientist? NO."
1,"Good dialogue, undeveloped plot","I have read several of the Spenser books. This one started very promisingly, with witty dialogue and an interesting background. But about halfway through the book, the plot gave out. Spenser gets a lucky (too lucky) break when he spots a certain photograph, but the thread it offers to unravel the mystery is only minimally drawn out. The murdered woman remains a cipher to the end, her secrets barely unveiled. Too many secondary characters are mere page-filling red herrings (the sexy secretary, the sexy Southern detective, the overaggressive teenager). The murderer eventually just confesses his/her guilt to a passive Spenser. And, worst of all, at the last moment, to create the illusion of closure, the author invents a new, unrelated crime, both nameless and motivationless, so that Spenser can have one of the suspects arrested in a sham climax. A good premise gone nowhere."
2,VERY UNIQUE,I'm a barbie doll colector and when i saw this barbie i was so mezmerised. I couldn't decide which fairy to buy till i bough this one it's so Beautiful. i loved it
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is utter garbage. The acting, the dialog, all of it is horrible. I am going to give this movie away to the first sucker I see. Do not waste your time and especially don't waste your money on this trash."
2,Pretty good deck,Well this deck is ok.I like the yugi deck the most.I got all the starter decks.I got some good dragons!The joey deck has its ups and downs.I like his red eyes black dragon.I like the thousand dragon too.The really good card I like from it is polmeryization (I prolly spelled wrong :p )
1,Generally Poor Selection and Poor Quality,"There are several tunes that sounded like scratchy records. Some tunes were not hits or were hits by other artists. Some of the artists never had a hit.I found the following tunes worth taking: Oh Lonesome Me, Little Town Flirt, This I Swear, A Teenager in Love, and Denise.I don't know why people go to the trouble to produce a CD like this. They could have at least edited out the record noise.FYI: I am a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay."
2,YES,"Not exactly a naturally smelling lemon aroma, but at least this one doesn't make me feel bad; whereas others have. And if you are vacuuming pet hair, it helps quite a bit."
1,poorly researched,"Have read a lot of the reviews of this book, and no one seems to notice how disappointing the flashbacks are. Grafton has not done her homework! 1)Little houses, even the newer ones, did not have showers in 1953; only wealthy people had such luxuries, we ordinary folk had bathtubs, only. 2)Television sets could not be carried into the schools for all the kids to watch; they were much too large and too heavy, besides they had to be hooked up to an antenna on the roof! Schools didn't have such things in 1953 (I went to school in Calif around that time.) 3)Don't get your ""panties (or undies) in a wad"" was not colloquial phrase in those days. It is much more recent. There are lots of other ""gaffes"" but those three stand out. Reading the book became a hunt for mistakes instead of a good story read."
2,"Wow, this CD cooks, with gas.","What can I say about this recording that one listen will not explain. I was into'd to Keith later in his career with the self titled ""Keith Sweat"". Since then I have been all over the map. Next ""Still in the Game"", then ""Get up on It"" now his first recording. To be honest I was into more aggressive music but that was then, now my aggression is getting busy, period.All of Keith's work is at or near the top of the RB game. Considering this was his first effort was it any wonder that he is today at the top?My favorite songs on this recording are ""Rain"" and ""Make it last forever"" also ""sumthin sumthin, sumthin sumthin just ain't right"" I heard ""Something"" recently on KBLX here in SF.Get this CD. Regardless of how you try to classify his stuff quality never gets tired."
1,Whats The Authority Here?,"I must say Bill here is a whole lot more polished than Rick. There are some Wonderfully insightful tools in this book. Unfortunately, the Authority here is not Scripture. Ministry Experience is the Authority. Calling this ""new wave"" the work of the Holy Spirit is Diceptive. You Cannot seperate the Holy Spirit from the Scriptures. They do not work seperately or contradict each other. But, you don't have to take my word for it. Just be a Berean."
2,saves the day just cant slow down.,"this cd is amazing. the chord progression and the emotion blew me away when i got this. the songs are just beautiful, and its truely a shame they have wandered from this original sound as much as they have."
2,The best I ever had,"I have owned the Caruso roller system for over 25 years. I bought the first set they had with the salt. Yes, I was shocked once by the old ones one time. Not a pleasant feeling. I purchased the saltless system about 10 years ago. It's nice not having to add the salt. I have used these on every kind of hair. In fact I just used them on my niece who has the worst hair. She's 12 and was so embarrassed by her hair she kept it in a bun on top of her head. Well, I used my rollers to style her hair for my sisters wedding and she begged me for my roller set. Her hair never looked better. Everyone that saw her wanted to know how she ""fixed"" her hair. Needless to say I just ordered her a set of her own. I've now bought 5 sets. I'll be a user for life."
1,mediocrity from a good musician,"Having heard Wolf in NYC play these songs, I thought I would like the album but the recording focuses too much on the vocals (not his biggest asset) and too little on the jazz-fusion of the live performance. Use your money to go see him live, forget the CD."
1,I have to give this a star?,"I bought this mop and returned it after its first use. The mop head popped off multiple times in the midst of mopping after securing it properly. The engineer in the house interjected a second opinion said it didn't look very functional either. Thank you, Bed, Bath and Beyond for making the return painless."
1,not very good at all,not sure what the point of this book was ... not enough details were included to make it at all interesting
2,The very best!,"You like Nana Mouskouri? You've never heard her sing until you get your hands on this 2-CD album. Recorded in 1984, with songs in Greek, English and French (some of the languages in which Nana sings flawlessly, without a hint of accent), at the ancient 1st century A.D. Herod Atticus at the foothills of the Acropolis, this CD is pure magic. Amazing Grace is my favorite track, and it's simply breathtaking... I've given this CD as a gift to several friends, and they're always simply delighted!"
1,Not a Novel Novel.,"I really wanted to like this book. To my surprise it took me three attempts to finish, I was that bored. I tried to give it yet another chance by listening to the audio version, but the result was sadly the same: I found little in terms of the characters, their shared experiences during China's cultural revolution and the author's message on the transcendent power of literature that was new or refreshing."
1,Missing one of the greatest Mets games ever??????,"OK, so I wasn't around in 1969, but how can you leave out that gameAnd what the heck is that game with Mets and Yankees where Wright hit a walk off? That game is barely memorable. In fact, I had to look it up to see what game they are actually showing on this DVD.against Atlanta where the Mets scored 10 runs in the bottom of the eighth capped off by a Piazza 3-run home run? June 30, 2000. That was definitely the most memorable game for me. Shea was ROCKIN that inning. And this was in the midst of the hated rivalry between the Mets and Braves. The days of Rocker and Chipper. And this was the day after Rocker's return to Shea after making his racist comments.I was going to buy this DVD set until I found out this game was not featured. Any mets fan knows exactly what game I'm talking about. At least I still have it on VHS."
1,LESS than 1 star,"Absolutely horrible taste. It tastes like chemicals. No idea how this got so many good reviews, unless these people are putting a lot of bananas, ice cream, or other things into their protein shake. I mix mine with milk or water, and this is the worst protein I've ever tasted."
2,"i would give it 12 stars, but 5 is as high as this goes","i first discovered spineshank about 3 years ago when i saw the video for synthetic. i'll admit that i didn't think too much of it then, but when i bought the cd--height of callousness-- last summer (yeah took me long enough, huh?) it instantly blew my mind! then, recently i heard that spineshank had come out with a new album. i bought it the first time i saw it in the store. i was so impressed, i hardly ever listen to anything else now! this album is a massive improvement on the last one. the last one focused more on screaming and on this one the band combines the most perfect mixture of screaming and singing that i have ever heard. the vocals blend perfectly with the music as well. there are few bands good enough out there that can produce a cd that you can listen to from start to finish and want to do it again. spineshank did an outstanding job with this album. (buy the height of callousness as well)"
2,Best book,"I read constantly and obsessively, and this is my favorite book of all time. My son is even named Owen."
1,NOT Recomended,"When used on beards it has a tendency to pull hairs. It's not a very strong shaver, and battery only lasts about six months and then will not hold a charge. Mine went in the recycle bin. I will not buy another Conair."
1,If you want to get bored...,"Maybe I'm ignorant about electronic music, but I've heard a lot of symphonic rock and new age, and I can hardly denominate ""music"" to this CD. Poor recording quality adds to what is a mistake in my collection."
1,Leaking,"Like some others, I had a leaking problem on install. It doesn't seem to be a great design, the parts don't seem to quite line up correctly. After playing with it for a while I did manage to get it to work with only a very minimal leak, but after reading some other reviews here I might go back and try some of their ideas. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone though, a shower-head should be a very easy thing to install without any problems like this one seems to have. I'm no expert but I've installed shower heads, faucets, toilets, kitchen sinks and a few other things around the house, this one should have been a 5 minute job."
1,Barf!,"I saw this on the Disney channel, hoping it would be better than Joke-a-lot. Actually, it's worse than j-a-l. The voices and anamation make you wanna puke and the care bear rejects wish bear wishes over are stupid old jerks!"
1,DON'T BUY,"The title of this book disguises the fact that it is not a scholarly work and is heavy on opinion. There are no foot notes or end notes and the Author does not support his case with any primary or secondary references.I do not recommend this book for any serious student of Military Science, Political Science or Military HistoryTerry Tucker, US Army, SGM Ret; Adjunct Professor Military Science/History"
2,Very informative,This book is excellent. It presents a very good overview of how to run a small corporation in a manner that will keep the IRS happy. Very thought provoking.
1,very bad read,I have enjoyed Gregory's novels of the Tudor era & expected this to be the same. How disappointing! It's like medieval porn. I could not even finish it. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I'd like to removed from my Kindle as I don't even want to own it.
2,Suspense will kill you,"I'm not a reader at all really. I'm your average teen playing video games. My mom picked this book to do my book report. This book just keeps leading you on. The suspense is great. It makes you wonder. The book about is about friends you can't trust with money and you are trying to hide the money from the police. They found money in a downed plane, that's all I will say about the book. What would you do. The reason it was not a 5 is because the ending was to fast."
2,Excellent Book,This book is a great resource for Christian women striving to live Biblically in a world filled with uncertainty. It references concrete examples from Scripture of Biblical characters facing anxiety and the model for our reaction to the same. I highly recommend this book.
1,Handle broke!!! UPDATED - FREE REPLACEMENT,"UPDATE: I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH ON WEBSITE. COMPANY RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT AND PROMPTLY SENT A FREE REPLACEMENT. VERY GOOD SERVICEMy daughter loved this ball so it was very disappointing when the handle broke in half down the center!! She only had it for 9 months. I am unable to contact the company because everything is in Italian on the website. I tried to send an email, however, I am not sure I will receive a response. There is no telephone number listed either."
1,Waste of money,"I had to write about this in hopes someone else does not get stuck with it! Our daughter is 9 months old now, and feeding herself; I agree with other reviews in that EVERY bit of dropped food gets stuck in the holes. I got so frustrated because I could not clean it, I removed the screws to try to take it apart to clean...but it still does not come apart where it needs to! I am going out today to buy a highchair, and I am extremely irritated that I wasted my money on such a piece of junk! (who designed this thing anyway!!??)"
2,missy is awesome..,"when i first heard this cd, i didn't think i would end up liking it very much, but after a while it really stuck to me, and i ended up listening to it a lot."
1,A hodgepodge mystery...,"I thought this novel had great promise when I first started reading it, with the marriage of modern day and historical witchcraft practices and discrimination, anthropology, small town suspicions, and a gruesome murder in a remote Scotthish location. I felt that the entire storyline just dissolved about half way through the book, with no clear direction of plot or character. It also didn't help that I thought the main character to be wholly unbelievable and even a litle bit annoying with her irrational outbursts and sexual escapades with both genders. It seemed to me that the auther tried a little too hard to add twists and turns to his novel to keep the reader's interest going, but in the end had so many loose ends to tie up that it was completely unsatisfying."
1,Is this a Pixies album....or just a Pixies Rip-off?,"I've been a Weston fan for years (6 to be exact) and this album confirms what I thought 2 years ago - Weston peaked with 'Got Beat Up'. Anyone who truly loved the band previously known as Weston will understand in one listen why this album is more self absorbed than a Kevin Costner Movie. They have taken on the persona of a mellow-dramatic indi-rock band with so much to say (whah, whah, whah). The only decent song is track 6 sung by Dave. Unfortunately for the true fans, without Chuck at Bass there's no punk in Weston's rock. Unfortunately for Weston, they are not talented enough to make the punk-emo cross-over (unlike Blake of Jawbreaker-Jets to Brazil). So, if you want to listen to a pixiesish/alternopop/coolie band with nothing to say, the new Weston is for you."
1,Cooks starts quite well but still cannot find an ending.,"In Chromosome 6 Robin Cook sets a great scene, builds both characters and suspense but as usual comes up with a lame ending. Like other Cook works, I rate this book six stars for all parts except the ending. Perhaps, the publisher should omit the ending and allow the reader to supply his own."
1,Overboard with the antics,"I'm a fan of this author, but she tried too hard to make this book funny and it came off lame. It was also boring. Davy was wonderful in ""Temptation"" but he was different here, totally lacking in sex appeal and personality."
1,Very Boring,Dan Baker's book is boring in everyway. All the arguements he uses to refute Christianity have been articulated better by better atheists and agnostics. Baker essentially misunderstands Christianity and is therefore a poor critic. What Baker needs is a library card so he can read what some truly thoughtful atheists have had to criticize in Christianity. This book will be a waste of time for deep-thinking atheists and a hindrance to amatures. His style is droning. He over-simplifies everything showing no apptitude for understanding the complexity of the issue. The general mood is of a teenage boy who revels in talking bad about his dad. Atheism used to have more dignity. Humanism used to show more restraint and compassion.
2,"Please, do something!!","This is one of the most exciting mini-series I have ever watched. This movie stays with you while other movies fade in your mind. I first read it as a book and later found it on VHS. It definitely needs to be made onto DVD, so, how long will it take? Who must be contacted to release it onto DVD?"
1,we die alone,"i have read the book but was not happy just because is almost the same as the book ( AS FAR AS MY FEET CAN CARRY ME).some pages were exactly the same , word by word.it look like it was a copy of the other book( as far as my feet can carry me)i was very sorry that i bought the book and lost interest very fast."
1,Poor Looking Shells,I was very dissapointed with my purchase as the bullets look nothing like 45 cal. bullets should. The gun deserves much better looking bullets. There is no reason these cannot look more authentic even at a higher price which I believe people would pay.
2,I couldn't put it down!,"Nhamo's journey is completely compelling. The story is wonderful, exciting, and intelligent. A must read! Awesome!"
2,Antuan and Ray Ray Fine As Eva,"They cool and man are they fine and they're other song""feelin' it"" is also real tight I love them can't wait to they make a cd!"""
1,as bad as pop gets,"""'Band on the Run' SHOULD [my emphasis] have been a disaster""? It WAS and remains a disaster."
2,You will not be deceived by this version.,"Carmen is one of the most popular and performed operas, so not just any performance can be put on screen. I liked this version. It is well acted (specially by Luis Lima and Leontina Vaduva) and well sung (by everybody) and I felt each singer had the right timber voice for their respective roles. A very appropriate use of cameras and a clever and tasteful set design, direction and montage contribute as well to make this version worthy of its release on DVD. You will not be deceived by this one."
2,This disc is sick,"I really enjoy this album. Although I thought that the newest album ""a grand.."" was far different a style and more about girls. Which made me dislike it some. But ""Original pira..."" has a real hip hop feeling, the feeling I got at old graf shows with heiro and Souls of Mischief. The beats are real underground and brought back a lot of memories from the writers meetings I used to go to. The lyrics are sick, and the english accent reminds me when I partied in London,. I liked that place so much I want to go back there and marry the girl that works at munchkins, a fish and chips place on Bloomsbury st. But that is besides the point. If youre into real hip hop and not all the mainstream club trip, than I gaurantee you will like this album.. Chur"
1,You have to be stubborn to finish this book,"In Maine, as I write this, it is ""Mud Season"", which was an appropriate time, as it turned out, for me to read Dark Lady. It appears that Richard North Patterson is going through his Mud Season period with this effort. I agree with those that point out that he is unable to write convincingly in the mind of a woman. I agree with those who have said that the plot of this book is confusing at times; that the characters are not fleshed out and in the end you really don't give a damn about Stella or the problems and issues she is dealing with. In a word, it is a tedious read. I have usually enjoyed this writer. Many of his earlier novels were first rate, but this is not one of them. I hope that the next effort will be more succesful and that he gets back to the type of writing he is clearly capable of."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this at Best Buy and I will be returning it today. I set everything up like it said, I put my dvds in... and then the whole thing fell apart. Of course this was after I alphabetized everything. I have built a ton of stuff, mostly from Ikea, so I'm not a complete idiot. This is not worth the money."
1,This book is garbage. Actual rating: No Star,"Do not take anything this woman says as accurate on any of the women. If you've done real research on any the ladies in this book as I have, you will know that this book is dreadful fiction. The book seethes with Prose's obvious envy of famous women, it reeks of it. She distorts what few real events she mentioned through that lens. It's the National Enquirer folks. Wonder how she would feel if someone gave her the same treatment she dishes out?"
1,Good Songs with Good beats remixed with mostly bad or at least worse beats,"Good Songs with Good beats remixed with mostly bad or at least worse beats, kind of like Nu-Mixx Klassiz.It's really nothing worth spending your money on, baby don't cry get's remixed with Black Eyed Peas' where the love is the only song I can play without puke...It's bad quality on the remixes, I guess that's why they didn't get the Outlawz to rap some new raps on it, how they got Jadakiss and Busta is beyond imagination.Crap...."
1,Not Good,This is not for beginners--not everyone can teach people how to dance and this is one of those instances. The instructor goes so fast... she does not give you time to really get the moves down before she goes into the next routine.I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. There are other DVD's out there and I would strongly suggest getting one that is for beginners and where the instructor does enough reps to make sure that you are following it. Rania has some good ones that have helped me.If you have the belly dancing basics and want to give yourself a challenge then this may work for you. I am just learning and it was hard to keep up since I am still ackward on my feet and with swinging my hips.
2,Smashingly Good,My husband and I have met Susan Peterson and many of the potters that are in the book. The book presents works by the artist as they would present them to a friend. The photos and writings really put the glaze recipes in focus.
1,Boarding school adventures,"A 16-year-old Navy brat heads off to the Maryland boarding school her mother and grandmother attended, intent on having a good time and living up to their warm memories of the place. Her hot temper and tendency to dismiss people get her into trouble, but she quickly befriends the class leaders and has a good old-fashioned time learning to ride."
2,ALL HAIL THE NEW MASTERS OF METAL!,"Lamb Of God is one of the most intense bands to ever grace my cd player! from the second i put my head phones of, I was rewarded with some of the most insane and powerful metal I have heard in a long time! It restores your faith in the music industry! when a band with amazing drumming, pounding, blunt bass lines, shreding guitars and gut wrenching vocals comes along! I had the honor of seeing them yesterday, and I must say It only gets better live!! Randy is one of the most charismatic front men I have ever seen. He was able to keep the crowd going even though he was a lil drunk! His stage presence reminded me of that of Iggy Pop, truly stand out! But Lamb of God ain't no Punk band! these guys are pure american metal! and are worth ever penny!"
2,Sarah Connor Second Season Rocks!,"If your a fan the second season is a ""must see"", I enjoy having the DVD set because it is worth the re-watch from time to time. In reference to the series, I was very disappointed when it was cancelled, season two ends in a bizarre manor that leaves you saying.... WTF? Other than the disappointing ending, I love it and recommend it as a ""must have""!"
2,Not All Known To Me Prior To Purchase.,"Some of the 16 tracks are quite well known to me, including Jesus Is Just Alright by The Doobie Brothers and Laser Love by After The Fire.The former may not indicate the band's personal spiritual postion, however this song could easily be covered by a Christian artist with excellent results.Johnny Cash certainly did that with Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.There are two songs by Kerry Livgren of Kansas, Slow Motion Suicide and To Live For The King, both sung from the heart.Musically Roy Buchanan's The Messiah Will Come Again is very good, only I struggle to hear the lyrics, Alice Copper's Nothing's Free has a suitably menacing tone and The Call's The Walls Came Down is possibly the standout from this collection.Some of the remainder are middling, but overall this is well worth owning."
2,Great Keyboard,"I have had this keyboard for over a year now and first off have to say that I do love it. I am an avid gamer but I am also a writer so I type * a lot *. That being said, I am also female and have longish nails. Within about 3 months the keys had no letters left on them because of the letters being scratched off. I also agree with the other user about the volume control being very extreme and I do not use it either. Those are my only complaints about this keyboard, other than that I love it and would recommend it to anyone. Gamers will also love being able to use it with Vent and having the LCD showing who is talking."
2,"fun for families, couples, mulitiple ages",Sequence is s great game for just about any age group. This size of playing area makes the game very easy to visualize patterns.
1,For an experienced historian,"Becoming Citizens was a good book about the plight of women in California. It is filled with great detail and a lot of well researched facts. However, it is not a book for a novice historian. Being a US History major, I found myself lost with the lack of explaination on the women's plight. It is a great book to use as a reference for a larger term paper or thesis, but not for the average reader."
2,"Expensive, but worth it","While it's one of the more expensive options, the quality of the product is definately worth the money. Leaves everything clean and protected with a good scent."
2,Plum Hilarious,"I have loved every Stephanie Plum book. They are laugh-out-loud funny. In this one we find out who came to visit at the end of book five, get better acquainted with Grandma Mazur who still finds great delight in visiting the known or unknown dead at the funeral home, meet various other wacky individuals, and in general enjoy madness and mayhem. I only wish Ms. Evanovich could write two or three times faster!"
2,This book is...,"...I'm not really sure: ""brilliant"" is overused, ""unique"" is often used as a kind way to say poor, ""exciting"" - yes, exciting, but it's oh so much more. Everything is an understatement.This book was the deciding factor in my choosing to become an English teacher if that says something - which is should."
1,Pretty Basic Tutorial,"I learned a few things with this tutorial but most I had already taught myself. If a person were being introduced to his or her first database this course book would be helpful. I, on the other hand, am continuing my search for more definitive information about Paradox 7."
2,That's the way it should be (done),Booker T and the MGs playing their thang. Have they ever been better?? This is really grovin time - has been on top of my list for years. I am sure they are gonna stay there. Go get it!!
1,fry like bacon,i had this amp hooked up to 2 12inch max pros and it sounds great for a month or so but i fried this amp twice so if ur looking for short term then go for it but otherwise dont waste your time
1,"a DECADE, I think NOT!","Bill Engvall, is one of the Funniest Comedians in the US. However this DVD is ONLY 16 minutes long! IT is NOT a decade of Laughs but 5 (five) funny music video's. I was VERY disappointed. Even the cover is misleading...showing heaps of different concerts...5 blinkin' clips. Sucks. Don't bother. If you DO want a GREAT Bill Engvall fix, Try Bill's ""15 degree's off Cool"". Fantastic!"
2,Excellent Source to Bond with your Children!,"Dr. Cohen did a fabulous job writing this important manual for parents/guardians to use with their children. As an avid student of child development, play is how our children can best articulate their feelings and need to others. It is our job as caregivers, educators, and skilled professionals to acknowledge what children are trying to say when words can limit or misinterpret their means of communication. Play can help us understand our kids as well; help encourage them to express themselves in a safe and non-critical environment. I highly recommend this publishing for caregivers, students, educators, and practitioners, alike."
1,Not airtight,"This container is not airtight. The lid, where it attaches to the container, has a good seal. However, the flap on top does not. If you upend the thing, the top flaps open. It's well-constructed otherwise, but this is a pretty obvious--and avoidable--design flaw for something supposedly intended to preserve coffee.I would definitely not buy this again."
1,Not comprehensive coverage of exam material,"I have been using the exam cram series in preparing for all of my MCSE test. Until now I have been completely satisfied. The IIS 4.0 book is missing several components that are covered on the test. One such topic is sub-netting of TCP/IP addresses. This was not covered in the book, and was on the test. Personally I think this should have been left to the TCP/IP test, but if it is going to be on the IIS test it should be in the book."
2,No Wires No Worries Mate,I bought this set up last year for 45.00. Which was very nice. It arrived new in the box. It was a snap to install and program the hot keys. It is very internet friendly with forward and back buttons and a scroll wheel. Best of all when not in use I move it and clear my desk for other tasks. Both the Keyboard and the Laser Mouse are very easy on the AA bateries. I replace them about once every 10 months or so. For that price and no wired headaches it was a no brainer.
1,went dead and doesn't hold charge,thought I would give it a try to save moneyone didn't hold the chargethe other doesn't hold the charge for a reasonable time
1,Rather be fishing,"Take a nap before you watch it or else you'll fall asleep like me. I like a good goofball horror flick as much as the next guy, but this one is just a wannabe. It had potential with the comic book scene transfers and musical undertones - both elements which i liked and thought were quite creative - however, i just couldnt get past the horribly annoying and retarded characters, like the deputy - uggg! That first gore scene where dude's eating the pie in the kitchen did manage to squeeze a giggle or 2 out of me, though. So there are a few laughs and some decent effects, but for the most part the attempted slapstick is just too corny for my tastes. And not that it always matters in the horror genre, but the dialogue and script were just awful and contrived too. I give it a couple stars for the gore but I might suggest you rent this one before purchasing. Who knows, it might grow on me like Cabin Fever did. Word up"
2,If You Can Read Then Buy This Book!,Plain and simple: This book is a must for every human being that can read. Either for rainy Sunday afternoons or for a bathroom book. Get this book!!!
2,Not Better Than Meteora,"Comparing Meteora and this album together, I'd say that Hybrid Theory is the lower weight. Hybrid Theory is definitely a great album, but not as powerful as Meteora. It's not that I hate it, because it is getting a high-quality rating, but, I just like Meteora Better. Songs like One Step Closer, Points of Authority, and Papercut are still perfect songs to work while hearing.Rating: 4 stars/5 stars"
1,Ronco is a Joke-o,"This is without a doubt the bottom of the line food dehydrator. A friend bought one of these because it was so inexpensive, but it turns out it was just CHEAP. This thing doesn't work in the most generous sense of the word. Without a fan, even if you constantly rotate the trays, the food doesn't dry evenly. I own an Excalibur dehydrator and that's the way to go. I gave this product a rating of 1 only because there wasn't a choice for a lower number. The actual rating is much closer to zero."
2,A true masterpiece...,"Cowboy Bebob has been hailed, and rightfully so, one of the best animes ever. However, all of the praises for it have already been sung, but the thoughts present in all the positive reviews it recieves are very helpful when considering this anime. The statements regarding music, combined noirs, and a show like no other truly do this series justice. This first DVD is an especially great compilation, the first 5 episodes being some of my favorites. This series is highly recommended, even if you're not a particular fan of anime."
1,Cut beyond recognition,"Originally saw this film by it's release title: ""Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle"" and the cuts and edits required to remove the lead characters name in addition to the cuts made to make this have a R rating render this a slim shadow of the originally funny (albeit tasteless)animated comedy. This pale version of the original is basically worthless and difficult (if not impossible) to follow."
2,I've NEVER read a BAD book by Nicholas Sparks !!! He's AWESOME !!!!!!,I've NEVER read a BAD book by Nicholas Sparks... I finally purchased about 6 of his books... I could NEVER get them at the library... they were ALWAYS out.... Now my friends can read them once I'm finished reading them :) GREAT reading !!!!
2,WOW!!!,The Princess Diaries #2 is awesome! It keeps you interested because Mia seems never to have enough problems! (haha) meg cabot is awesome. she writes like an actual teenager and it's SO GOOD! do all of u meg cabot-lovers know that she is coming out with 3 new books this fall 2002 and spring 2003?
2,Breathtaking Interplay,"This is an album of three incredible musicians at the height of their powers in a live setting. Lane's playing is almost beyond description. From clean comping to incendiary hyper-speed runs, Lane covers it all with conviction, emotion and breathtaking virtuosity. Hellborg's bass sound warm but packs plenty of punch as well. Hellborg is an amazing bassist who has a certain style that is very endearing. Sipe's drumming is solid without gettng too busy, which is helpful when you've got Lane and Hellborg going nuts in certain spots. There are plenty of dynamics and lovely melodic interludes along with the fiery playing. For fans of power trio interplay along the lines of classic Cream, Hendrix Experience, etc. this is as good as it gets. This defines the state-of-the-art for power trio improvisation. Nuff said!"
2,Sweet!!,"Brown's book is packed with loads of entertainment, loads of educational information, and loads of stunning anagrams. although the ending is a bit trite, this book will leave you breathless!"
1,Beautiful Movie - horrible Europe-DVD,"Don't be to sad, when ""Yentl"" will be published in Europe in July. Why not to be sad? First reason: Sound in 1.0 MONO (!!), second reason: Picture in 4:3 - no widescreen, reason three: no Bonus, no Extras ... nothing!And that's the worth of this DVD: Nothing: To publish a Movie on DVD, which called itself ""A Film with Music"" in Mono is a shame. To use the format 4:3 for a Movie (not a TV-Series) is a shame too! Shame on MGM for this publication which I will not buy, BECAUSE I adore ""Yentl"". This beautiful movie with so much beautiful Music deserves much, much more than this."
2,Another Great R.A. book,"although i was disappointed with the noticable lack of Drizzt, this was still another great book by Salvatore which continues the long line of books usually focusing on the dark elf, but oh well."
2,System not too bad,"Not a bad product. It works better than standard litter boxes. True, the unit and the cartridges are somewhat pricey, but it does the job. I have three cats and have had some trouble with one of the cats not wanting to use it at all. Also, I did have my entire unit fail but the company was prompt in replacing it via snail mail after I call the 1-800 number. Be careful cleaning the unit and don't get water inside the electronic components because its NOT sealed. The cartridges are very convenient"
1,Yawn,"I mean no disrespect, but why do I feel like everytime Ilisten to a new Duncan Sheik record, I'm either going toa funeral or coming away from someone's wake. And eventhough the music is melodically interesting, the lyricstake too long to get into. I feel I cannot to what he'ssinging about."
1,(...),"(...) This is the most cheapest product I ever bought, It is so cheap it broke a week after i bought it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Hilarious!,"This Cd is pretty hilarious. I love the parody of cliched 80s-90s action film themes, ""America, F##K Yeah"". And I don't know what that last guy was talking about Matt and Trey not getting any money for the movie. they got a lot of money for it considering they wrote it, directed it, and did like all the voices, plus Trey wrote all these songs and performed a lot of them.But Matt and Trey have said it's cool if fans download their songs for free, they're just happy that people like it. But this CD is way worth your cash,GO BUY IT NOW OR I WILL SEND MY NINJA MONKEY SLAVES TO ASSASSINATE YOU!!!"
1,Deeply disappointed,...I wasted my money on this video. My daughter just absolutely loves all of the other Baby Einstein videos and does not care for Baby Newton at all. I felt that the animation did not personalize the video and really did not connect with the child...My daughter will not even sit through this one once.
1,"This is a bait & switch, you will receive a knockoff","The title claims that this filter is ""by Dirt Devil."" The picture shows a filter by Dirt Devil (green label & writing on top). But what was shipped was a knockoff by Crucial Vacuum. It does fit and works reasonably well, but it is not what was advertised."
1,Watch out.. NO CD INCLUDED!,"I was expecting to receive the book, it supposed to include a cd but it didnt. Now i have to buy another book or try to find the cd somewhere else."
2,Leaves You Laughing,"Any Kind of Luck is not the kind of book you read on an airplane unless everyone around is wearing earphones. The vivid imagery and colorful characters will force you to leave an imprint on someone else's eardrum. If chicken soup is good for the soul, Any Kind of Luck is good for the heart. William Jack Sibley's book is a melting pot of small-town characters, puntuated with dysfunctional family members, coupled with gay relationships...not to mention a menagerie of Chihuahuas at foot. You will find yourself anxiously awaiting the next hilarious entry in each chapter. Witty, charming and heart warming. With William Jack Sibley, it has nothing to do with luck, but everything to do with talent."
2,"real cool, but not all piano boogie woogie","This is another collection of cool 30's & 40s blues, but more big-band blues than per-se piano boogie woogie. Quality is similar to, or superior to, Membran's supercheap box sets. This has plenty of notes, but they're all in German. Not that much overlap with the 10 CD ""Boogie Woogie"" on Membran.Boogie Woogie (10 Cd Box Set) 200 Songs- Original MastersWell worth the bargain price. Obviously, sourced from fairly rare and often battered 78's."
1,a lesson in missing the mark...,"When I saw this great ensemble cast I thought wow, it has to be decent; then a professional poker player recommended it. Okay I'll rent it. Wow. Very painful to watch. The biggest problem I could see is the writing; specifically the story lines are very weak and the dialogue between characters is absolutely awful. So many stereotypes and cliches. I did manage to make it through the entire movie but was very disappointed overall. Kelsey Grammar is in the movie for about four minutes total and his is by far the worst performance of the bunch. Ray Liotta is passable as is Whittaker. Bassinger and DeVito are very mediocre which led me to conclude that the director is as much to blame as the writer. I would not watch it again and would not recommend it."
1,Stopped working...twice,I bought this iPod audio system. The first one stopped working within 5 weeks. The replacement stopped working within 1 week. Forget it. Find something else.
1,"""Sunrise"" remix- NOT worth it!","I LOVE Duran Duran, but I wish I had my money back for this import single. ""What Happens Tomorrow"" is an incredible song, but I bought this for the Eric Prydz Mix of ""Sunrise,"" hoping to finally hear a club mix that actually included the vocals. (The first batch of remixes found on the ""Sunrise"" single all neglected to include Simon's full vocals.) Disappointed again! The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the ""Queer Eye"" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix. Shame on Epic records & Duran Duran!"
2,Perfect,"I must say up front, I don't have this particular CD, although I have other holiday CDs by Perry Como. I just want to second reviewer Rodney Wiltin's comment about the track IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS. I have it on another CD and, in my opinion, this was a perfect take and is, by far, the definitive IT'S BEGINNING. All other performances of it are lame in comparison. I play it many times during the Christmas season and it awes me."
2,"Strong follow-up to ""Fate's Right Hand""","For my money the best track is the Harris, Prine, & Crowell delivery of ""Ignorance Is The Enemy"" -- most all the founders said so -- and it's never been proven to be so true until today.The Harris & Crowell duet cover of Dylan's ""Shelter From The Storm"" is a masterpiece. As Jimi Hendrix did with ""All Along The Watchtower"", their rendering of the song is a much more than a tribute -- they have added dimensions to the song I had never heard before.Rodney is one of the best song writers today -- and (in there different ways) ""The Obscenity Prayer"" and ""We Can't Turn Back Now"" prove that.Keep up the good work Rodney!"
1,Not an 8 inch pan,"I am single, so I use two fry pans; a six inch, and an eight inch, but I use the eight inchthe most and just buy the cheap Farberware pan at WalMart and toss it once a year when thenon-stick surface becomes a stick surface but thought this was not good for the environment,so went for this pan due to the good reviews.HAY GUYS, THIS IS NOT AN EIGHT INCH PAN!My six inch lid fits fine on this seven inch pan.It measures 7-1/2"" ID, 7-3/4"" OD. Nowhere does it measure eight inches.An eight inch fry or saute pan ID should always measure close to eight inches, this pan does not, and is much closer to my 6"" pan than my eight inch pan.It is going back and I will pick up my third cheapo pan from WalMart."
1,not for me,The music did not help in my meditation. It was actually distracting. No wonder no samples were available for listening.
1,Chasing Her Own Ambulance,"I was really excited to get my hands on this book. Having suffered from eating disorders myself, I was hoping it would re-affirm my recovery efforts.Imagine my surprise and disappointment after drowning in the hubris and shameless self-promotion that pours from every page of A Very Hungry Girl. The book prompted me to write my first Amazon review.I couldn't believe that there were positive Amazon reviews until I noticed that many of them hail from the author's friends. This manuever is wholly in line with the thinly-veiled thesis of the book. The author hopes to profit from her disease and even more abhorrent, the suffering of others.I wish I could write that the book is mediocre but at least the intention is heroic, but I cannot.Please, please, please read Life Inside the Thin Cage by Constance Rhodes for less ego and more inspiration."
2,unbelievable,this album has such a fresh sound.it's good to hear people are still making great music.would recommend it to everyone
2,Always enjoyed Henckels scissors,"I've used Henckels kitchen knives for over ten years and have enjoyed their durability and cutting blades. However, I enjoy the Henckels scissors even better due to their precision and smooth cutting, especially compared to competitive products. The next time I need to buy high quality scissors, I'll be seeking Henckels first."
2,Nuggets From SF's Golden Age,"Although he has since been overshadowed by John Campbell, Groff Conklin was an influential editor who produced several collections of science fiction short stories long before SF was fashionable. This book contains a treasure-trove of stories by authors whose names are still familiar as well as a few who may be new to the younger reader.I certainly hope a new publisher decides to reissue some of Conklin's collections. It has been too long since we were able to enjoy stories by Kris Neville and Ross Rocklynne."
2,"Must read for TRUE Rap, Hip Hop and Run-DMC fans","If you are a TRUE Run-DMC FAN as opposed to a listener;if you are a TRUE student of Rap's beginnings;if you are a TRUE student of HIP-HOP;THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR LIBRARY. Id go as far to say the lessons learned in regards to the music industry, and its treatment of rising or new artist could serve as a knowledge foundation for those aspiring to be in the music industry.WALK THIS WAY and GET THIS BOOK"
2,Best Price Router,I have shopped locally but can't match the price I paid for this router. Reviews have been very good. I believe it is what I need to fabricate and install new kitchen cabinet doors and plan to use it soon.
1,"Excellent Sound Quality, HORRIBLE cord quality/durability","A warning about the long term durability of these earphones: the cord will ""break down"" and eventually develop a series of holes in the rubber casing exposing the wires within. I am on my 2nd pair and will not purchase a 3rd. It has taken maybe 6 months each time for this to happen. This is with what I would consider normal use with my Ipod. I love the sound quality, but the durability makes these unbuyable in my opinion."
2,I Adore This Book!,"I don't think I've read a more satisfying yaoi title. The story was fantastically executed. Yoshinaga Fumi doesn't jerk readers around with the drawn out will they/won't they formula. She gives you the goods from the start, yet still finds creative ways to keep you in suspense.The romance between Gerard and Jacques isn't the common BL fare, and BRAVO TO THAT! Gerard is an older man, Jacques is much younger (there was a shota scene in volume 1 even). Gerard isn't handsome. His face is disfigured. He's not ugly by any means, and he has elegant and regal qualities you see in a older man. He was so well-rounded. You understood his curmudgeon way of thinking. This attitude made his romance with Jacques even sweeter.You know, I didn't expect this to be as fantastic as it was. I don't care for the other licensed series the creator has out. This book shows her true skill.Lets have more titles like this! Enough with the school-boy stories."
2,Move Closer,"Too bad for a majority of the population of the United States that this song is not available. Why must America be stuck with the top 40s from the 70s and 80s when music like this is available? It is clearly the best thing on the airwaves, albeit the internet. The only way the yanks will hear it is by listening to Heart 106.2 from London after 10:00 PM Central. Stunning vocals and music. This is a must have! What a pity......."
1,An Overblown New Yorker Article,"Although the title looked enticing, I was greatly disappointed as I read this slim volume. I was vaguely told what ""Nobrow"" was, but no whys, no wherefores. Was it a celebration of Nobrow or a critique? The book contains profiles of what the author sees as noted Nobrow figures, like David Geffen and George Lucas. They seemed to be re-edited New Yorker articles, and are nice as they go, but after 200 or so pages, I still don't have much of a clue as to what Nobrow really is. I did, however, learn who the author was. He seems to be the sub-text of this book. We know he is a feature writer at the New Yorker, a Princeton grad, and lives somewhere in Tribeca. If you want to read a book about today's culture and its roots, read Thomas Franks' The Conquest of Cool. If you want to read a book about the New Yorker, try Bright Lights, Big City. At least it's more honest."
2,Exceptional!,"Since I heard the song in Highlander III movie, I decided to download MP3 files from audiogalaxy.After I downloaded those files, I had no doubt that I need to have this album. I went to Amazon and ordered this CD (with also a book of Douglas Adams).I don't think that this music is like Enya. This is totally different quality and flavor."
1,poor quality,"purchased this bag for my husband to use for his adult soccer league which meets once weekly. After using it for one season, the pockets ripped, leaving the bag useable, but all one compartment. disappointed in the quality of this bag. opt for a different Adidas bag."
2,great seller,"Great product, a little smaller than my other one but no one would notice. It was for a halloween prop.Would use this seller again."
1,Very disappointed,"This item only worked twice before it simply wouldn't work again. And no it was not dropped or in any way abused.I read the instructions before using the item and couldn't figure out why it won't work.I'm very very unhappy with this item. When it did work the sound quality was horrible, full of static and could barely hear what I had recorded. Definently a waste of your money!"
2,Definitive Gettysburg,"This is an excellent movie for anyone interested even remotely in history and is a must for Civil War buffs! Although, it is a long movie, I feel that it is truly worth the viewing.The first half of the movie seems to move more smoothly and quickly than the second half (which is why I only gave it four stars). The main reason for this, I feel, is the superb acting by Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as General Buford. Both of their performances are truly masterful.The second half moves more slowly but is still worth watching. The battle scenes are extremely well done and I particularly appreciated the fact that the movie was actually filmed in and around Gettysburg and in the park itself.I felt that the weakest characterization was that of Robert E. Lee, for while Martin Sheen's acting performance was technically well done, I did not feel he captured the essence of Lee's personality.Well worth watching more than once."
2,not the best but very good,"I've played some previous version of ddr and always loved them. as it's getting bigger in the states they are including some more american music, which isn't the best selection on their part. I bought this for my girlfriend who fell in love with ddr extreme at a friends party. so she's pretty new to it and while the beginner level is great, the levels progress a bit too quick. all in all though it is a blast! but don't buy cheap pads ($9.95 ea)! ours are warping already :/"
2,SNOWFLAKES AND FROST NICELY EMBODIED NICELY,"Michael Gettel's WINTER is a compilation of previously released tracks, along with new tunes making their first appearance. Gettel is a proficient pianist but his solo tracks are rather bland. It's the ensemble and/or orchestral selections that truly capture the landscapes and whimsies of the season.Songs like FLIGHT, FIRST SNOW, WINTER'S TWILIGHT, SHELTER, WHEN ALL IS QUIET, and MEMORY IN THE SNOW conjure up vivid imagery of the emotions and visages of the wintry environment."
2,Excellent Overview of International Environmental Law,"Although this book is dated, the topics discussed are still worth reading. The book can still be found through the National Registry of Environmental Professionals (847) 724-6631."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"The radiator sleeve will not expand to fit a standard radiator hose. The rest of the sleeves work fine for heater/ac hoses, fuel lines, and vacuum lines. Amazon sent me replacement packages with the same problem."
2,Love It BUY IT,"One of the best Vin Diesel movies I think. I love this movie, probably my favorite of its genre. Blu ray makes it even better."
2,Great,"All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Sheer Lace Top Back Seam Thigh Hi Stockings)"
1,"poor handle design, not enough measurement granularity","The handle is too short. Even when less than half-full, this cup is uncomfortable to carry. It feels like the handle is slipping out of the hand. This is especially unpleasant and potentially dangerous with a liter or two of boiling hot water. The handle needs to be at least 2cm longer or a be a full loop.The markings are printed at an angle. It's barely perceptible, but nevertheless noticeable. There should be more markings. You can only measure from 2 cups up in one cup intervals, or from 16oz up in 16 oz intervals (or do some math) or 500ml and up in 250ml intervals. There is plenty of space for more marks."
2,"Good, but not on their own.","I'd highly recommend these books in conjunction with the 'Transcender' exams. Together they cover basically everything, and if you want proof I managed to become an MCP with no hands-on experience."
2,"I really like this unit, it is so cool!","My friend introduced me this product which was just brought into market. I did not know this product is so COOL until I saw it. Comparing to other similar products, the price is really attractive. I also like the quality of the LCD screen. It just vividly showed the pictures I got in different places. Although this product is not from a big brand but I think the quality is nothing less than something from a big name."
1,Does NOT fit the S Series notebook,"Once you get the package, if you read the cover it says it is not only for the S series but it also for another type of laptop. And the laptop case is meant for laptops that are up to 15 ins. I bought this thinking it would snug fit with my S Series notbook but it was WAY TOO BIG! I kept the package for the power cord case. Other than the power cord case fitting, the case for the laptop itself is CRAP!"
1,CHEAP CONSTRUCTION!,"I recently was given this toy by my mother. After reading the directions I spent over an hour trying to assemble this toy. The key word there was TRYING. NO I never finished assembling the toy. Most if not all of the pieces that were supposed to snap into place were not aligned with the correct holes. And the reason I didn't finished assembling it was because the top of it which is supposed to ""snap"" on like the directions say, bent. The more I tried to straighten it out the more it bent. In the end I had to return it. I would definitely highly recommend NOT buying this toy. It's more trouble then it's worth."
2,Thought Provoking,This is an excellent book. I could not put it down even for a moment. It really makes you think. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
1,Avoid this Unit,Beware. This unit easily falls off its mount. There is no remedy for this condition; simply a well intended but overall poor design. Save your money and avoid this product. After about 18 months of stopping to pick the unit up off of the ground several times a week it finally fell off the other day and I didn't notice.Can anyone recommend a better unit?
2,Great for your legs,"I love this DVD. Although it say's ""killer but"", I feel the greatest change in my legs and core. I got this DVD because I felt that my legs needed strengthening and a lot of toning since they were getting flabby. This DVD is really intense and as other reviewers have stated, its redundant. Even though this is the case, I find it really works your legs mostly and if you do the exercises at least 3 times a week, you'll definitely see results. My legs are toned and I love how my thigh muscles look - even my inner thighs! The muscles are long and strong- like a ballerina's! Can't say there's much change to my butt though - well I didn't have much to begin with anyway. I do feel an overall strengthening - in my core muscles, and arms (due to all the movement required). All in all - buy it if you want strong, ballerina legs!"
2,Does what I bought them for.,Looks good in my car. Simple and just gives the car a clean feel. I recommend if you just want carpets for the car. Not sure how well it will do over time but seems to do what it's suppose to.
1,Don't buy this DVD,"This is the second unit we bought from this manufacturer, and both only lasted a few months. We bought it to watch movies from Europe, and we thought that the DVD player had a reasonable price. But, after having got two, and having to buy a third one now, it turns out that it will become more expensive than having bought a more expensive one from the beginning. Don't buy it if you want to save some money and spare the hussle of having to get a new one every few months."
2,Pump saving use of timer.,"We have been using this timer to control a well pump at the bottom of a deep, slow filling well.The timer is set to turm on the pump every 15 minits for 2 or 3 minits 24 hours a day, untill the storage tank is filled, therein not drawing the well to the bottom at a time of high water demand. The water is delivered to these large storage tanks, 500 to 5800 gallons where it is drawen off at high demand times (morming and evening). This preserves a weak flowing well, while providing a large volume of water to service the home, and storing water to fight fires, feed crops and farm animals. The water is preserved and disenfected by bubbling ozone in the tanks 24 hours a day. The timer is simple, easy to use and indistructable. Over the past 20 years I have installed many of these systems with these timers which have allowed many folks to stay on property with weak wells that normally would have resulted in the loss of these properties."
2,DELICIOUS!!!,What a delicious feast of recipes! I've dined on Chicken Piccata. It was great! Now to try her Chocolate Mousse...I can't wait!Florence Henderson is a multi-talented woman...and one of the nicest people there is!
1,It's About Frickin' Mermaids!!!!,"I remember when I was little and I liked Goosebumps' books and there was a new one and it had a shark on it and it was gonna be sweet, cuz I liked sharks too. But then I read it and it was about frickin mermaids! I was so pissed off. In fact, thinking about it now I'm still pissed off.Buyer Beware!!!!!!"
2,Great turtle!!!,"This is the cutest stuffed animal ever. Made very well and a good size, not too big or too small. My grandson loves it."
2,Bosch wiper blades fit 2007 Mercedes E320,A perfect fit; just like the originals.At a decent price too.
1,total waste of money and time,"Ferenc Mate is the most negative person I ever read. There is a message to his title but the book is nothing but one long, boring bitch session with little or no practical information."
1,Died in just under 6 months,Professional in name only the Hot Tools 1177 died after 6 months of very little use (2 or 3 times a week on one person only). Save your money and get something that you won't have to replace in a few months.
1,Perhaps the worst book that I've ever read,I read this when it first came out and hated it. I could not understand what the fuss was about so continued my excruciating reading to the bitter end. The main character is repulsive and un-engaging. Twenty years later a very intelligent and witty friend told me that it was his favorite book and I read it again to see what I'd missed. Nothing. I now think considerably less of my friend.
2,Correction,"Reader Darren supplied incorrect credit for this book. Globe Pequot Press was not the original publiser. The publisher was Fast & McMillan, with the imprint of The East Woods Press, a small regional publishing group in New York City."
2,Fleetwood Mac,"Fleetwood Mac is definitely one of my favorite musical groups of all time, and this is one of the best, if not the best, CD that you can have of them.I can't say anything other than everything in this CD is wonderful. Get it, trust me. You'll find a favorite among this collection."
1,Big Disappointment,I was very disappointed by this rice. I paid a lot of money per pound and it tasted like any regular parboiled rice. Also the rice was from Argentina and not Italy. It tastes nothing like the creamy rissotto rice from Italy. I do not recommend this rice to anybody.
1,Not that good,"Ok..first off....I've always been a huge Descendents fan. I bought everything they ever put out when it came out...(im old). This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I can't even believe it's them. Very uninspired and uncreative. The lyrics, riffs, energy, and excitement is just not on this record. Why couldn't they be that band that put out the ""ALL"" album? You can argue all you want...but I would bet money that if you like this record you are way under 25 years old. I'll give it two stars only because they are still actually putting up the effort."
2,Good Light Soy Sauce,"This is a very good light soy sauce.Nice delicate color. Salty with good flavor.I think the previous reviewer was a bit confused about what light soy sauce actually is. Unlike many american products, the word 'light' in reference to soy sauce does not mean 'light' in undesirable ingredients like fat or salt.Light soy sauce actually has more salt in it that dark soy sauce. It is called light soy sauce because it is from the first pressing of soy beans and is lighter in color."
1,No one cares about the contents of this book.,"If you feel that your blog is getting a little too succint and you want to lighten it up with some real drivel go immediately to Ms. Mason's book, open any page and do what she tells you."
1,Marginal Text,"I used this book for a college-level linear algebra course and found it marginal. Although the author is clear, he skips steps and does not provide ANY answers to exercises in the back of the book. Sometimes you can find the answers to exercises in proofs contained in subsequent chapters. You really need a good professor (which I thankfully had) to get the most out of this course and book."
1,One long song that is repeatedly interupted by track changes.,"What on Earth is this supposed to be? Perhaps the title is more befitting of an adjective to describe this album than the band intended. Namely... nothing! The entire thing consists of a sonic bombardment of the most annoying distorted guitar tone one has ever heard. Rather a lot like putting your ear up to a really old, broken vaccuum cleaner and turning it off and on over and over again. Deafening nonsense. Those who find this review unhelpful: quick, get back to the mall before it closes!"
1,Do not buy this,"This product is junk it does not support DVDs from any other country except the US . Did not support our family vacation DVD from Asia. Sony a global company ,not so.WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!"
1,Lousy,The sound and recording quality was terrible. RCA does not make a good recorder. Sony makes a good one. The RCA recording was nearly inaudible.
1,Jagged Little Pill was better.,"Alanis got a little desperate to make another CD, so she didn't try very hard. I admit, Thank U is a good song though. One in every 17 Americans own Jagged Little Pill."
1,"What exactly is your beauty, America?","As always Kevin Spacey does a great job but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an Oscar!Oh yes after you see the movie, you know that such stories usually get Oscars. But no one can understand why! If you analyze the movie deeply you'll see that it has to do with Hollywood stereotype against a specific type of discrimination! This is becoming the ""American Beauty"" trend since the early 90s!I give one Star for good acting + one Star for a nice way of telling a bad story with a shocking tragical ending... that is all!"
1,innaproprite/bad choice toy for a child,"This is clearly a bad choice toy to give a child.Faults: inspires plain/flat out gothic behavior, inspires evil, dark/scary looking features, slutty, innapropriate.Never in my life would i let a child play this toy."
1,Nice at first,"I could hardly wait to give this toy to my pet for x-mas. He did enjoy it while it lasted. As of Feb it no longer works and I don't see a way to possibly check the battery (if there is a battery) as the unit is contained inside. It was not handled roughly as I have a toy Brussels' Griffon. For whatever reason, it decided to stop working over night, and unfortunately, without the sound, my pet isn't interested it in."
2,Even adults never tire of this one!!!,I work in an elementary school with children of all ages and do a ton of babysitting. When I first heard this CD I fell in love with it. Every child that I've introduced to it has also loved it. It's one book/CD even an adult won't get tired of listening to!
1,Disappointing in the extreme,"This is the poorest writing and one of the worst books I've read in years. I would have put it down many times, except that the subject matter was so topical today. And that is the one redeeming factor of this book - it is a fictional account that could so easily be tomorrow's headlines. Still, it doesn't make up for the paper thin characters, forced plotting, and awful cliche-ridden writing style. I can only imagine the amount of editing that must have gone into bringing this book to market, and it still doesn't deserve to be sold."
1,"Well intentioned, poorly written","Dr. Caner has set out on a noble cause to present a view of the Islamic world through the eyes of women, but he fails at effectively reporting on this. Specifically, the case studies used are rather vague and not only that, but built largely on assumptions. The actual narratives from the women are ignored in the analysis, where superflous information is added in order to give the womens testimonies whatever bent Caner intended."
1,FURminator disappointment,"This works fine on my golden retriever puppy and my tabby catHowever, it doesn't do anything for my two golden doodlesThe tines are too short and the head is smaller (width of area from tines to back of head) than I expectedI was hoping to find a tool that would allow me to save money by grooming my dogs at homeIf I had seen this myself at a local pet store, I would have known it wouldn't work and I would not have bought it"
2,Tasty (when cooked) mix.,"Recently my husband and I decided to live Gluten-free for health reasons. The mix is a bit expensive considering how much a bag of flour costs, but I'm surprisingly happy with the results so far. Chocolate cookies are great with this. We can't even tell the difference. Just don't eat the batter."
1,Unhappy,The product did what it was supposed to however one of the terminals broke when I tried to tighten it on first install with minimal pressure. It's pretty much good for a paper weight now.
1,zuchini recipe is bad no liquid needs 2 cups,"Hi allConsidering that these recipes are used to get the body ready to cure itself, they need to be tested by GERON. I tried the zuchini and rice recipe and was amazed that it did not state how much liquid to use. After the required 1.5 hours in the oven the rice was a mess.So, I placed all the ingrediants in the pot and cooked with water added 2 cups of it. Then it was fine. Obviously GERON had not used the recipe.IDIOTS as usual.Why can't people do it right?Capt GP"
1,PUR DS-1800Z 2-Stage Water Dispenser,Noticed the water started tasting funny and when I went to change the filter I saw it was cracked. Has potential but should be a little thicker material. Pitcher version works fine.
1,Costs $10 per month,"WARNING: Unreliable. Stopped working after just three months. At $29, cost was nearly $10/mo plus electricity for a very dim light. For the most expensive light bulb I've ever bought, I expected more. Average bulb life 60,000 hours??? I got about 240 hours out of it at most."
1,WHY ???,"I never bought this item so why is it appearing on this list, please let me know the answer ok??"
1,I'm with Roberta,"I have five types of feeders in my yard. This is the least popular, both for the birds and for me. Designed to accommodate both perching and clinging birds, it's uncomfortable for both. Perching birds -- those that figure out how to do it -- get into the bowl, ""bathe"" in the seeds, and leave behind unwelcome calling cards. Clinging birds have trouble gaining purchase on the holes provided. They'll grab a seed or two and head off for a ""restaurant"" with better service. I like many Droll Yankee products, but how this one made it to market baffles me."
1,Thanks for the reviews!,I'm glad I read the reviews for this book. How stupid to print a book in black and white when teaching a graphics program that involoves color. It stopped me from making a purchase. I'll now look for the colored teacher's edition.
1,Mediocre,"I thought this would be a great deal for the price, but cover was incredibly wrinkled upon washing and had no duvet ties to secure it. I've had it for a year, and buttons have popped off, etc. Seems cheaply made. However, I used it for one year in a dorm and it served its purpose. Just don't expect to use it for an extended period of time."
2,Just what I was looking for,"I've tried a couple other DVD's and a book and didn't really feel I was getting good use of my exercise ball. This one was just what I was looking for. The format of having 3 separate workouts of 10 minute length provides some nice flexibility. Also, having variations for me as a beginner was nice so that I am not getting frustrated since I can't do the hard stuff yet. The upper body workout requires some small weights (10 lb. and under works), and since I already had those, it worked out well.If you are looking for a solid workout that will make you sweat while working all your muscles effectively...this one is it."
1,Betrothal at a Tender Age: 'Twas Nothing New...,"Except that the gentleman was a kidnapper!Lady Lucinda Esmond's swine of a father was forever gleecing young bucks in London's gaming halls - until he met Captain Mark Chamfrey who, having been cheated, promptly kidnapped ten-year-old Luncinda for ransom!But, when Chamfrey thought better of it and returned the girl, Esmond exacted his own price: Chamfrey could save his skin by marrying his little victim nine years hence. Time enough for Chamfrey to inherit a title and fortune.Lucinda's father could not have foreseen what a beauty Lucinda would become. Nor that Chamfrey, a newly made marquess, might welcome the fulfillment of his punishment!"
1,Great until it died!,I loved this iron for the first six months. More than enough steam to iron the most wrinkled cotton shirt with no effort. Until that is it simply stopped working after six months - everything works except it no longer heats.
2,********* READ THIS ******************,"This item only works with Logitech brand keyboards. From the reviews seems like the buyers have not done the proper research and Amazon description does not state that either.So, unless you have a Logitech brand keyboard this item will not work for you.Hope this helps those that are still looking"
1,Biased,"This book is very biased towards home births. also read The Bradley Method, and felt that this book although it incorporated some of the same ideas, didn't seem to line up with the Bradley Method. I also found many of the pictures unnecessary. I must admit that I didn't read this all the way-but rather skimmed the topics and eventually returned the book!"
2,Very Convenient!,"Used for a long road trip with 2 Cars. The Cord lenth isn't horrible, it was ok for my use but I agree... it could be longer. Overall for the 13 bucks I paid for a used one was worth it."
1,HATED IT!,"To each her own, but I thought it was idiotic, and, I won't buy anything else written by this author."
1,Don't bother,"If there were a way to give this negative stars I would.If you are looking for an electronic babysitter with some educational value, this is the software for you. However, the interface is not intuitive; the voice-overs sound forced; the program is twitchy if you happen to ""leave"" the window during a demonstration or practice.They advertise 3 or more program levels per subject. I have yet to find anything of the sort. The printable worksheets are only useful if you have a printer immediately handy. They do not appear on the screen ever that I have seen. They can _*only*_ be printed out.It's rigid, restrictive and unforgiving."
2,Very Satistied,I recieved the P90x package earlier than indicated at purchase. The package contained everything expected and items were in very good condition from a viewing stand point. I have just begun to use the product and hope the DVD's have no blemishes that affect the viewing. I am very satistied with my purchase.
1,Total disappointment,"We bought this set of printer ink in November 2011. When we tried printing the colours looked horrible! We did everything to rule out printer fault because we could not believe that this set of ink could ever be knock-offs, at the price we paid. This set should include photo colours so can you imagine turquoise blue water printed as brown! There are no green or blue hues; all our pictures have a reddish brown hue. Will not be caught again. BUYER BEWARE!!"
2,Goddess of Yesterday,"This book about Anaxandra, a true princess at heart, is a wonderful example of an epic, and is a great read, filled with suspense and history. I applaud Caroline B. Cooney for her execelent masterpeice."
2,How do you spell charming?,"Oversized collectible softcover, with stiff covers and pages; the pages are sturdy enough that small hands won't bend them, yet they can be cut with scissors or an exacto knife. (the instructions on the back recommend a blunt knife.) But I think this looks fun for adult craftpeople!Complete instructions inside, and the watercolor illustrations are just adorable. Highly recommended!"
1,"not the ""classic"" Fireman Sam","My son was very disappointed with this dvd. He said, I want to watch the ""plain"" Fireman Sam....This is the new computer animated version, more action, a bit more drama, but still ok, for little kids..We will stick with the ""plain"" versions!:)"
2,Best I've found,"I had a very old version (version 2) and was looking to upgrade. I first bought a different product that cost twice as much, but was disappointed with the many bugs in the software. I then read some reviews and bought this. Big improvement in the stability of the software as well as the features. I found it to be fairly intuitive to use.I would like to change a few things, like being able to export to a CSV or delimited text format so I could compile my own recipe books externally. I would also like to be able to customize the views more, such as viewing certain fields as columns in the cookbook or recipe list view so I don't have to always go to the search function.I have found the import function works quite well. I especially like the Internet Explorer browser plug-in so I can import recipes right off web pages without having to save them as text first.Very nice software.Addendum:MasterCook 9 imported my old MC ver 2 cookbooks flawlessly and easily."
1,Not as advertised,Product was advertised as NEW but it had been opened. With this type of paper it needs to be brand new to confirm that it hasn't been exposed to light. Had to ship back. Company refunded $$ but I had to pay shipping back.
1,Unreadable,"Because of intractable notation (presumably introduced in another Karatzas-Schreve book) and careless exposition (author is completely free of thinking about reader) where proofs are absent, sketchy, or simply thrown at the reader with a shovel, one needs an hour per line (of text) to read this disorganized book. Add here pretension of applied science - this material is completely absent of application (ask any options manager has he ever heard about Karatzas!) and you have a book which only application will be as a shelf weight."
2,Can it be? FINALLY!!!!?,"Well, guys it is finally almost in our hot little hands. Heir to the Shadows is almost to the shipping stage, and the saga of Jaenelle and Daemon and Saetan(et al) Is ready to continue. If this is even half as good as Daughter of the Blood(and Anne assures me that it is) We are all in for a treat... oh and for those of you out there like me, who haven't even gotten their hands on this one yet and already want the the third one, there is hope Anne was already working on it last year when I asked. Let us all pray, and beg and plead...... until we get all three."
1,What is she talking about?,"I am currently enrolled at Harvard Medical School, and I must say that this book is an insult to me and the thousands of graduate students everywhere. The advice given in this book is totally useless when it comes to preparing for graduate school. there is no way one can spend all of his/her time just studing, in between classes that is. Only through hardwork and constant studing can one ever achieve what one sets out to do. These people are bozos. Thank You."
1,anti-scientific sensationalist trash for the gullible,"Before ANYONE buys this book, please just ask yourself one simple question: ""do I want to be thought an idiot by people who are not idiots?"" If the answer is a heartfelt ""no"", then take the next step and read this: [...]. Read the dissection of Gary Schwartz's methodology (or lack of one) and you'll understand that this ""scientific"" analysis is anything but, and that in fact Mr. Schwartz must have had a solidly established bias in favor of the existence of an afterlife before he began writing the book.The only use for such a book is in helping the public understand the modern epidemic of profiteers distorting and co-opting the entire idea of science - a good cautionary tale and nothing more."
1,don't do it,"I am a huge Koontz fan. However this was one of the most painful book I have ever read. I did the Kindle version, and it was just page after page of not much print and or story. Interesting concept, but not my fav Koontz title. Sorry, but i can not recommend this at all."
2,Excellent product with a bonus,"I bought this filter expecting to reuse the old pre-filter. Surprise, this filter comes with a new pre-filter despite not listing it in the ad. Makes a good price Great!Fit perfectly. Very pleased!"
2,very pleased,"I've been looking for this half season of Nip/Tuck since I found out 5 was 2 parts& was so excited to find it,,,,,I love Nip/tuck,,,,& Amazon.com for having the dvd's I want :-)"
2,Forgotten event in history.,"This was my second purchase of this book. Purchased the first one from Ken Small himself while visiting Dartmouth/Slappen Sands area a few years ago. Was trying look something up in the book when I realized I couldn't find it. Some sections area little quirky, but overall an interesting book."
2,One song a true classic,"I'm writing this review just on the basis of one song alone - Loneman. This is truly an obscure classic if not an ahceivement in popular music, it starts off as a predictable blues/funk groove that suddenly breaks into one mother of a grunge chorus. Even then when you think you have it all down, out jumps this guitar solo that takes the song away as if it has just strapped it to a rocket ship. I haven't heard of Daniel Larson or anything about these guys apart from this album, but there are some hellacious sounds all over this disc. The only problem I have is with the sound quality, the mix tends to sound a bit muddy in places with the vocals pushed too far back. Overall there is a good variety of moods here, but in my opinion Loneman is the standout by far and something I wish I'd heard more of through the album."
2,Notes from a teacher,"This series is a great series to use in the middle school/high school classroom. For the first time my students were actively engaged. They couldn't wait until the next time and they even asked to read longer. Darcy and her friends are characters that explore race, relationships, single parenthood, and many other aspects of life. It was great to find books that my minority students could really relate to."
1,Overdone,"Although this book has some fine moments where I think the author really speaks to the readers and lets them know what Josephine's interior life might of been like, these moments do not make up for the failings of the book.The author seems so pleased with herself for the research she did it is as if she cannot stop reminding the reader of all that she learned. I found the footnotes to be insulting and many times writen as if the reader had no knowledge whatsoever of the time period or of Josephine's actual life. The author was so intent on proving that she had throughly researched her subject that she let it disrupt the flow of her novel.I was impressed with all that she knew about Josephine and France, however I wish she would have incorporated that knowledge into the body of the novel instead of endlessly intrupting her often engaging prose with footnotes.Overall not a bad book and I did learn some new things but I wish that her style was less self-conscious."
1,Disappointing. They really cheapened this product!,"The ""most critical"" review says:Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange!The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!- - -A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion. Doh!"
1,Find something else to read.,"For some reason this book tries very hard to get its audience to be sympathetic to a man who falls in love or so he thinks with a girl he doesn't know. Trying to be faithful to the ""Love of his life"" he sleeps with every one in his town from widows to 14 year old girls when he is past fifty. Not the type of person I am usually sympathetic for. The main character doesn't have any redeeming qualities except poetic writing but even that is over the top. How can you write thousands of pages of love to a girl you know nothing about except for her name? This book is so unrealistic, the characters are not interesting and the plot keeps getting sided track to events that have no real importance at all. The only likable character (and I say that lightly) dies from a pathetic tragedy that seems at first to be relevant to the plot even if it is unlikely but no that too was just more wasted words. If this is what I can expect from Oprah's list I will steer clear."
1,Bad battery,"I bought from the store and I charged 6 hrs as stated in manual. Next evening when I back from work, found out that battery was totally running out and couldn't even find the display. Then I tried again charging until charged fully and next day it happened again. I immediately returned to store. Also I noticed some echo."
1,"This Book Should Be Titled, ""Dude, I Hate My Country""","You know, I tried to read this blatently liberal biased book with an open mind. But anyone who has the slightest bit of common sense (anyone who believed BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was a true documentary is exempt from reading on further)or basic powers of observation can't help but be offended by this pathetic attempt of literary enlightenment. This Socialists' deep hatred for his paranoid idealogy of the Republican party, the Bush Administration and anyone related to it, seeps through practically every chapter. I challenge anyone to confirm the facts and statements in this book. You will find out, as I did that some people, or authors, will say anything inflamatory to sell a book or make a buck. If this joker could make a buck off of screaming FIRE in a crowded movie theatre, he would and then he'd figure out a way to blame the U.S. and President Bush. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Excellent Product,"I bought this product to create DVD movies from my SONY Camcorder and I love it. It is an excellent product, easy to install and comes bundled with Nero.FK"
1,COME ON!!!!,"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten."
2,Sakura,"is about a girl who sets free clow cards, from a book called the Clow. Out comes kerberos,(A.k.A Kero-chan) and turns her into a cardcaptor. Sakura must now find and capture these cards before they come to life and do ""evil"". This was my first time reading Cardcaptor Sakura, and I love it. I give it 5 stars for it's plot and great drawing (style). It is very cute. I love it! Can't wait until the next book comes out!"
1,Horrible performance,"5 stars for this DVD? You can't be serious! The production and stage settings must have cost millions, but the artistic content? I was a great admirer of Domingo when he was at his best, like in the video of La Traviata. Here in Aida his voice is flat and lacking in warmth. I can accept a fat Aida with shoe polish in her face if she sings like a goddess, but such is not the case here. And if you have heard Cossotto sing Amneris, a performance such as we have in this Aida falls flat on it's face. There is a feeling of coldness in this production and you feel strangely dissatisfied after only a few minutes of viewing. I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews here because I somehow trusted the taste of the reviewers. If I see 5 stars awarded to another opera DVD, I can no longer be sure that it is a DVD I can order with confidence. Sorry."
2,Sweet Baby James Is Born,"There is nothing like the raw simplicity of a new artist's initial work, and this album is no exception. Little wonder that APPLE and Peter Asher saw the genius that is James Taylor back in London in '68. And thank God for that!James' talent is attested to by his musical longevity and the respect he is given by other perhaps bigger-selling artists.It is often said that genius comes from pain. James' debut solo effort whilst on heroin & coming to terms with an unfathomable world is ... well ... simply fabulous and the versions of 'Carolina In My Mind' and 'Something In The way she Moves', to my mind, are far superior here to the later slicker versions he did.Sure, this talented musician went on to write several more great hits as he ""matured"" into the mellower performer & writer he is today, but for me, this beats the lot! A must-have!"
1,mask fit,"Reading the positive reviews, i thought this would be a no brainer. Unforunately i was wrong. The mask material is properly made, but the fit was not snug at all. Everytime underwater there would be a leak and water would easily get through into the mask. I've had to adjust the goggles mostly everytime i complete a leg in the pool. I've had to go back to my original swimming goggles to having an uninteruppted swim. FYI - i am an adult, asian male and maybe this just didnt properly on my face. Maybe having a flat nose affected the placement. I believe if there had been any mention of face structure, it would have been a huge factor on deciding to purchase these swim goggles. Now I know and hopefully this helps someone else."
2,Fill the house with good spirit,"Gently energetic, happy, love to listen to the fine guitar playing AND the articulations of confident singing voices. I like having this filling my living room or kitchen."
2,"Good, but not my favorite Dekker book","While I very much enjoyed this book and found it a solid, good read that quickly kept me turning pages to find out what happened next, it's not my favorite of Dekker's books. I would have to say the Black/Red/White trilogy is by far my favorite, followed by the Martyr's Series books."
2,Inexpensive leather repair,"This product works well when you follow the instructions, but it takes some patience. I accidentally oversanded the area I was repairing, which could have made the leather look worse, but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it. I was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair, and I think this repair won't be noticeable, as the damage is lower on a chair leg. Take the time to mix the color to match the leather, do the repairs in daylight, and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying, and it works pretty well!"
1,satanic verses,I'm having trouble sticking with it. It's a little nebulous and I enjoy more concrete of a style. I'm still not sure what got him into so much trouble but it does speak to the attitude of Islamic people Catholics have been ridiculed and seem to take it better
1,Could be a lot better,"As a PIC beginner I was hoping for more than this book provides in the first few chapters.As already pointed out the title is very misleading; there certainly aren't 123 ""experiments"". Many of the 123 articles are to do with the ins and outs of programming in C.The typos and other mistakes don't help either and don't fill you with confidence when what you do doesn't reflect what the book says will happen, e.g. experiment 7, p31 where the LEDs I get aren't the same as indicated, and looking at the circuit, you'd never get the LEDs lit as indicated in the book.Sloppy."
1,Doesn`t work,Don`t waste your money. This doesn`t work.The product description said it was for my phone. However It doesn`t charge my phone at all.
1,Disapointed,"Ordered this for my wife as a Christmas present She was excited to watch these with my daughters, but upon closer examination there were two copies of the second movie and no copies of the third."
1,Sinks Under Its Own Pretensions,"Wilder's project, Recoil, sinks beneath its often pretentious ambitions to marry electronica with the New Orleans soul blues sound. Coming from a cold, Anglo Saxon, it sounds like a more desperate attempt to bridge some sort of unity with rich pop stars and the bereaved poor of NO. The album is mostly murky and gets absorbed in the background. Wilder sounds like another tony Londoner trying to take on more than he is capable. As far as being the soul of Depeche Mode, people forget the power of Gore's songs and Gahan's delivery. Wilder has always been a technician and not a musician. Technical prowess does not equal talent."
1,Poor design,"I bought this camera recently and added also bought a padded carrying case for it. During a football game, I returned it to its case, latched the cover, and set it on the seat beside me. I stood up, and brushed it off the bench; it fell approximately 18 inches - in a padded case. This short and padded fall broke the camera! Kodak refuses to repair what appears to me to be a very fragile product. If you buy this product, treat it like an fresh egg (or a rotten egg as far as I am concerned. So much for buying American.)"
1,Horrible,"The product came packaged nicely, I went out to the car popped the cassette in and plugged the aux jack to my phone. The sound coming through my stereo was complete garbage. It sounded muddy and staticky. Don't buy this product it's a complete waste of money."
2,Great simple story,I love this book and it's my favorite present for boys or girls from 2 to 5 years old. It's a great simple story that will make your child smile and think. And I guarantee that you will also enjoy and learn from Winnie's experience.
2,Very Cool Album,"Not really interested in the Rock tracks, but ROBI DRACO ROSA has recorded some great music. Rosa has a good voice, similar to Ricky Martin. The Best Song from the album is ""Crash Push"". It's worth buying the entire CD alone. Incredible slow track... ""Crash Push"" is excellent. Another great track is ""Como Me Acuerdo - Do You Remember."" The DVD Extra makes the purchase even more worth while; it's a great look at the making of ""mad love"" album and very cool 2 music videos in one ""Dancing In The Rain / Lie Without A Lover"""
2,Heart wrenching,"Portrays the wonder of the unknown and the wretchedness of betrayal by greed and powerlust. It's the history of man that should not be forgotten, but learned from."
1,Can anyone record and album and should they?,Simply unreal. This recording really should not have ever been made. This has to be a vanity recording.
2,Impeccably written,"I thought better than Men of Bronze. Would have been up in the 5 star range if there had of been a map included to show the various territories & cities. I would rate at 4 1/2 stars. I was unsure of the use of the term Iranians on a couple of occasions. I enjoyed the story,the detail & the descriptions of the battles. Very good"
2,Pretty darn good,"Yes the Wilson sisters still have it. Great vocals and playing. The blu ray is pretty crisp and the sound is solid, a definate must buy for any fan of Heart."
1,Don't waste your money,"It feels like a piece of junk, and, sure enough, after about 6 uses its on-off switch failed so that, this morning, it was impossible to shut off after I used it. I waited until it's battery died before putting in the trash. I've just order a ""Remington Mb1000 Complete Beard and Mustache Trimmer with Bonus Nose Ear Trimmer"" which I hope will be much better made."
2,Awesome DVD,"I don't know why everyone is complaining, this DVD is amazing. The Pixies are amazing. The sound quality isn't bad I don't know what that one guy was talking about. If you like the Pixies, if just a little bit, this DVD will make you happy. There doesn't need to be any extras, there's over 2 hours of quality live music for a low price. GO BUY THIS NOW!"
1,Bad Leftovers,"These tracks sound like crap. I had an original copy of this album from the 70's and this sounds nothing like it.A few years ago I tried to find a CD replacement and the only place they were available was from a reprinter in Europe somewhere. I complained on one of the many Outlaws sites and was told that the original masters disappeared over the years and the CDs were being printed by some company in France from some real muddy sounding dupes that were located somewhere.Bottom line, the muddy sound you hear from the samples playing on your computer aren't the fault of your computer's sound system. These tracks actually sound this crappy.To bad I didn't convert my vinyl to digital sooner, before I lost them."
2,The Next Chapter in About Face,"This is the post script to David Hackworth's ""About Face"" and falls short only becaue ""About Face"" was a landmark piece of work. Brings ""About Face"" up to date and is disturbing because practically none of Hack's criticisms have been acted upon by our military."
1,So Bad I Don't Know Where To Start,"This book is symptomatic of what is wrong with gay-themed/oriented fiction, that is, just about anything no matter how awful is published. The losers are the readers. Were the target audience for this book, teenage girls; then I would say, yes the author has hit the mark. However, any mature gay man must be insulted by this cliche-ridden piece of fluff. Were it funny, it might be worth it; but even the jokes are tired, shop worn gay laugh lines that we've all heard/read many times before. Always be leary of a writer who can't even weave together a narrative but relies on fake looking, unconvincing memoranda, letters and other cheap writing tricks. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one like the gay plague."
1,Don't Buy This if You Value Your Hearing,I returned this after using it one time.The toaster works only with a very loud ticking timer.No way to toast without the ticking sound.So loud that I returned it.Be forewarned!
2,WOW! Harry Potter with a Twist of Twilight!!,"I am on the 5th book of this series, and I have not been able to do anything else except read these books since I started the series a few days ago. They are fantastic! They are like Harry Potter with a twist of Twilight. I love them, and I am over 50!"
2,Excellent stable toy,Just bought and received (quickly from Amazon) this Vespa for my grandson who just turned two. He and all of his friends and etc rode it for hours. They loved it and it performed flawlessly. I constucted it for him and it went together in a few hours without any hitches. I would highly recommend this for the first time rider.
1,Awesome! One of Carpenter's best!,"I love this movie and it's one of my favorite John Carpenter films. One of the best scenes is the fight scene with Roddy Piper and Keith David and I was disappointed about the dvd because there's no special features, not even a trailer. At least,The picture and sound are good. If anybody's a fan of Carpenter as I am, this is the movie to own."
1,Poor BT connectivity,"The keyboard is nice and has a good layout and feel. I have problems with the bluetooth connectivity every time I turn the Mac on - it is almost as if it is fighting the mouse for the connection because ever since I connected this keyboard my mouse has started dropping the BT connection, although not as frequently as the keyboard does. I was surprised to see someone note the sticky key situation as I encountered a lot of that and thought it was just me not adjusting to the sensitivity of the keyboard. Would love to keep it plugged in but it is too frustrating to fight the connectivity."
1,Useless,"I recently bought this camera and, although there were detailed instructions on how to install the software, there was no software included. I called the technical support number 4 times and each time, was told I would receive software in an email. It's been 5 days and still no software. It's a cute idea, but virtually useless without software. (Incidentally, the Sakar website does not provide the downloads for this particular model either)"
2,"Works great, a bit noisy","We have a Coleman air mattress (the 4-in-1 air bed) that we only use in our home (as opposed to camping). Consequently, getting an electric pump seemed like an obvious choice. The coleman 120V Quick pump works great and is designed to work with Coleman products. You blow up the bed, then when it's fully inflated, push in to lock and then manually seal the bed. It works perfectly and easily as described and is a great purchase. The only caveat is that it is a bit noisy, so if you have close neighbors or sleeping kids, aim to blow up the bed earlier rather than later in the evening."
2,Fantastic!,"I had originally watched this back in 1990. I recently got it as a gift. This is a fantastic film! It covers Stravinsky's entire long life and touches on his major works. There are clips of interviews with Stravinsky (and him conducting his music) through out the film as well as his children and other intimates of his (including the somewhat controversial Robert Craft).A few other reviewers complained about the length (too long, not long enough), or the fact that the sound isn't up to today's digital standard. To me, none of that matters. It is amazing and fortunate to have so many spoken words by Stravinsky himself all in one movie."
1,Dubya's pet 'tard,"""Keith's got his head up his *ss- Cause it's George Dubya's way!"" A bunch of crotch-grabbing faux-patriotic B.S. No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're a bunch of redneck retards."
1,Poorly done,"I can only compare this to the Laurence Harvey LP that I lost 20 some-odd years ago, and it is a poor imitation. It becomes apparent immediately that Mr. Prysock is an amateur when it comes to dramatic reading. This poem requires a skilled professional, such as Mr. Harvey, to provide the tonal nuances and subtle changes of cadance that bring these words to life. Also, the music is inappropriate and in many places overpowers the speaker. Use your money to buy the book."
2,A Must Read,"Bush on the Couch is a MUST read for all Americans, including Congressmen and journalists. Dr. Frank gives a compelling and frightening analysis of what makes George W. Bush tick. Run, don't walk, to your library or bookstore to pick up this insightful study of a man who -- you will conclude -- should not be president."
2,Billfromthenexis,I enjoyed the read. I would recommend the Micheal Whitman books as a nice complement to this book.
1,"Wait a minute, think of the Daddies!","Hey, wait, you guys! Think of the Daddies. I'm sure the creators of this cover were thinking of all the daddies who get to look at the image of this Anne while their precious little Britneys and Mimseys are reading all about demure and delightful Anne inside the book. Why shouldn't they get a little blonde eye candy?"
1,Waste of a tree,"This book is nothing more than a compilation of other tests gathered from other sources with no regard to the actual exam. Some of the questions are wrong, misspelled or just plain outdated. The guide given by CBP is much more useful....and free. None of the exams are of the same style of the actual test and the mathematics portion does not concentrate on the areas needed."
2,"Overall, quite good for TSR's 2nd attempt at Sci-Fi.","Overall, Alternity is a good game. It allows for just about any kind of campaign a GM might want to run, and the rules don't seem too hard to get used to. Though I did find that the armor rules needed a bit of tweaking (they made armor too strong), that was the only thing I could find about it that wasn't up to snuff. Highly reccomended."
2,This album will become a big part of your life...,"...I guarantee it. I got into Pavement kind of by accident. I ordered this album from my local library just on a whim (I'd listened to Amazon.com samples and was not impressed) to see what if I liked it up close and the real cd. This instantly became one of my fav albums and made Pavement/Malkmus a big part of my life. For me, Pavement is the kind of band you get into ""phases"" for and leave alone for a while. Malkmus' lyrics are cryptic to the point of inscrutable and despite the fact that this guy writes completely indecipherable lyrics for the most part, he still has a huge following, so what does that tell you? I know most Pavement fans consider ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"" to be their best, but I actually prefer this to CR, CR. Every song is amazing and like I said, if you are new to this group and get this album, be prepared to become obsessed and fall in love."
2,As Good As They've Always Been,"This is the first CD from Jackson Browne of acoustic live material, in what I hope becomes a long running series of volumes. His voice is still as crisp as when these songs were first recorded. The sparse sound of only a piano or guitar really highlight how well written and thought out the lyrics are. The production is perfect with great sound quality, and they gave the introductions their own tracks. This avoids having to listen to a minute or more of Jackson talking. If you are fan you owe it to yourself to pick this is up. Jackson Browne is timeless!"
1,DEVOid,"Devoid of originality. Anyone with a couple Devo or Cars albums doesn't need this CD. They will find any way possible to repackage old sounds as ""new"" since the children of today haven't bought anything older than themselves."
2,love this storyline,"both my son and daughter love these adventures, I recently found out this is actually based on a story of books, I bought the first book and can't wait to start reading to my kids."
2,Good album from INXS,INXS / Kick: This one has a few big radio hits and the rest of the songs are good. This is a very enjoyable album. The bonus cuts are ok. Four Stars
2,Great Upgrade Kit for Less,These guys are great .... best place to get ram upgrades. This is the third time I have used them for upgrades.Their software will check your system and tell you what you have and what upgrades are possible.Hasn't failed me yet and the prices are sweet!
1,Flawed Amazon Instant Delivery service,"The lack of subtitles (my hearing is shot) rendered a muddled script virtual unintelligible to me. The disclaimer regarding subtitle availability by streaming device was buried deep in the fine print of the FAQs and disclosures.; I only looked when I realized subtitles were missing from my download. Fortunately, I only wasted the promotional money given to me to join the service. I will have to rent the DVD when it becomes available throughj Redbox."
2,"Works well, but creates a lot of dust","I got this kit, and wow, it works well. I used it on wood as well as drywall.Cutting the holes in the wood worked well, and there was definitely some sawdust to vacuum up afterwards, but not to bad. However, cutting holes in the drywall ceilings produced a lot of dust, much of which was blown into the air, despite drop clothes.Overall, I'm definitely happy with the too, but as other reviewers have commented, it does create a lot of dust at times."
2,Easily the best braces for computer usage (especially MACbooks!),"For the longest time every time I used my desktop (i have small computer space so my wrists ending up bending on the edge) or using my MacBook pro my wrists would hurt and it would be very distracting. While Carpal Mate isn't quite as effective and you may feel slightly more discomfort than with the more popular full size braces, it provides more range of motion and is a lot easily to get in and out of. These are also much much better for gaming."
1,Disappointed,"After hearing of the mighty Gov't Mule for several years now, I finally decided to take the plunge. I am very disappointed. Perhaps I chose the wrong album to start with? Maybe only once or twice is some sort of tangible ""groove"" established on this album. The rest is off-beat guitar hooks that go on for way too long and a drummer who doesn't know when to stop playing fills."
2,great!,Was referred to this book-using all three I ordered for help in understanding the minds and lives of our encarcerated brothers and sisters. I'm in a prison ministry.
2,Bill Peet always brings a positive outcome to a difficult situation.,Bill Peet always brings a positive outcome to a difficult situation! The little caboose found a happy ending out in the forest he loved. Thank you
1,Don't bother...,"I am really amazed at how little substance they managed to pack into such a thick book. There are very few practice questions and I found the math questions easier than the old SAT. Also, there are numerous errors made by Kaplan throughout the book. They really sacrificed quality with this publication. I'll be waiting for what the Princeton Review puts forth later this year."
1,The Original Is Better,"Back in 1988, on a friend's recommendation, I saw ""Wings of Desire"" in the theater and loved it. Subsequently, I was interested when Hollywood made its own version of Wim Wender's film with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, both actors whose work I've enjoyed. I saw ""City of Angels,"" and for the most part I liked it -- that is, until the very end. What a DOWNER!! No matter that the movie gets all psedo-warmfuzzy-philosophical and time-to-get-out-your-handkerchiefs, it misses the point of the original film, which was a celebration of Human Life and Love. I own the DVD of ""Wings of Desire."" One viewing of ""City of Angels"" was enough for me."
2,Curtis is a great singer,This man has a great voice. He has soul all the way down to his toes. Good songwriter too. Other Curtis albums are more consistent but all of them are worth owning.
2,Great workout!,"This is one of my favorites! Just like MuscleMax, this is a nicely structured workout for men and women."
1,Pathetic,"Really disappointed over all in the NationalGeographic toys. This one also failed miserably in performance. This was purchased for a 6 year old for Christmas. As another review stated you can't keep it in alignment or focus even as an adult. The 6 year old was NEVER able to focus in even on a big bright star.He got very frustrated from trying and even started to cry. You can see more with our pair of binoculars. Save your money and go for a higher power and better frame, ect."
2,A must-have for any STYX fan!,"If you like Styx this dvd is a must! ""Lady"" and ""Come Sail Away"" are Styx songs still often played on the classic radio stations; however, what about classics such as ""Lorelei"", ""Suite Madame Blue"" or even ""Boat on the River""? This dvd will provide you with a front row seat for an amazing Styx experience! Don't miss out!"
2,The Virginian,I loved it. I would recommend it to any fan of Western movies. Pullman and Lane were superb. I look forward to more Westerns like this one.
1,No HD Audio for Movie Only Edition Blu Ray,"This review is for the movie only blu ray edition. I am giving it a one star rating because the movie only edition shortchanges the consumer. As indicated in some of the prior reviews, this edition only comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. It does not come with any High Definition audio tracks. Most blu ray movies typically have at least one HD audio track whether its TrueDolbyHD or DTS-Master Audio so the average consumer may not be aware of this deficiency because they've come to expect High Def audio as the norm for Blu Ray movies. If you want the DTS-MA audio track you need to pony up some extra money to get the more expensive special edition. This is important to know for anyone who has a decent home theater set up with high definition audio and want the best sound possible."
2,Got it! Love it!,"Yes, I am a mother and no, I'm not a music expert. I purchased this for my daughter after seeing how much my nephew enjoyed it. BINGO! It was a hit. She likes it over Barney, and all the other 'Kids' songs and her dad and I enjoy it too!For those of you that gave it a low rating, trying thinking of the audience that this music was intended for."
1,unbelievably irritating,"this book might be useful if it weren't for the authors' seemingly implacable desire to be funny, which they are not. almost every sentence has some superfluous witticism in parentheses (usually with an exclamation point!). really, if you cut out all the ribaldry the book would be about 200 pages shorter, which would be a blessing because the reader might actually learn what she was setting out to learn. i do not recommend this book, except for people as retarded as the authors (in which case, they will probably not learn HTML because they'll actually be enjoying the sad attempts at humor)."
1,You can buy better books,"I bought this book for my husband as a gift as soon as I found out I was pregnant. It was in a baby boutique store I like and I just grabbed it, knowing nothing about it. I/we were very disappointed in it. We found some of the information slightly inaccurate. We also thought it could have covered more and was too simplistic. There are so many good, informative, easy to read books out there that do include the dad..... I say pass on this one."
2,it works,"This product works as a cord for the Wii, but it is not made by Nintendo. I thought it was, but maybe I read the description wrong."
2,Great fun!,These 2 old classics on 1 DVD of the 1930s with the heartthrob Tyrone Power are great fun to watch! A new generation must see them! Amazon'scompanies are wonderful to offer them at great prices. I'm startinga collection.
2,A Mesmerising Tale,"This book is a wonderful tale of the actual mysterious carpenter of the Sisters of Loretto and his masterful staircase. I thought it was wonderful how the staricase was a way to test the users faith in the end, with no railings on either side and built of strong and sturfy mysterious wood and wooden pegs instead of nails. The fact that the actual staricase has withstood all these years is amazing as well. I give this novl 5 stars because it covers everything that is needed and only leaves you hanging in one aspect, whisch is exactly as it should have been. Perfect."
1,umm...okay?,"My daughter received this bear as a Christmas gift. I just plain dont get it I think. It shivers when you squeeze its foot...kiddo liked that. Then its cheeks lit up pink, which kind of freaked her out. Then it sings some unitelligable song (think teletubbies meets barbie) which bothered me..I wish they had at least made it to sing something repeatable. I just dont see the point.On another note, its made very well, should hold up for quite some time! My older daughter also loves that the bear wears a tiara. :)"
2,Wonderful book,We give this book to all families who have a child being baptized at our church. It is a gift from the parish.
1,DiZ iZ dE aNtHuM tHrOw aLL yO hAnDz uP,"Remember back when life was great, before GC were born......Once again, the irony is SO DELICIOUS :)"
1,Dont order this it just waste of your money and time,i order the first time it was damaged the liquid was over the product and it was getting rusty where it hold the disk inside. when i got the replacement it just got worst inside was even more rusted and the bottle that come with was empty i wouldnt buy it not to put their business down but i wouldnt buy it
2,Perry M Season 8,"Well, what can I say. Simply one of the very best series ever and one of the best actors of all time. Great quality."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! REAL REVIEW,we had 1 or 2 rats the beginning of winter now thanks to this product we have a whole family of rats... this thing attracted the rats to my attic.. complete waste or money... NOW IM FORCE to do the $2 rat traps with springs I wanted to be nice but at this point there not letting me go to sleep... AGAIN I DONT CARE WHAT ANY OTHER REVIEW SAYS THIS CRAP DONT WORK!
1,Color Me Unimpressed,"It's a technical triumph but a storytelling disaster. I care more about story than special effects, so count me out."
1,Badly written and based on unverified info,This book was worse than i expected. First of a all it is extremely repetetive and the evidence it uses is very shaky and not solid and the author tries to twist its sources to make it seem like something it is not. i really do not recommend it at all it gets really boring after awhile. I recommend you get Nemesis by Ian Kershaw.
1,PLAYING IN HISTORY,"this movie referes to a real story of the Prophet Moses, but it does'nt tell us the real story and its just like trying to change history"
2,Work very well,"The chocks are easy to carry and very easy to use. They hold my 5000lb trailer easily on slight inclines. Since I got them I notice there are models that you can also use for leveling. I might have rather had something like that, but these are very good for what they are intended."
2,Good Tights,"I bought these to wear to run outside during the winter. Bad plan. Definitely not warm enough for that. They're just spandex, they're not lined or anything. With that said, they're really good for working out indoors, and I've also used them as leggings rather than for working out. They don't have obnoxious seams or a weird fabric, they're very comfortable."
1,Read your child a book instead,"Over the last few years, these Leap Pads have come in and out of my house via various garage sales, gifts, etc.. The kids play with them for a very short time, then tire of them, and off they go to Goodwill.So my kids like them for like a day, and that's it. It's just another electronic toy. The little cartridges get lost very easily and then you're stuck with books that won't work.My kids will cuddle up with me and a book everyday, for long periods of time. That's what little kids books are about: bonding with those who love you while learning. Read you child a book instead of plopping them in front of this thing. Teach them the words with your fingers and your voice, not a stylus and a computerized talking box.We don't need batteries to teach our kids to read."
2,"Lovely, but not quite what I expected","I bought this book on the strength of the spiel on the cover, and whereas it is a very good book with strong well defined characters, it was not quite what I expected. The Angel Xas is definitely the centre of the story, but (and perhaps foolishly) I expected a gentler and more angelic character. So if you're looking for the standard story of beautiful angels with wings that smell of snow, this is not for you. That aside it is still an engrossing and clever read, and I do recommend it."
1,it works,"I had broken my previous cord and replaced it. My Ps2 is as it was when I bought it,now I'm gaming again."
2,A must have for Muppet Fans!,"The season one dvd set of the Muppet Show is a nostalgic dream come true for all Muppet fans, and a perfect way to introduce a new generation to the lovable antics of the Muppets from the very begining. The menu system on the set is easy to use, and the option to watch the episodes with bits of trivia and comentary that pop up on the screen adds even more replay value. The set is a must have for any family library, and it will be used over and over again. A true classic...and there are still four more seasons to look forward to!"
1,Car charger broke,The car charger strated to catch fire the very fist time i plugged it in. I just pulled it off quickly but it was already burned. I still using the rest of the kit.
1,I like one song,"The song that got me hooked was ""Strong enough"". I heard it on the radio one day, and was compelled to listen more and more just to hear that song. Admittedly, Sheryl doesn't have the best voice out there; often she sounds strained on certain notes, and some of her melodies are strangely patterned. Still, her lyrics are something that many young, teenage-type lovers can relate to."
1,Not worth the time or money,"As with most people, I usually dig O'Reilly books, but I made a big mistake here. Unlike other ""Leaning"" books, Learning PERL for example, this learning book did more to put me to sleep rather than teach me anything about Java. There were really only examples in the first chapter, then it lost it's track and felt more like someone's thesis on the subject than a real commercial book.This book was very successful at turning me away from Java and O'Reilly for a while, until I found ""Head First Java"". If your looking to learn about Java, look at Head First, it's much better, fun and you actually learn something about java, good programming, OO and all the great subjects that come along with those."
1,worst poop scooper ever,this product is the worst ever. it is extremely difficult to have a clean pickup. It is the worst and most expensive product for poop scooping i ever bought. i would never recommend it.
1,Please avoid; but don't miss the first series,"Jack Chalker's original Well of Souls series (Midnight, Echoes, Quest, Return, Twilight) are classics, possibly the finest science fiction series I have ever read. The three books in this series are horrid, and I don't just mean in relation to the originals. Like many other writers, his energy was spent after the first few series and books, and he has degenerated into rehashing formaulaic bad prose over and over. Where he used to ""show"" what was happening, he now spends endless pages ""tell""ing in justification of the poor choices his characters make in far fetched plot. The outcome was thoroghly predictable. The plot was the most forced plot I can ever remember reading. The lectures at the end were insufferable. Please avoid. And please read the originals - not to be missed!"
2,"Julia Roberts is laughter, tears and great movies!","Julia Roberts gives out the best of her acting in both of this movies. On ""My best friend's wedding"", her overwhelming acting goes far beyond Cameron Diaz's innoncent looking, uptown girl beauty. She is ambitious, hilarious and beautiful.On Stepmom she reaches out and does not fade next to great actress Sussan Sarandon. Both actresses give the audience laughs and tears. An overall great movie."
1,Is change good,I was always an nelly furtado fan but now that she went and changed her stlye just to become famous i think is perposterous!! well she made her chocie and now i will not be her fan no more i used to look up at her music and think she was great but now i don't have her anymore so good bye nelly furtado and hello Evanescence's New Cd The Open Door in stores 10-3-06
1,Not effective for me,"I guess it is a hit or miss with this kind of things...For me it is a miss...Honestly, I have a hard time believing that repeating to me that I am feeling good, safe, beautiful or anything else is going to prove true...His voice is not specifically annoying or anything like that...I guess I am not suggestible enough for it to be effective with me."
1,Horrible,I bought this pedometer with great expectation because i wanted to know the distance and the calories burnt while walking. It arrived pretty soon so i was glad. But it never worked properly. After one hour walking it marked 24 steps and 9 calories burnt! Whaaaat? I followed all the instructions on how to set it up and looked for possible mistakes but i did everything ok and still not working correctly. Finally i attached to my shoe and it gave better numbers but different each day even though i was walking same path and same amount of time. Changed the battery but problem persistedI. Finally i gave up and threw it in the wastebasket. Only thing i like was the clip because it attached strongly and never fell or broke. A total waste of money. Will not recommend.
1,The Sound and the Fury,"Most over rated writer of all time. I have tried several of his books and do not like any of them. Try Fitzgerald or Hemingway if you want authors in his timeframe. If you want short stories, try Alice Munro or William Trevor. For my money, they are two of the all time BEST....."
1,Too much mental contemplation for a vampire that isn't human,"I saw this book in Barnes and Noble and was captivated by the cover. It seemed interesting even when i read a couple of line from the first chapter. But after having read 71 pages, I just can't get into this book. It is well written, but at the same time, he just thinks too much. Every second flashing back to memory because of the present. Also housing a little human girl for the sake that he might still be human or have some shred of humanity seems dumb. I just can't read anymore, for me there's nothing to keep going on with him and little Isuzu Trooper Cassidy. What a shame how I had hopes for this book. I have never really given up on a book so quick, shame to say this is my first."
2,Iambic tetrameters the Nabokov way,"A bit too long and deep for it's misleading title, NOTES ON PROSODY remains influential in the continuing study of English and Russian poetry. Nabokov's ideas about ""scudded feet"" and ""tilts,"" while not adopted into the orthodoxy on scansion, are still read widely by the folks who study it, folks whose bibliographies led me to this little volume. It's worth a read, especially if one would like a witty, concise survey of the iambic tetrameter in English or a study of Pushkin's deployment of it in EUGENE ONEGIN.Those who arrive here as fans of VN's novels should steer instead towards SPEAK, MEMORY (his autobio) or LECTURES ON LITERATURE for their Nabokovian non-fiction. Imagine a joke written in French here. Happy hunting!"
2,Very Satisfied,I was cery satisfied with the order. It was received in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied and happy with my purchase and would defiantely recommend it to others.I was also pleased to see the item was made in USA you don't see that too often.
1,on second unit and still not working,"Purchased this Dirt Dog in June on line at Fryes, never worked, called I-robot, they sent me a new battery, still did not work, they sent me a replacement unit (I paid to ship it to them) second unit does not work, I have been on the phone with them a total of 4 times and have not yet had a chance to use this product. Be sure to keep your original packaging in case you need to return the whole thing to your online place of purchase. Whew, I could have saved so much time sticking to my regular vacuume."
1,Maybe Would Have Liked It If The Power Turned ON,"Mine arrived as scheduled, but the power would not turn on. I had it charged for over 8 hours, and I felt the Clie get warm (so the battery was charging). After letting it charge, it would not power on. I did soft and hard resets and called Sony Tech Support. It was good support 24/7, but the tech said that he'd ""run across the problem before."" - Seemed like he was understating the number of times this happened. My advice is that this is a great product, but I'm going to buy it at a local retailer to make sure this won't happen again. I read on cnet.com another person had the same problem with both of the S360's he bought."
2,More than price,"Excelente lente, el mejor balance precio calidad, lo uso e una alpha 700, el único problema es que en no en todas la s selecciones de enfoque respeta el enfoque inicial, así que debes de ajustarlo regularmente antes de disparar"
2,Induced after-death communication,I thoughally enjoyed this book and in fact loaned it to a friend! The information in relieved me and helped me to know there is an afterlfe
1,No More Matrix !!!,"This is boring, 10 DVDs no way I'll sit down to watch that [...].When The Matrix came out I kind of like it, but when the sequels came out it was just too [...] much for me, like Star Wars, I get bored really easy with that kind of movies. But don't get me wrong in here only if you're a huge fan of the Matrix go ahead and buy this [...] . . ."
2,The best book I`ve ever read,"The book is, of course, very long, but the book is so interesting that you don`t want to put the book down. I couldn`t stop reading the book becuase the book absorbed my whole being[this is just an exaggeration]. I`d recommend this book to anybody who loves and enjoys reading."
2,Exciting mystery,This was exciting suspense filled as always from start to finish.A typical Clive Cussler mystery.I have always enjoyed Cussler stories because of the many different tales of the ancient seafarer and under water discoveries.These are things you never hear about without doing a lot of research and who has the time.
2,Lovecraft meets Chesterton.,"I really enjoyed this novel, but I can't imagine recommending it to anyone, because the author's perspective is very hard to ascertain. The prose is cleaner and easier to read than ""All Hallows Eve"", and the atmosphere is definitely less ethereal. the story is such a strange mix of Victorian and modern ideas; imagine if H.P. Lovecraft and G.K Chesterton wrote a Father Brown mystery, and then made the mystery a subplot. Again in this work, as with the previously mentioned ""All Hallows Eve"", Williams does an excellent job bringing his characters to life.I must admit I began reading Williams because of his association with the Inklings and C.S. Lewis in particular, but I am quickly becoming a fan."
2,Arrow,"Exciting, realalistic, intelligent great actingGood looking actors great script.Believable story a real super hero.Good balance between the evil and good in people."
2,"""Compulsory subordination for all"" (p. 15)","""Schools are intended to produce ... formulaic human beings whose behaviour can be predicted and controlled. ... Well-schooled people are irrelevant. They can sell film and razor blades, push paper and talk on telephones, or sit mindlessly before a flickering computer terminal, but as human beings they are useless. Useless to others and useless to themselves."" (pp. 26-27). ""Schools teach exactly what they are intended to teach and they do it well: how to be a good Egyptian and remain in your place in the pyramid."" (pp 15-16). ""School sequences are crazy. There is no particular reason for any of them, nothing that bears close scrutiny. Few teachers would dare to teach the tools whereby dogmas of a school or a teacher could be criticized, since everything must be accepted. School subjects are learned, if they can be learned, like children learn the catechism or memorize the Thirty-nine Articles of Anglicanism."" (p. 4)."
1,Don't buy for cold climate,I bought one of these last summer and found it to be almost in two pieces this spring. I drained it last fall too and it still cracked in two. Don't buy if you live in an area where it could freeze they do not have their molding process correct.
1,a waste of money,"I was really looking forward to getting this egg timer but it's a disappointment. Eggs were supposed to be hard-boiled, but they were decidedly medium - a big mess. I'm not sure I'll use this thing again."
2,great stuff,Great product at a great price. Can use this protein powder with just water or mix with juice or make a fruit smoothie. I used it for a 10 day fast and lost 12 pounds. Will definitely purchase this product again from this seller!
1,This album is a massive flop,"The first and the last songs rocked, but I could give the rest of this album a miss. I'll proababally give his next album a listen before I buy. Overall the whole album was a huge step down from Audioslave."
2,Still useful a decade later,"Part of what Anapol is arguing for in her book is the creation of a subculture or community for polyarmorous people. She should be proud because such communities do exist and in some areas they thrive. Her book is filled with her observations and her reflections based on her own poly life and her training as a psychologist. While I think the advice to be honest and go slowly is great i think her need to justify poly is overbearing at times. I also think some of her biological, evolutionary, and historical ""facts"" are weak. But if you want another book to help you sort through your nonmonogamous feelings, then this is a good starting point."
1,An American Haunting meets High Tension,"This movie is not original at all. The ""twist"" has been done, and much more successfully than in this film. If you have seen the movies mentioned in the title of this review, you know who the culprit is and what the motive is. At least I'm lucky that I only wasted $3.99 to rent it rather than purchasing the digital download. Don't waste your money."
1,Microsoft is not making split keyboards well anymore. Ergonomics must not be making them much money.,"I've been using split keyboards since 1995, all Microsoft.I could tell the current keyboard (of 8 years) was beginning to skip letters as I type -- warning signal!So I purchased a new one which has now moved to storage until I am simply forced to use it:1) Keyboard clicks are sharp or tinny -- I think due to the thin materials used for the housing.2) The keyboard speed is maddeningly slow. I have tried the new keyboard on both XP and Win 7, set both OS's at the highest speed and still the keyboard creeps until I want to throw it out the window. Regular typing is OK, but if you want to move the cursor to somewhere else on the page that has no keyboard shortcuts, take a long deep breath. Deleting, whether forward or back is also annoyingly slow."
1,Does the job for now,"This thigh toner does not seem that sturdy. It look like it might not last that long, but for now it does the job. I perfer the orignal thigh master I had in the past. This is cheaper in price and quality."
2,This jacket is doing well in the Seattle Rain,"The jacket is well made and does in fact shed water and does not absorb it.It is warm enough to act as a fall jacket, and big enough for me to wear a hoodie underneath to warm up on cooler days.The pockets are big and while they do not seal I don't have any issues with things getting wet in them. Phone, camera, wallet all have been in the pockets and have not gotten soaked or even damp.There is one inner pocket which is handy for keeping something really safe, I use it for mail and things like that."
1,Susan Lucci as she can play best,"Considering I only have seen the first half hour of this film (some of us have to work), I agree with the first reviewer who said Susan Lucci's acting is soap opera-ish at best. Susan seems past her heyday in this movie, and it's a role I thought would've been played better by a somewhat younger actress like Diane Lane or even Angelina Jolie. Susan looks old and haggard - makes me wonder what a guy like her lover actually sees in her, or why he would go to such extremes to attempt killing her rich husband. Here's a thought that crossed my mind - why do so many women married to wealthy men think their lives are so bad that they have to cheat? If I was married to someone with money I would just appreciate that I don't have to work and can spend my days looking pretty and shopping. So much for marrying for love."
2,Armageddon,"Armageddon: A Novel of BerlinOne of the most eye opening novels I have ever read about the Russian/Allied ""war"" over the Berlin 4-zones occupation situation. Hard to put down."
2,very under appreciated work,"I always loved this album although this is definitety a forgotten one. Why? It is not for lack of quality songs b/c there is plenty of good stuff here.Probably b/c this album rocked a bit harder than the others and maybe confused their fan base. It has a great supporting cast of musicians you would never expect including members of Cheap Trick. It also is heavily Todd Rundgren influenced and it sounds like Todd!""It's a Laugh"" and ""I don't want to lose you"" are typcial H&O; numbers and should be included on the normal compilations. ""Pleasure Beach"" ""Alley Cats"" and ""Blame on Me"" are hard rockers.If you are a real fan of this band you will know that live, they are a hard rocking band. This album represents the live H& O.The only problem with this cd is that when I got mine (about 6-8 years ago) the qulaity of the recording was not as good as it should be. It was not bad but not what you should expect off of a cd."
1,A movie to forget...quickly.,"I have never seen a movie as dull as this. The plot, characters and screenplay are absurd; not because of the concept that in its self could have been good...but because of the sheer stupidity and lack of conciseness and strength used in building these. Dont waste a minute of your precious exsistence on this absurdly bad movie, though in the end, as all extremely stupid movies, it is rather comical to watch. Finally, why be competent in making a movie when it is so easy to be incompetent. Just forget this obnoxious concoction...it is a contamination to your intelligence. - N"
2,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT GIVE US ""THE SONS""","This is a very good show done in Germany, and ""In the Heat of the Night"" is great, but I wish Bill would have included more ""Sons of Champlin"" material. It was refreshing to finally hear one at the very end of the show, ""Everywhere"", but it would have been amazing to hear ""Freedom"", ""Things are Getting Better"", and one or two of the other superb songs off ""Loosen Up Naturally"".In the meantime, there's that amazing DVD with Bill and the rest of Chicago, teaming up with Earth, Wind and Fire- that may sound strange, but trust me, it's superb!But I could have sworn I once saw a clip of the Sons playing live somewhere, and if the overall sound is anything like their live CD (from the '90s?) then ""that"" would be the ultimate Bill Chaplin DVD!"
2,Album of the decade?,"In a sea of mediocrity, Muse has come to show us that rock is alive and well. While previous Muse releases were also excellent- namely, Absolution and Origin of Symmetry- they both suffered from some weak tracks pockmarked in between the great ones.Black Holes and Revelations, however, is almost perfect; it's brash, witty, and gloriously over-the-top. The band flawlessly imbues pop, classical, metal, disco, salsa, electronic, and opera into one grand, sensational album.Musically, this is easily the band's best album, and one that puts most other bands to shame. Thanks to Matt Bellamy's virtuoso musicianship and incredible operatic vocals, Muse's ingenuity outshines many of today's hardest-rocking bands.Get it."
1,Get stand replaced,"I have the same problem with the stand and called Samsung customer support. They are sending me a replacement stand at no cost. How many are being sold with the old defective style stand? Is the replacement stand an improvement over the old one? The monitor itself is great and so is the price but this stand problem reminds me of ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Total rip off,"If you saw Guys Gone Wild then don't waste your time and money on this one. Some of the same guys are in this one as in the first one with no new guys that I recall. There is a longer shower scene with the cute guy from the first one, but that is it. You don't even get to see the two ""big"" guys from the first one. I hope this has cured me from buying these ""movies""."
1,Disappointing Remixes,"I like Book of Love's ""Candy Carol"" album, and I like many of the extended remixes of earlier BoL songs like ""Boy"" and ""You Make Me Feel So Good"", but I found the remixes on this CD to be uninspiring and repetitive. The track list isn't given in Amazon's information, so here it is:1) Counting the Rosaries (Partial Confession Mix) - 4:112) Counting the Rosaries (Full Confession Mix) - 7:583) Counting the Rosaries (Happiness & Love Mix) - 6:174) Sunny Day (Heal Your Positive Body Mix) - 6:045) Counting the Rosaries (Crying Angels Mix) - 5:036) Counting the Rosaries (Album Version) - 3:327) Sunny Day (Single Remix) - 3:48"
1,waste of money,"Stupid game, dont buy it. The story, well you already know it if you seen the movie. Its the corniest game ive ever played. Grafics are exelent, but its just no fun. I got it for christmas,(didnt ask for it) and ive only played it twice."
2,so very pleased,I have been looking forward to having a copy of this to call my own since viewing a friend's. Reading the books only makes the movies better.
2,A Love for Cats,"If you love cats, you will love this book. This photo essay is a beautiful collection of kittens. Not only is it cute, but the photography is truly a work of art."
1,Wha?????,"You know, If I really wanted to, I could take a dump on film and it would be better than this."
1,"Yes, Am Idol Fantasia would be good here!","With her irritatingly squeaky voice, Non-Idol Fantasia Barrino would be an excellent performer in musical. Plus, they have something else in common: Fantasia and this show are both overrated! Ha ha ha!"
1,review,"Okay quality at best--- same content as power of positive thinking , but older content---less up to date."
2,KINDA FRAGILE,"Was using this cable for a few days. The retractable lock snagged the thin wires, and wound up ripping the RCA head off.Sounds great in the stereo, just be careful when extending the cable."
2,Great wire at a great price,A nice heavy gauge wire that's more than sufficient for most home users. I didn't have any problem distinguishing the (+) from (-). There's not much to say about speaker wire except it works as expected and was much cheaper here than at a local electronics store.
2,Make a pot of wedding soup and then read this book!,"Capturing the true essence of what it means to be of Italian-American descent and from Youngstown, Ohio, the author paints a richly moving accout of family life during the first half of the twentieth century. Through laughter and tears, I read about Jo, the protagonist whose faith and strenghth never fail. This ""universal"" story played out in many of the homes on Rose Street or on Dearborn Street where my family history began. We learn from Jo and from our grandparents that the struggle to preserve our family and its heritage provides riches a banker can never count. Their experiences so move and inspire us to hold dear all that is truly important: love, loyalty and a true committment to family."
2,Microwave Splatter Screen,Nice little product that works well in helping to keep my microwave clean. I bought one for my daughter as well.
1,Stay away from this one!!!,"After a quick look around at mobile bases I bought this base even though it had gotten mixed reviews. BIG mistake. No instructions, lots of assembly and the result was way short of my expectations. My 450lb cabinet saw is way too heavy for this base. It sags like an old plow horse. The outboard wheels are way too flimsy. The whole saw leans toward these wheels and the floor lock levers seem way too flimsy. I don't known enough about mobile bases to recommend another brand but I do know this one is not worth the money."
1,Good Sound - BADDDD Durability/1 Year Warranty?,"I used these a couple of days a week. However, I would always ensure they were properly wrapped up. Either way, the black casing on the ends started to retreat, exposing the wires. Now, they will not work at all. And what is worst, I have only had these a little more than a year, so the warranty is not good any more."
1,Also Disappointed,"I agree that this is a design book only. That is fine, but it should not be described as a complete guide. There is no reference to various styles. There is no help to one who is not familiar with yarmulkas either as to size or shape. and the few directions are vague."
1,"Save Yourself, Don't Read This!","This Book, if you can call t that, was absolutely horrible. It took me over a year to finally get through, and I hated every last minute of it!I have read otehr ""End of the Worlld"" novels, including Larry Niven's ""Lucifer's Hammer"" which was grand, but this book was just boring and non-climatic. Sure, while an interesting view of the possible end of the world is shared with us, it was boring, meticulous and just plain rather acking any interesting plot line. If you have been drawn in to reading this book, stop now, don't even consider buying it, it's really not worth it! You can have my copy if you want to read it that bad!"
2,Wow this game rules! Optimus Prime Lives!,"So your cruisin at high speed down this highway and suddenlyyour about to go under an overpass and there he is, Optimus Prime. Bigand beautiful as ever this mighty Autobot is rolling right over your head. You can't stop the feeling that you in some way are an autobot car trying to chase prime down. Well this game rocks and you should probably buy it."
2,Good book,Good book funny lines I can't wait to tell you guys how good the second book will be with the power of the juniors.
2,Tap On Your Window Pane,"You can't have too many Aretha Franklin LPs. The organic sound of her early records, combined with the greatest voice in Soul and Pop music, made for a string of records almost uniformly great.30 GREATEST HITS sweeps through those years, and pulls up short before the embarrassing ""Highway Of Love"" years. Songs like ""Call Me,"" ""You're All I Need,"" and ""Oh Me Oh My"" are perfect gems that you may not have heard before, and ""Until You Come Back To Me"" is one of the all time great forgotten singles."
2,Slow & creepy,"Being scared of spiders, the grandson was a little hesitant at first in playing with it. But after a few minutes we had it going everywhere, and then it was used to combat a remote controlled truck he had also received for Christmas.The spider doesn't do well on carpeted surfaces and operates fairly slow on a hard surface, and it is limited on going over any obstacles in it's path. But, overall it seemed to be a fun gift for him and everyone remarked how creepy it was."
2,I really enjoyed this entire cd. My favorite song is 2nd ke,"My favorite song is 2nd kelly. The first reason is because i like the lyrics and secondly because it sounds damn good for the strip clubs for the male strippers to entertain the women with. For the ladies, trust me on this one, it comes from the experience. Secondly, he has made a well organized cd collection which was well produced."
2,Tasty but salty.,"I bought this for an emergency kit, and I decided to try out the chicken pack. Inside the bag I saw some dried veggies, rice, and some yellow powdery stuff which all looked very similar to those Cup of Noodles that we all used to eat in college. Basically, you pour hot water directly into the bag and let it sit for a while.My initial bite tasted good but it was too salty (hence the four stars). I then removed half of the liquid and poured more hot water in to dilute the salt/seasoning. The second tasting was actually very good. This is definitely not gourmet style food, but it was much better than fast food dining.I would probably recommend packing a spaghetti noodle stainer in your emergency kit to remove some of the salt/seasoning before eating. Too much salt intake will make you thirsty and limited water supply is usually a problem during an emergency."
1,Worked great...for 6 months,"Easy set up. Inexpensive and worked right out of the box...for 6 months. Today, unexplainably lost power and does not work. Beware."
1,superficial at best,Yet another attempt to dissect the gender equality and provide answers. This time with not the quality of thought or substance that went into the Mars v Venus books. Skip the imitation and go for the real thing. Not worth the room it takes up on the bookshelf since it has little substance and is full of cliches.
2,"Nice, but we returned it","We liked this product, but it does not include instructions, so we're not quite sure how to put it on (our previous tub spout was not a slip-on). In the end, we ended up returning this because we found something at the local hardware store that would work better without instructions."
1,It was ok,"I thought it was going to be better then it was , to many weird songs . My daughter got bored right away . If i could of rented it before i bought it believe me i would of never bought this video ."
2,College Worthy,"Have had this product for a little bit and it hasn't let me down! Great product, especially for the price. Holds my 15"" laptop, my smaller art supplies, doesn't add weight, has lots of pockets. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a built-in laptop sleeve, but I'm not going to be picky because of the price and the fact that in general the bag is great. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend, and fellow students."
2,It touched me,Life like and far mind provoking version of forrest gump. Currently my favourite films. The last scene is ingenious and offers hope. Brilliant acting throughout especially victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince).
2,great product,I use this to help me digest food as I had my gallbladder removed. This really does the trick. The price is very good!
2,The best of the C&C series so far,"I really enjoyed C&C, but Red Alert is all in all the best and most engaging of the 3 (including Tiberian Sun) so far. A great game in the Real Time Strategy genre."
2,Must Have!,There is never enough memory on the original cards. This is a must have for those vacation trips and storing pictures.
1,We Returned it!,Lund products are usually very nice and good accessories for trucks. I ordered this one for my husband as a Christmas present for use in a 2004 Full Size Dodge Pickup with a regular box.When the bar was extended to the right length for the width of our pickup it was flimsy and not very strong. The net was not meant to be utilized with the bar extended this far and was too tight to be used to hold anything.The chrome finish is very nice but hard to grab and hold onto to turn and adjust to remove or place in the box. Somehow I had the vision that there was a lever to release the tension but it was a push in the little buttons and turn type.This bar might work good in a SUV rear cargo compartment - like a Durango or Trail Blazer
2,My son loves this video & the bonus train,Great video! My son loves Thomas. This is the 6th DVD I bought for him. I thing this is a great deal. You pretty much buy the DVD and get the train for free. If I purchased the wooden train by itself it would have cost me the same with no DVD. Once I put this DVD on my son grabs his trains and plays with them while watching the DVD over and over and over...I get a lot done while he is occupied. By the way he is only 20 months old and he is learning his colors with Thomas as well as recognizing the numbers on the trains.
1,Biased,"Overall, don't care for her American ""Heritage"" series (although I ended up reading quite a few.) I'll just give the description from the back cover:PIETER - the patriarch. He'd known the pain and pleasure of back-breaking work, and no one could cheat him of the riches and power he reaped - not even his beautiful wife . . . JACOB, who saw the railroad unite East and West, then lived to fight the bitter battles to preserve it . . . Elegant ANTONIA, who climbed to the pinnacle of New York society and ruled the glittering ""400"" . . . Lovely REGINA, forced to marry English nobility, escaped to find happiness in the arms of a wild-hearted Irishman. With ruthless courage and pride, they built an unshakeable dynasty - forged an American empire of passion and steel. It was . . . The Van Rhyne Heritage."
2,Perfect for Winter Weather,"The Columbia Cascadian Trinity Boot is perfect for the winter weather, It is very comfortable and keeps my feet toasty warm."
1,A profound disappointment compared to Nos and Sol Negro,"If you liked Nos and Sol Negro, you may not like this one as much - I didn't. It feels very 1960s tired and hasn't the same energy and life of Rodrigues' first two albums. I listen to those all the time; I won't listen to this one much."
1,Hate it!,"I don't know about all the good and bad points of how this video improves your HDTV because i never got that far. My DVE Blue ray version did not work in my brand new Samsung bdp-3600 player. I got no menue, just a black screen. Checked for update for firmware and there isn't any. So, I don't know what to do with it except post it for sale."
2,Ah-ma-za-zing!,"I use this on myself to help with oversensitivity and my hubby uses it for longer sessions and it works wonders. Make sure you apply enough, but not too much, product and allow a few minutes to take effect. This is a staple in my naughty drawer. :)"
1,pass this one,"This movie is terrible even by bond standards, what was Halle berry thinking? She looks awful in this movie, add some lousy dialogues and a plot that parallels Mission Impossible, you have 'Die Another Day'.Pierce Brosnan is at his worst, He looks totally out of shape.But the music was the worst in this movie, David Arnold showed some promise in Tommorrow Never Dies. But they should start with somebody different, or even go back to Eric Serra.The reason i give this 2 stars is cos, the movie is worth watching just for the 'Aston Martin'. and that too half the time, the damn thing is invisible:)Overall, definitely not worth $..."
2,"""Never Mind that the Water Is Poisoned!""","Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."
1,RandyTV,MORE OUT OF BODY /OUT OF MIND: I bought this book with a true interest in the subject. I found the experience by this individual to be in my opinion a fabrication of his imagination in most events. No real reference to facts or reference to other books on the subject. To me this was more of a SiFi story full of entertaining trips. Perhaps books by this author are more grounded facts that can explain the truth of the experience.
1,Too much abuse/too little magic,What happened between DREAMS UNDERFOOT and MOONLIGHT AND VINES?--the abuse that was so prevalent in IVORY AND HORN has taken over completely. It seems in Newford the only way to discover the magic now is to come from such a crippled and abused background that you can't function in this world anymore. All the stories devolve into subject of the year abuse stories with hints that magic acts as only as a counselor. Add to that mix the titillation of lesbianism from half the stories and one has to wonder where this is going? The magic left Newford because it couldn't take the pain and neither could I.
1,Example codes have too many errors,"I wonder if the authors have actually compiled and run the codes. It simply won't work. Take Chapter 20 (RMI) as an example: 1. In class StockMarket, the line Quote q = (Quote)Naming.lookup(""HelloServer""); should be Quote q = (Quote)Naming.lookup(""///QuoteServer"");2. Class StockMarket should belong to package examples.ch20.bean, not package examples.chap20.bean;"
1,"Crap. Crap, crap","Tried to load this software on two different computers that are top of the line as far and speed and memory. Both computers expereiced major problems but had completey different issues. You have to get a special key on everything they try to advertise as free. None of the support tricks they offered worked. Its buggy to say the least. I'm going to try to get my money back. Nothing worked, and very frustrated."
2,Good and functional,"I have been using this kettle now for over a month.Quite satisfied with the performance. My previous kettle was a Breville too and lasted almost 8 years. Was still working but had developed a leak at the bottom which apparently is to be expected after several years of use.This one is good. I like the blue light that comes on when the water is boiling and the little ring when it shuts off. The button at the top, above the handle makes opening the lid very easy.The only reason for deducting a star from my rating is the shape. Could have been a little more elegant. It looks like cut and sealed from stove pipe. It sits on my kitchen counter so I would have expected a more appealing pitcher form to be pleasing to the eye."
2,THE GREATEST BOOK EVER,"OK, i know i wrote a review before but i have a tons more to tell about the book.First off, for anyone who thinks that their life is heading a for a breakdown, read it. I read it and it inspired me (althought i never thought about it) to write. all my feelings of pain and sorrow vanished. I never felt so good reading a book. Roberta Ritter is the most complez, diverse, down to this earth character ive ever met. i wish ive really met her in this life of mine although i havent. She is the most wonderful person who you'd ever read out. she makes this book that master piece it is and she makes it the most greatest book of all time."
2,Funniest of the Summer,Anchorman is full of hilarious one-liners that will have you on the floor laughing. The combination of Steve Carell and Will Ferrell created non-stop laughter throughout the whole theater. It is by far the best movie of the summer and will surly remain that way.
2,"Thanks, I needed this","If possible, I would like to thank Raymond Franz personally for writing this book! I was of the millions of 'rank and file' he mentioned and there is no way I would ever know what goes on at the core of the Watchtower organization without his sharing this with us. I was looking for an informative, honest viewpoint with an underlying Christian theme of love and I found it in this book. It's too bad that Jehovah's Witnesses aren't allowed to read such a book, but then they would know what the real 'truth' is, wouldn't they?"
1,Do not buy!,"These traps are the biggest piece of junk, I have ever spent hard earned money on. At one time I had two of these things, new out of the box, and neither one worked. I had to return four of these traps before I could get one to work. I constantly have problems getting it to work. It's so bad, none of my friends will shoot with me. My friends just opt to hand pull with their hand pullers, so we can shoot on any given day. These things are complete jokes, and the company knows it. I've called for knew parts on defferent occasions, and received parts that were rusted or completely different, with instructions to rebuild the old trap with the new parts. Please, please do not spend your money. The sad fact is, when I bought these things, they were $500.00!"
2,Attention Cat Lovers!!,"This movie is for the cat lover in us all! Real cats, in an excitingadventure story. Charming and funny, exciting and heart-warming.Anyone who has ever loved a cat beyond reason, will want to see this film!"
2,Applause! Applause! Applause!,"I am honored to call the author a friend. I have also been privileged to view the original manuscript a few years ago. I knew, from my first look at it, that gems such as these would not stay hidden for long.The author (Tony, to me) is one of those rare individuals who possesses a unique talent of word mastery. He says what most of us often think and lack the courage to voice. The initial poems included in ""Anger....."" are reflections of his strength. It takes some kind of courage to look that deeply into oneself and admit frailties and hurt.My favorite, ""Wildflower"", is laced with such tenderness that it evokes feelings of wanting to be loved in just that way.......to be seen and known for the true beauty that I believe true ""women"" possess (even me........smile).Mr. Davis (Tony, to me :-) ) , you have DONE it ! This is a masterpiece. Now........get busy on your next one. Congratulations on a hard work well done.Katrina (Kat, to you)"
1,Too overdone.,"""Strange Bedfellows"" is a very long-winded play concerning the reading of it, and I'd imagine performing it and watching it as an audience member would be the same. When reading, I felt that the two playwrights, Florence Ryerson and Colin Clements, expected the reader to be fully familiar with the history of the Women's Suffrage (do brush up on your history if you plan on reading/seeing this play). And, I felt the ""inside knowledge"" everyone had about the ""certain women"" was barely shared, and I felt left out of the action. To perform if, a lot of stamina would be needed for the actors and actresses, as this is a lengthy play with full costumes and quick dialogue. For audience members, I'd say you need the Cliffs Notes for this time in history, and a great attention span. I so very much wanted to enjoy reading this play dealing with an important time in our history, and I was looking forward to the humor, but I couldn't wait until it was over. I do not recommend."
2,Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter,This presenter has gotten me through several presentations. I had another one for over a year and it was lost. So I just had to get another one! The battery life is great and the timer is very helpful. The presenter is so easy to use. You only have to turn it on and plug it into the USB drive.
1,Krups bombed this time,"We have used Krups products for at least 30 years and have never had an issue with any of them - until now. When we ordered a new coffee maker (coffee and espress side-by-side), it came with this carafe - which lasted about 3 weeks before the plastic thru which a screw attaches the metal ring to the handle/carafe top broke, making the carafe useless as it no longer had either a handle or a cover. We ordered this replacement (I must have been dreaming) thinking maybe we had done something wrong to damage the original. We hadn't. The replacement was as bad as the original, meaning that we have now spent an extra $20.00 replacing a bad product with one just as bad. I do not reccommend this product to anyone and hope the folks at Krups have the sense to improve their quality control before the company's good reputation suffers."
2,Love it!!!,"I told my husband that I was in love again- with my nail gun. I am extremely pleased with this tool. I have look for months into every brand, and asked people that I know about their preferences in nail guns. I decided on this one, and couldn't be happier. It set up quickly and easily. It has cut hours off of my time in nailing moldings and trim on the furniture that I make. I can't believe it took me so long to buy this tool."
2,Brilliant thriller!,"Occasionally I will buy a movie sight unseen, based on reviews. The Gathering is one of those films, and I loved every moment of it. This is a chillingly atmospheric film with a slow build-up to a startling conclusion, much like Sixth Sense. What is sad is that I never heard of this movie before I stumbled across it on Amazon.com. Fans of this genre should not miss The Gathering."
1,Bad experience,The camera was ok but a year later it stopped working out of nowhere.We were told that we would have to pay $250 approximately in order for canon to repeat it.So of course we bought a different camera.
2,pretty good way to kill a few hours,"This movie is a sleeper. Not meaning it is a boring flick, but rather that those looking for something to watch could easily overlook it. The characters, an older bureaucrat and female, ex-felon, are sympathetic due to the pain the flies forth from the story of their individuals lives. In the process of going through the motions, these individuals come to find each other. While you will never be sure they are in love with each other or are simply lonely, you get to watch them attempt to create some type of relationship that can become spiritually fulfilling for each person. In the process, you get to witness some intimate moments, as well as some uncomfortable moments. All in all this becomes a really good movie to enjoy."
1,There is another band with the same name...I got the wrong one.,I was looking for The Clan Destined with Martin Walkyier on Vocals from the metal bands Sabbat and Skyclad. I gave abbra away I think my friend liked it.
1,Hate the book.,"I read this book a long time ago back when it was popular. Thought it was interesting but didn't think much of it since it was too idealistic and written by a guy who didn't have the credentials and experience to back it up. It was overly simplistic and its one size fits all solution didn't sit well with me. Forward to ten years later to now... I have a girlfriend who I'm crazy about but I can't even kiss her because she wants to wait until our wedding day. Great... our 1st kiss together will be in front of 500 people. Thanks a lot. As if our wedding day wouldn't be stressful and awkward enough. Dating advice from a 21 year old? What other book is he going to write about that he has no experience in. He should have a disclaimer that his intended audience is for kids still in high school. ""I kissed common sense goodbye."""
2,Got me off the couch,I had seen some country clogg dancing and thought it was wounderful. So I decided to start my self. Very good dvd to get you stared with the basics.
1,Bowery Boys are Great but the DVDs are Lousy,"I was excited to see 10 of the Bowery Boys/East Side Kids films in a nice box set. I grew up watching these guys on TV and really enjoy their banter and antics. I've viewed a few of these movies so far and I have to write that the DVD quality is horrible, among the worst I've seen. It seems as if the source of these DVDs were really bad VHS tapes. And to add insult to injury, Passport has this bad habit of putting text in the lower right hand corner throughout their DVD films. In these, ""Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids"" appears in light lettering throughout the film, which is very distracting. I had another Passport DVD (""Man with the Golden Arm"") and the Passport logo appeared in the lower right throughout the film also.In conclusion, unless you are a big fan of the Bowery Boys, I would definitely not recommend this set and be wary of all DVDs from Passport."
2,My all time favorite Coffee Maker,"I've owned many coffee makers, this is by far my favorite... I was searching for a replacement and was disappointed to see they don't make one like it anymore...Pros: Keeps coffee Hot. Easy to fill the water tank. Makes really good coffee. Durable. Easy to use.Cons: Almost impossible to pour without spilling a little bit. Takes up half the counter unless you mount it."
1,A no good canopener.,"The on & off switch positivly did not work.After about a week,I got so disgusted with it Ithrew it in the garbage can.Thats what i thinkabout this product."
1,Size is not standard,"I bought 2 shoes from this brand:Stacy Adams Men's Madison 00049 Cap Toe Shoes,Black Kid/Lizard Print,12 DStacy Adams Men's Madison 00049 Cap Toe Shoes,Chestnut Kid/Lizard Print,12 DThe size was not standard, it is larger than the standard size. I paid price, international shipping and customs duty, but It was larger than my size about 1 inch. I do not advice to buy this item online."
2,book with my kid's nickname in it,"haven't read the book, but looked through it, and it looks good, so I give thisa 5 star rating for this book."
2,An old but still good book,"This book has been written before the Internet era. So the author talks about the newspaper and other ways to receive news, but no Internet. However the underlying mathematics is still valid if you extrapolate it for the Internet."
1,Bought two for Christmas and neither worked :(,"I bought two of these (one for each of my daughters) and neither worked. One did nothing when the ATM card was inserted, the other took the ATM card but I could not even set the current data and time in it. It seemed like the keypad was defective.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT!"
2,GREAT FIT!,"Uni has awesome fits, I bought both a hat and a Jealous top. Its comfy, they look great with jeans. It gives you the look of being stylish, but yet casual."
1,"""It doesn't work"" is the kindest thing I can say about this.....","Roxio Easy CD & DVD is anything but easy. That's because it causes my PC to freeze and turns blank disks into trash. Even after I use the Task Manager to close frozen windows, the CD drive is locked shut until I reboot.This PC is less than six months old, and it doesn't have any hard drive or registry issues - at least it didn't before I loaded this software.I'm really kicking myself for not taking a look at these reviews before I purchased this. The Windows Media Center software that came with my PC does it all better anyway.Live and learn.NOT recommended,"
1,Hmmmmm,Greetings: I am a time traveller from the year 1993 and to prove this will be happy to answer any questions from my time!.......That pretty much sums it up (pointless and irrelivent)
1,Package not as promised,"I am a resident of United Arad Emirates and have bought my Playsation 3 from Dubai. However, I do order Blue Rays through Amazon and also check whether they have any Regional restrictions. This trilogy pack, does not mention anything about Regional Restrictions but actually contains one pack (At World's End) which is incompatible to my PS3. But the other 2 films play without any problem at all.I also bought ""Troy"" (which did not mention any regional restriction) and that too plays perfectly on my PS3. My copy of Dark Knight blue ray is on it's way (this too doesnt mention any Regional Restriction) and now I wonder whether that will play on my system !Great disappintment after spending money to get it shipped etc. I guess it is a packaging mistake. I would like Amazon to send me a proper ""Region Free"" disc."
2,Great Calculator: subterranean documentation,"HP produced a great calculator with incredible functionality. The problem is learning how to use the functionality. I have been using online forums to get up to speed on how to do things that should be really documented in the users manual. Something basic like conversions between units should be fully detailed.I am still trying to get the hang on RPN, but it does seem to be very interesting on how it forces you to break your problems down into better digested pieces to solve."
2,Fun Flick,"I am an unabashed Soderbergh fan, but I know there is good Soderbergh and bad Soderbergh. This had the potential to be a real knockout in the Bourne vein, but I don't believe it was aiming for such great heights. This is just a fun movie that is really enjoyable. The music really lets us know that this is fun escapism and the set pieces are really cool. And say what you will but Gina Carino was actually pretty good for someone who is not a professional actress. I can see why its getting the negative reviews it's getting but If you know going in that this movie likes to take it's time I think you can see how much fun it really is."
2,Mariah Carey's Greatest Hits: A Must Have Collection,Mariah Carey is one of the very few artists to put out an album every year since her debut in 1990. This greatest hits collection is the perfect opportunity to get a piece of the magic from most of Carey's past albums all in one. It includes a decade of memorable #1 singles from the biggest selling female artist of all time. Mariah Carey's Greatest Hits is a must have collection for all audiences to enjoy. I highley recommend this one!!!
2,Like a guy I know,"I read this book lying on a beach in Mallorca over the course of two days. It's an easy and amusing read. I liked the main character Wormold. He's so laid back and lets events overtake him and take control of his life. Not unlike a few real life characters I know! Anyone who can ""fall"" into the role of a secret service agent and then believe he can fool them with plans of vacuum cleaner instead of a weapon is clearly off his head. What makes the character funnier is that he thinks that he will get away with it and it is an earnest attempt to fool them that he is doing something meaningful. There is nothing sinister in his deception - just a naive desire to please and get by in life as quietly as possible. As you will find out in this book, the quiet life is something that he fails to achieve.The only reason why it doesn't score 5 points is that it's a bit light weight. It's over all to soon. - Perfect for the beach though."
1,plextor: you do not get what you pay for,"I just wanted to pipe in that I also, was one of those people that had this drive fail on themMy drive was manufactured in February of 2005, and It lasted monthly burns for 370 days, then it failed. It's got a one year warranty, I used it 12 times to burn CD's/DVD's and it fails. Hows that for reliability?! Stay away from this company!Maybe I will give the highly rated Samsung a shot..."
2,Emo - Not Punk,"It seems a lot of people can't tell the difference between emo and punk, and I guess hardcore fans are the only exception. But that's not really the point, except that The Juliana Theory is of the ""emo"" genre, period.""Into the Dark"" and ""We're Nothing Without You"" are songs that pull at the heart, while ""To The Tune of 50,000 Screaming Children"" and ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me"" are fast-paced, if not equally thought-provoking.This CD shouldn't be labeled and aimed at a specific group of people. I know older people (guys included) that listen to and enjoy TJT. There's no limit to who can or should listen to a band or genre of music."
1,Horrible,Not even worth watching for free. Terrible. Horrible. Very Bad. Should never have been made. Waste of time. Crap. Trash. Couldn't even finish it.
2,Great movie!,"All I can say is the kids love it and we do to! It had my son jumping up and down yelling Go, go, go!!! this was at the end with the big dragon! Fun movie!"
1,Fifty Soups,"Somewhat disappointing. a cookbook without pictures is like a coloring book without crayons. The recipes were redundant, I'm glad it was available at no cost."
1,Missing an Essential Defense,"One thing that is blantantly missing in this book is a logical defense of its premise. If the Bible is sufficient for all Christian doctrine, then where in the Bible is the canon of Scripture defined, and where in the Bible is Sola Scriture defined. I can't find it in this book. But we do find it in Protestant traditions. While we're at it, I guess the Holy Spirit got it wrong on the Old Testament canon but right on the NT canon? How can that be?"
1,Good but not great,"I got this CD this past weekend and listened to it for a couple of days on and off and nothing really grabbed me. To me most of the songs sounded like songs from his last CD. There were a couple of songs that were catchy but ironically they are cover songs. KWS is a great guitar player and puts on a great show live, but his CD's just don't do anything for me."
2,Wonderful!,"This a great workout if you have only 45 min and I think that the description is misleading. Most people will think they would not be able to get much for the 10 min segments but trust me, they are all fiery and you really feel like you have seriously worked out afterwards. Jeanette is her usual bubbly self and guides you through a wonderful 45 min which makes you sweat and feel wonderful afterwards. A great buy!"
2,I actually enjoy the aerobics!,"This was my first Karen Voight video, and I love it! I am not a big fan of aerobics (I hate to sweat!), but I really enjoy this routine. Mostly I like Karen. She gets me motivated to work hard, even though I have to pull out the towel and turn on the fan. :) I also love the bodyscultping section. I can feel the burn, and it's a great all over workout. I don't do both sections in one session, simply because after aerobics I can't concentrate on more focused moves like weights. Karen is one of my favorite two instructors, and I would definitely recommend this video."
2,solid,had a couple signal problems but they have stopped. Super useful cable when your cpu doesn't have an hdmi out.
2,good greenies,"Our girls have to have their Greenies before bedtime. They are 30 and 40 lb border collies, but we give them the Teenie Greenies, sometimes two, they go NUTS over them!"
2,A success,"Stephen Gately, formerly of Ireland's Boyzone starts a solo career. This song is one of his single's and it's such a great song. I love it. It starts off slow, making you believe that it's a ballad, but then it becomes up-tempo with a really good beat that makes you want to tap your feet or even get up and dance. What I've gotten from this song is that it's kinda his way of letting the public that he's ready for a ""new beginning"" away from Boyzone. Two thumbs up!"
2,Helped Me Get Rid of Back Pain - Permanently,"I bought this book while I was on my way towards improving my lower back pain. At that time I was exercising hard, I had already lost a good amount of body fat, but the pain kept coming back every once in a while. All I did was introduce some of the anti-inflammatory foods in my diet, reduce or eliminate the oness that were highly inflammatory, and in a matter of months, the pain was gone. I'd say it's a pretty good result after over 20 years of pain. Now I can work out hard, play tennis, table tennis, do high intensity interval training, without any pain whatsoever. Just to make one thing clear - I don't see this book as a guide to a diet that you can go on and once you're done you go back to eating the stuff that's bad for you. The way I see it, the food choices, recipes and resources from the Inflammation Free Diet Book are meant to help you make long-term diet changes that will significantly improve the quality of the rest of your life."
2,Good learning tool for preschoolers,"I bought this game for my daughter who just turned 5 and got the L-Max for Christmas. She loves playing this game, and in addition to helping her master number recognition, this game helps her motor skills and hand/eye coordination. My daughter (who is very active) will sit quietly and play this game for long stretches at a time, allowing me to finish whatever project I'm working on. I feel good knowing she's learning and not just being babysat by technology. This was a really good purchase for my family."
1,Does not work,"Very well constructed and cute to look at, my kids loved it until they discovered they could not make it bounce. It takes a lot of effort to get it to move. My two year old lost interest very quickly, even my 6 year old could not move it. I am hoping to return this or exchange it, it does not do what it's supposed to, the age range is 2-5 years, and no child of this age will be able to get this thing to move unless they are very heavy and aggressive with it. A total piece of crap, don't waste your money. Buy them a Little Tykes push along car or something instead."
2,The Bird Soars High and far !!!,The wave bird controller is not heavy at all. It can send its signal through 6 walls! This is a very important controller for all big gamers. The wavebird does not require its own memory card. It also has channels so you can have multiple controllers. I love the Wavebird controller.
2,SRV Live @ Montreux,"Well done. An interesting insight into the early ambitious young player and the following return to Montreux, and a more secure and more established player. The turnaround is much like his musical style, forever relentless and pressing forth... in spite of the weather."
1,Babylon5-The Lost Tales,I absolutely loved the series but this new 'movie' stinks so bad I think I want a refund. Boring! ANYONE who says they liked it must work for theproduction company.
2,Long Life!,"I have almost the same watch, except that I purchased it a good 15 years ago. Although I have not treated it well, it has rewarded me with a long life and excellent performance. It keeps perfect time, so I only reset it at the beginning and end of Daylight Savings Time or when I go to a different time zone (which is rare). A few years ago, I thought it needed to be repaired. I took the watch to the watch repair shop, and they informed me that it only needed a new battery. They were right. Other than the occasional band cleaning, that is the extent of the maintenance this watch has required for 15 years.My only disappointment is that, like a another reviewer mentioned, Wenger has changed the model to a white face. I prefer the black face that I have, now. It just looks better with the steel (white looks better with either gold or something dark). So, I knocked off a star for appearance (only). For performance, this guy gets five stars and then some."
2,EXCELLENT MEDICAL THRILLER,GREAT LEAD CHARACTERS DRIVE THIS BOOK. I COULD NOT PULL MYSELF AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AFTER THE SECOND CHAPTER. IF YOU GET PAST THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS WITH ALL THE MEDICAL JARGON YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK AS I DID. YOU WILL ALSO WANT TO MEET MAKS.
2,Pretty good book,"This book is pretty good for the pet owner that is interested in the well being of their pet. I agree with other reviewers that the jargon used in this book may be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with chiropractic. The only downside to the book is a little bit of ranting and conspiracy theory done by the author that gets a little old, but it is not that big of a downer. Altogether, this is an excellent book and provides some excellent information."
2,This cartoon rocks!,"This is a cartoon about four planets (fire, rock, ice and bone) coming together as one to defend their solar system against the beast planet. This cartoon has great animation and action."
2,Absolutely hilarious!,"This is a great story with a strong, smart heroine. The one-liners are subtle but laugh-out-loud funny. Tiffany Trott is a most entertaining read....this is my favorite of the British-chick genre. I also recommend the Shopaholic books by Sophie Kinsella."
2,Hanoi does ROCK,"This album Rocks. This is the one to get. Ive been listening to this album since around 1985 and it rocks. The drummer of the band ""Razzle"" was the guy that was with Vince Neil who got killed in the DUI accident. Anyway ive listened to their other albums but this one is the best. If I had to pick 10 records (cd's) to be on an island by myself forever This one would be highly concidered as one of them. Thats how I rate my music."
1,Booooooring,"I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors."
1,Awful,"I bought the Kindle because of the reviews here seem more positive than negative (though I realize that elsewhere reviews of the Kindle are not very good).I returned it and bought a Sony reader instead where I can read doc, pdf, epub, etc files. With the Kindle, I can't. I spent days trying to figure out how to do this and in the end given up. I've always been an Amazon fan because of their wide stock in books and other items, but if only their Kindle doesnt have that dreadful DRM then it would probably be at par with the other readers on offer in the market. And also, the Kindle is waaay to expensive for what it is. I did not want to buy ebooks from Amazon and store in the 'clouds' with my Kindle. With Sony, I can store in my computer and the reader.Amazon just has to get rid of that DRM!!!"
2,American Orthodoxy is greatly indebted to Fr. Seraphim,"While so many Orthodox theologians in Fr. Seraphim's day were writing left-leaning works that looked as though they had come from Vatican II, monk Seraphim was earnestly laboring to bequeath to the tiny American Orthodox flock the rich patristic inheritance of the Church.The Soul After Death's chapters upon the tollhouses contains large quotations of St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Macarius of Egypt, St. Leo of Rome, and St. Mark of Ephesus. Those who slander Fr. Seraphim and these teachings are usually from the school of one Mr. Puhalo, who deeply resented Fr. Seraphim's vast influence upon Orthodox Christians of America, Russia, Greece, and elsewhere.Fr. Seraphim was a great luminary of the Orthodox Church who truly struggled for Orthodoxy. You will not be disappointed with this easily readable, insightful volume."
1,It will probably will not fit your cabinet,I bought it. It designed for doors that do not close on a frame. This means - it not relevant for most doors I know. In other words - not a standard dimension.
1,"Beware, this is the Special Edition","That other guy doesn't know what he is talking about. This is not the REAL Star Wars. I mistakenly purchased these videos and found out that they have all the horrible added scenes and Lucas ""special touches"". Do not buy this if you are looking for the untouched version of Star Wars!"
1,Customer abuse,"The game itself is OK--not great, mind you, but OK. But to be unable to play a piece of software that I paid a lot of good money for until I get up from my computer, track down the disk, insert it, take it out, put it back on the shelf, etc., etc., is such abominable customer abuse that I've now had enough! I refuse to play this game anymore and will NEVER buy a Chessmaster game again. I find it incredible that so many people are willing to put up with this garbage! I have scores of software disks I've bought over the years and Ubisoft is the ONLY one that makes me prove over and over again that I'm not cheating them out of their money. Do NOT buy this game unless you think this gross customer abuse is the way things should be!"
1,Not that great!,"If you are needing significant humidity. This device will not produce it. I grow mushrooms and was using this device in a mini greenhouse (small). It has been sealed all the way around and has very minimal air leakage. Standing alone the humidity is maintained at 60%. The device did raise it to 70% and would hold but I need at least 80 to 85% humidity. Maybe, I was expecting to much...I don't think so. The item was hyped and failed to produce the results. Plus... you could make this thing yourself with a quick trip to Ace Hardware and about $5.00!"
2,"Very funny, IF...","...you know a bit about Irish literary history and are willing to put up with a very, um, fractured plot. Unless you know about, for example, the story of the Madness of King Sweeney, the book might not work as well for you. However, my main reason in writing this is to point out something about the editorial review:This book was NOT published a year before Ulysses. That's silly. Ulysses had been published over 20 years previously, I think. Thank you."
2,A quiet revolution!,"""Recovery from Childhood in America"" is radical in the true sense of the word: It goes to the root of the being human problems of anxiety, self loathing, hate, and violence. And not just in a theoretical discourse, but by proposing simple clear steps and exercises one can take to eliminate the source of unhappiness from one's life. Doesn't pychotherapy of all kinds propose that? Yes, but it can't deliver because it's message is incomplete and really only half formed. As one who has tried many types of therapy in my search for happiness, and found them leaving me with a ""now what"" feeling, I find relief in her method; an answer that works simply and beautifully. I am grateful she wrote this book, that I discovered it, and that it works for me. If you get this book and do what is suggested you will have all the psychic and spiritual tools you will ever need."
2,Great blu ray movie,"Awesome price, fast shipping, A great way to expand your collection without going broke. Awesome internet seller! A++ Thank you"
1,"awful, waste of plastic","In just a couple months, I have gone through at least 5 of these--I'm lucky that my local bike shop has let me swap them out each time they break. The only positive is that they hold my klean kanteens perfectly. But, they break SO easily. They just snap, and when the first one broke, i though I had overtightened it. And then 4 more broke. I'm still trying to find a good cage for Klean kanteens."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This item was the biggest waste of moeny!! I bought it at 24 weeks gestation and am now 34 weeks along and have been ATTEMPTING to use it faithfully...but all I hear is my stomach gurgling (big whoop) and my hearbeat. And, the headset is now starting to go out on it. Since it is a 'personal product' they don't offer a money back guarantee. Pay the extra money to rent a medical doppler and you'll be happier."
2,A Real Taste of Ireland,"I was given a subscription as a gift back in 1995 and have been receiving this publication ever since.The articles are varied and extremely well written. You'll find subjects as predictable as the life of St Patrick and how Waterford crystal is made to how bogs are formed and the treasures that lie within them. The photography will make you want to visit every square inch of the country and you'll think the colors have been enhanced by computer but, if you go, you'll find they are true to life!One of my favorite regular articles is by Christopher Moriarty who suggests interesting travel on Ireland's lesser known roads in Byways rather than Highways. You can (and I do) use these ideas for trips around the country while finding out interesting facts about places most tour buses pass quickly by.I look forward every other month to finding this magazine in the mail. Subscriptions for other magazines have come and gone but this is one I'll be getting for a long time coming."
2,Amazing little (ugly) device,"I am a bit of a coffee snob, so I'd like to get that out there straightaway. This little thing hasn't made me a bad cup of coffee yet. Even with some Blonde roast coffee that I do believe is terrible, it made a nice cup of coffee. It won't do ""espresso"" or ""french press"" coffee, as those require specialized devices for proper extraction. This will, however, make a great cup of black coffee or an espresso-strength 2oz of coffee. Filters are cheap, the AeroPress is easy to use and clean, and you can have fun experimenting with water temperature, grind, and press time/force. I travel with this and use it at the office with an electric kettle. Easier and cleaner than pourover, and easy for other people to use, even for the first time. If you are already thinking about getting one, I highly doubt that you will regret buying one of these."
1,Lame,Seemed to be aimed at a person that doesn't know much about flying. Maybe you should wait to get your multiengine rating if you're at that level.
2,Proud SpiritReview,excellent stories depicting the abuse and horror horses have experienced only to become alive and happy once again through the TLC provided at horse sanctuaries.
1,DOA ! (Dead On Arrival),"Received this pump (S/N 2065) today. It would not run. Problem was traced to the GFI (ground-fault-interrupter) plug, which was inoperative. Replaced with a normal plug and the pump now runs.Upon disassembly the inside of the GFI plug is found to charred and smells of cooked electrical.I will use this pump with my replacement plug. This is easier than returning it."
2,Works exactly as described,"I have found this splitter to be very useful during the past few weeks I have owned it. It is great when you want to share your ipod music with another person, or for watching a movie or webchatting with two people on one computer. Great price for what you get."
1,Difficult installation,"OK quality of the speaker itself, but the installation method is horrible. The little screw locks are poorly designed. There should have been longer screws or something to keep the wall/screw locks from falling off inside the wall. Once you install the speaker there is no going back, you can not manuver the screw locks into a position to take the speaker out of the wall. I would research other speakers to find ones with a better thought out installation process."
2,An office necessity.,"I have owned the clip-on type of this Air King 6"" fan for awhile and decided I could also use a table type to put on top of my computer tower. Don't know how I got along without this fan. It is quieter than a whisper and performs well with two speeds of airflow. One negligable drawback is that it takes two hands to turn it on and off; the unit could use a push-button switch. Over all a very good deal for the comfort it provides. The price was right and the item was shipped to my door, no lengthy shopping trip needed. Prepare for a grounded three-prong plug, OK?"
2,Top Quality Denso OEM O2 sensor for Volvo,Denso makes top Quality Sensors. This was a direct fit replacementfor a Volvo V70 as the upstream (pre-Cat) sensor.It appears this is a wideband type sensor. More costly than otherbrands but works well and the engine control computer is happy.
2,Assembly is tricky -but great buy,"The other write-up is correct - the directions are not the greatest, but I was able to put it together myself. I did have to have my husband tighten everything and put in the last 2 screws, but it was a good buy for the price, and now the golf bags have a place!"
2,Little Brother,"Wow...was I ever surprised when I checked out this disc. These guys are amazing, especially the production by 9th Wonder, which reminds me of a mix between Kanye West and No ID. The MCs are dope as well...check it out."
2,Midsize easy reader,"If this watch is the "" mid-size "" easy reader, I think the large one would be too big for anyone's wrist . I like big watches so this one is perfect for me ."
2,Perfic Notebook,you already know what it's specs are so i won't bother writing about that. Not only does these notebook loke good but it has the best processor(AMD Athlon 4). It's the most powerful for a laptop due to Pentium 4 does not run on such a thin laptop.Price is GOOD AND THESE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RATED 10/5(SOME HOW?)
2,An overview--not for in-depth study,"This book is a general overview of the Forex market, including its history. All the information contained in the book is helpful, but it teaches neither the various economic factors that have fundamental effects on the currency markets, nor the technicals involving day-to-day trading. If I wanted to buy one book to get a general idea of what everyone is talking about, this would be it. It is also an easy read for a short afternoon."
2,Great for Dogs,"Great as a supplement for my dogs. This has helped to aid their hair growth after a long and grueling fight with fleas. They went from having barely any hair in certain places. To now having overgrown hair. But I don't mind they can always be groomed. Also if your afraid of your animal not liking it don't worry. One of my dogs has become very aware that I add things to her food including vitamins and flea medication. So she will simply scoop out the food with her mouth and examine what she is eating before chewing and swallowing it. Even though she look at it she always eats it. I think they like the oil inside. Either way i'm happy. Give this to your dog for sure, for hair growth and over all wellness. They'll thank you with their health and happiness."
2,QUESTION: Blu-Ray?,"Does anyone have any word on when this classic might make it to Blu-Ray?I'm also hoping that when the blu-ray does eventually make it we might get all released of the film, not just the new censored one."
2,MILES DAVIS' FIRST COLUMBIA RECORD,"'Round About Midnight was Miles Davis' Columbia debut LP and one of his calmest recordings ever. The first song 'Round Midnight is an excellent old '50s song, recorded on 9/10/1956. The next song which was the first session Ah-Leu-Cha is excellent, recorded on 10/26/1955. All of You and Bye Bye Blackbird have really great piano. Bye Bye Blackbird is my favorite song here, it has the best piano. All the songs in this album are excellent as well as other Miles Davis. Get this with Kind of Blue and you can enjoy a relaxing late 1950s."
2,"Slight as a Summer breeze, and just as pleasant","Summer Things/Embrassez Quiz Vous Voudrez is one of those films that probably shouldn't really work but does. Based on a British novel by Joseph Connolly following various middle class characters (upwardly and downwardly mobile) on a holiday that takes in various affairs, jealousies and suicide attempts, it's a light confection that works surprisingly well, not least because people DON'T do the right thing (when estate agent Jacques Dutronc finds out an employee has reduced the price on a desperately short of cash friend's house for a backhander, he does nothing to rectify the situation). Much of what happens is fairly predictable, with the exception of Charlotte Rampling keeping her clothes on for once, but the performances are strong and Michel Blanc's direction keeps it all on track. Nothing profound, but surprisingly likeable.Extras are fairly light - just a trailer and a photo montage with an audio essay by the director."
2,Very happy with the product,"Having never used a food processor before, I wasn't sure what to expect but have been very happy with the product. The VHS tape included was very helpful. Another item which would be great is a storage case for the tools not in use. The blades are extremely sharp so you can't just leave them lying around."
2,Cannot go wrong with Victorinox!,"Ever since I started purchasing Victorinox knives I have absolutely enjoyed all their top quality products. This multi-tool is no different. Solid, well-crafted workmanship. The tool is well designed and easy to use. I repair a great deal of computer and electronic equipment and this has been an invaluable piece to carry with me always. I really like that it came with a very nice leather belt pouch. Would recommend this item or any others by Victorinox."
1,Friction,I am sorry to say that everyone I have used this on has stated that it felt like it was being dragged along their skin causing a friction effect. Might go for the more expensive cover. Hopefully that will feel better to them!
1,WHAT'S UP PLAYBOY?,"The film takes place in MIA and uses a lot of street language as the make the ice so they can get the paper or cheese. The movie looks like an HBO street documentary with poor camera angles and talking to people like ""Whypp"" ""Pyg"" ""Dog"" or ""Mooch."" But clearly it is not a real street film as the camera shows you both ends of a telephone conversation. The plot involves some home boys dealing drugs in the street, telling the guys that work for them they owe them for all the drugs no matter what happens. It feigns some politically commentary when it mentions the disparity of jail time for crack vs. cocaine.There are drug deals gone bad, deals with Latinos and a ""cracker"" but no real plot, just a slice of life. No character build-up and minimal plot.Written, directed, produced, music score by and starring Tony Mashino.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity."
2,Enlightening,"This book makes you feel good about being ""gifted"" - you know you aren't the only one around in that situation. A lot of nice examples, and it's very uplifting. Too bad it couldn't cover overseas examples though."
2,gift,gave to best friend as a gift. She is enjoying it and the study is helping her get through the prayers!
1,Total lack of detail,"The book constains too little useful information both for newbie and for experienced administrator. The author is running through the different parts without in-depth explanation or practically useful information. The only reasonable part is Chapter 1 which covers HP-UX installation. I bought this book as preparation tool for HP-UX test but it won't work. Also, about 1/2 of the boot itself consists of hardcopy of man pages. Probably this is the most expensive you to print the man pages. Conclusion - don't waste money on this book, use the books from LDP, HP Instant Information CD or buy ""Unix System Administration Handbook"" by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein - the best overview of UNIX and it's flavours I have ever seen."
1,Worthless,Why doesn't Amazon get rid of this page? You can't preview the music nor buy the recording on its site.
2,Sit back and enjoy the mood,Of all the vinyl I bought in the 60s and 70s this is the one I remember best. Perfect to sit back and listen to alone or with someone special. Sip a hot cup of tea and let the best of classical music wash over you with the sounds of a San Francisco thunder shower in the background in perfect sync with the music. If my original vinyl hadn't finally worn out I would still be listening to it. The CD doesn't have the nostalgia of vinyl but it sounds as good as I remember.
1,"Based on hearsay, opinion, and ""psycho-analysis""","This book lacked depth and seemed to be based largely on hearsay and opinion of key people interviewed by the author. At several points, the author even asked some interviewees to comment on what they thought Hillary and/or Bill Clinton were ""feeling."" There are several attempts at a ""psychoanalysis"" of the Clintons, which would have been fine if this was a psychology book written by a psychologist, but doesn't work here at all. With any biography, I question the level of accuracy and also realize that much needs to be based on judgement or interpretation of fact; this book did not seem to present much information based on fact but rather more on unexamined opinion. Overall, a disappointing book."
2,A little R & R...,This is such relaxing music... I most certainly hope that there are more albums on the way. It's only a matter of time before this music becomes very popular...
2,Western tale,"This is a very creative but depressing book, but with a great and happy ending. This book isn't your normal cinderalla story type book, but it is about a woman who is in the time of when men and women were looked at differently, and had totally different jobs. It was unheard of when a male did what a woman generally did or when a woman did what a man generally did. Samantha (main character) is hated by her father for not being the son he had always wanted. She turns out to be a really powerful woman despite the era of time that she is living in. Samantha gets a job as the town sheriff, and with the job comes great responsibility. While she is sheriff, she goes on many adventures while also learning that the father is a bad guy. Thankfully, Samantha finds a man who loves and respects her as the woman she is. This is a great book for anybody who likes old western books with a twist or a romance novel."
2,Beautiful picture,1080p video looks fantastic on this player. Sometimes the player says unsupported video and audio and I have to turn it on and off again. That is a pain. It must be a glitch in the software. HD DVD is far superior to regular DVD.
2,Garmin portable dashboard mount-excellent product,"The portable friction mount works extremely well. It is very stable, easily moveable and unobtrusive. It is particularly good for our Prius, in which it would be very difficult to use any other type of mount given the configuration of the dashboard."
1,Speculative pseudo-history at its worst,"The mystery of Rennes-le-Chateaux is undoubtably facinating, but that's no excuse for producing something as poor as this. It's by now totally discredited (I saw it described as a ""notorious hoax"" in the Observer a while back), especially since being torn to shreds by TimeWatch (a British History program), during which the authors were shown to have not made any attempt to check some of the most basic facts underlying their theories. Strictly for the gullible."
1,Just a bad book,"Oh yuck. I did not know this was a series. Does not matter. Horrible dialogue. Unreal and totally unrelateable characters. I have seen this authors books many places. I thought she might be credible. I read Harlequin romances when I was a young teen. They had more plot than this trite awful book! No plot, no suspense. I did not care. Just horrible!"
2,An under estimate,"David Shepard told you this looks good. Ah, what a load of crap. IT LOOKS FABULOUS! Buy it now! Because you don't need me to tell you what this is about; end of review."
1,"Great to make techno mixes, but poor in other areas","I'm a web designer and I work with Flash, and I was looking for sounds I could use for sites. It claims to have lots of button sounds but I'm yet to find some. The .wav files are named with numbers, so there no way to search with keywords. You have to explore the CD and listen to each .wav file not knowing what you will get.But, it is great for making your own techno mixes. You can take bass loops, drum loops ect and mix them together and ajust the levels etc.I guess the search is still on for sofware or a site to provide me with lots of cool sounds for buttons, mouseovers, etc."
1,Poor design -- Ride-On is not so steady,Both my boys tried to ride this over and over with the same results. The ride-on is balanced so that a little too much pressure on the handle bars sends the kids over face first into the floor. I got tired of bruised faces and crying kids and got rid of it. Definitely disappointing.
2,Top 5 of all time...,"This game is fantastic, what's not to love? A little Disney, a little Final Fantasy, absolutely amazing music! I've never met anyone who didn't love this game!"
1,There was no .1 stars option,"As one would expect, Al Franken's new book is ""bad enough, it's dumb enough, and gosh darnit, nobody likes it!"" Franken again regurgitates a string of tired-out, false interpretations of loose facts that he overheard around the Closet Homosexuals of America mineral-water cooler. Franken's argument lacks insight, due diligence, anything resembling research, and lots of material that would be funny to anyone who was born and raised in solitary confinement. Liberals, this is the book for you. Just senseless enough to make you instantly buy it and canonize it. Enjoy, you muttonheaded socialists."
1,Hmm a little ticked off,"My copy just arrived today, and it has a totally different cover from the one advertised on here.I personally really like it, its quite creepy, and gruesome, but this may bother others.Also the running time on imdb says 99min, and its advertised on here as 100min, and mine says 96min.. so im hoping that this isnt some weird cut version.I live in australia, and i went out of my way to order the unrated region 1 version, because it was 1 minute OVER the running time, and the region 4 (australian) copy says 97min, which is 2 minutes UNDER the running time.And as a result i end up with a version thats could very well be cut by either 3 or 4 minutes? Not cool amazon..I hope i didnt waste my money..Im giving 2 stars, because the artwork on the cover (that i recieved, not sure about the rest of you) impressed me, but having a complete and uncut version is whats most important to me."
1,The only thing Big K didn't mention . . .,. . . that you might want to know is that the girls don't get naked. They are topless.
2,Wonderful Carseat....,"This is a great carseat. I bought it because it has the extra detachable seat pad. Haven't had to use it, but it always happens a diaper overflows at an inconvenient time and I could remove the cushion and contiune to use the seat. It is kind of heavy. I have no trouble loading it in my truck. The seat is very simple to install with the latch. Its more difficult with a seatbelt, but overall we love the seat and would absolutely recommend it. The only reason it didn't get a 5 was because of weight and when the time come to move the straps higher I will have to unscrew the back to access the straps. (Not totally a bad thing because I have a curious 2 year old and I like she can't play with the straps)."
1,Great shows but why only 2 and not the whole season?,Lets be realistic. Why is that all other shows are going the route of a one price/ whole season dvd system? It's fair to the consumer and a cash cow for the producers and retailers. However why does farscape decide to grab their loyal viewers by the ankles and shake them until all their money falls out of their pockets? It just doesn't make sense. They won't get anymore of my money until they change their system. Do the same and hopefully we will all get rewarded with a clean and easy purchasing system and a fair price. The shows are great but at this price and this system they are worth the wait.
1,"Straight out of ""How to Exploit Trends""","Aagh! More simpleton rock. Completely unoriginal riffs, poor instrumentation, and stupid-arse lyrics make up the grung wannabes of Puddle of Mudd, the most accurate band name around. It's sad that rip-offs like these guys, Nickelback, Creed, and others get all the attention while other grunge-influenced, yet far more imaginative, original bands like Local H and modern Days of the New (Travis Meeks is a musical genius) are given the shaft. POM's lyrics are nowhere near as poetic as Kurt Cobain's, Eddie Vedder's, Layne Staley's (God rest his soul), and Chris Cornell's lyrics, nor is the instrumentation anywhere near such bands either. These guys will be nowhere five years from now. They're an example of all that's wrong with modern rock. Boooooooo!!!!"
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this wallet is poor. I would not have bought it if I had a chance to touch it before buying. The zipper does not close smoothly; the leather looks just barely leather; it has a bad smell; glue is visible in some places; the finishing is rough. Generally the workmanship is of the lowest quality; I gave it 2 stars as it just might be the best you can get for this price, and because it fits all my cards."
1,What garbage!,"In deference to my longstanding crush on Patrick Stewart, my husband gave this to me as a joke, and a joke it is! If I were to gather up a pile of fanzines, tabloids and talk show video clips, I could have written this book (although I hope I would have proofread it a little better. The typos are legion.) The ""authors"" did nothing except cut and paste previously published material -- no additional research or interviews went into producing it. Faithfully repeating what Mr. Stewart said to Jay Leno is about as insightful as it gets. All my Amazon pals who gave this 5 stars might want to try reading a real biography some time!"
1,Potentially Bootleg,"I was fishing around trying to find a customer review for this film, and what I found disappointed and disturbed me. The only review I found said (a) the quality was not very good, having been described as a ""16mm film transfer"", and (b) it's bootleg besides. I think Amazon might want to take this item off the website, especially if (b) is true."
1,The Point Of This Album Is....,Who knows? Nobody wants to hear these songs for AT LEAST 6 years. Why would I want to hear songs I've heard a kabajillion times over and over? Moreover REMIXES...which aren't that good anyways. The songs are played out right now to the point of being annoying. We don't want to hear ANY of these songs for a long time coming. Nelly should just drop a new album and be done with it because he has enough catchy jingles to last a lifetime. Oh yeah... NO MORE REMIX ALBUMS for you Nelly!
1,Self-destructed after 1 week; Performance only fair,"Consistent with other reviews on the HDW-2, the plastic ear loop will break no matter how well you care for it. Until Nokia redesigns this part and/or improves customer service, I would strongly recommend against purchasing the HDW-2. Calling Nokia customer service is very frustrating since the consumer pays to return the original defective parts and then must wait for a replacement. Clearly Nokia is unwilling to directly address this problem. Otherwise performance of the HDW-2 is fair. Reception is reasonably good with some intermittent static. Occasionally, the phone and HDW-2 will lose their connection for no apparent reason."
1,"Nero PhotoShow fun to use, but.....","Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4 is fun and easy to use, but I didn't find it more useable or having more features than the one I had previously downloaded for free on the Nero site. I had hoped to have a program that I could use to create slide shows and save them on a CD, but that was not the case. They still have to be uploaded to Nero's website and then CD's are available for purchase to viewers who want them. I don't want to have to pay for a photo show that I already purchased a program to create. I would not recommend this program when a program providing the same options can be downloaded for free on the internet."
2,DGS-2208 - Good solution for inexpensive gigabit,"The D-Link DGS-2208 is a good solution for upgrading to inexpensive to gigabit capability. Requires that NICs be gigabit capable to take advantage of increased bandwidth, otherwise the switched connections will remain at legacy 100 megabit bandwidths."
1,7 bucks for this mouse pad !!! not worth it,"7 bucks for this mouse pad !!! not worth it alltoo expensive in my idea.it's very slim, it's made from hard slim plastic , it's not made of fabricI am used too the fabric material."
2,love it,"I love the back buddy. I have shoulder, hip, neck and low back pain issues almost everyday due to laborious job for 10 yrs now. This tool is very handy, I use it a few times a week at minimum. Can be used in the hot tub too. Very affordable for what money I save by not needing to rush to the chiropractor or for massage, helps my body last longer between doc. visits. I would definitely recommend to anyone."
2,"great recipes, poor construction.","I love the cookbook and have found it immensely helpful in terms of feeding a family of four. However, I wish that it was put together a bit more carefully as the cover has torn off after only a year of use. More solid construction of the book, especially if little ones are using it, would make sense."
1,"slow gameplay, some glitches","I found Star Wars fun at first but its lasting appeal died off fast and the levels and gameplay were very slow. There were a couple annoying gltches, including a menu glitch which made it impossible to read the menu. Finally the graphics are not so good. Not very impressive for a lucas arts game. But if you are a die hard star wars fan it would be a pretty fun game."
2,This is not that bad.,"I missed Teknoman when it originally aired in the States, but I was introduced to it via Tekkaman Blade II, and then, Wikipedia when I tried to find the original.As someone who saw a more.. shall we say, faithfully translated.. branch before I saw Teknoman, I can say that while the name changes are annoying to a point it doesn't change my enjoyment of these collections! I still want the Japanese-only subbed version (I have season 1) but I like being able to get the gist of the original story without having to wade through it all.Purists will find a lot to pick apart - heck, even I do - but I still recommend them. :)"
2,good rechargeables,It is good to see my son enjoying to play with the cars that still have power after two weeks.
1,"Misleading, Wrong, Oversimplified...","The author confuses game theory with decision theory. The model has nothing related with game theory in it. The author defines the whole market as a game between the speculator and the remaining market, but does not take the remaining market's (the second player's) utility into consideration. Therefore the market's strategies are not utility-dependent but history-dependent which contradicts with the notion of game theory. This makes the model a simple choice selection of the speculator from just two alternatives faced with a market-move guess, not an equilibrium analysis as should be in a game-theoretic approach. Simply DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY by buying this book, and if you don't know much about game theory, don't read this book even if it was for free as you will misunderstand what game theory is."
2,This is a good cage,"Assuming all Guinea Pig owners give their pets LOTS of floor time, there really is not a problem with this cage. My piggie roams around my apartment like a dog and I just put him in his cage when I'm at work or sleeping. I don't recommend this cage if you don't let your pet out very often. It's very easy to clean and put together (I did not need the directions). The My Super Pet name tag is a plus. :)"
2,Fun family entertainment,This movie was great fun. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy. I regret not going to the theater to see this on the big screen. A good fairy tail with a not so helpless Princess.
2,Excellent reference for the person considering medium format,This is an excellent book for the novice considering moving to medium format. Goes in to detail on available options in this format. Has some good tips and tricks. Emphasis on high end equipment like Rollei and Hasselblad. Next to nothing on Mamiya. Not a must for those already familiar with medium format equipment.
2,Numb,"Not a bad record, certainly far better than Pop. Numb is the best track, by far. The rest are mid-tier U2 fodder. Unlike Actung Baby, this CD now sounds dated. Probably for big U2 fans only."
2,ANGELS ON EARTH!,"I love this book. I have read numerous self-help, and spiritual books, but this one is written by an earth angel. For years, I feared writing down my goals because I wasn't clear about what I wanted or how to accomplish them. I just finished writing down my goals, and am preparing to launch my celestial experts. Hiring the Heavens has helped me become clear in every area of my life. It is simple, fun, and creative. Thank you Ms. Slatter!"
2,My son loves this book!,"My son loves this book, thinking about getting him the rest of the series. Great artwork , great story, just an all around good book."
1,not the same,"while these are the only one I have found.They are NO where near the Quality, of what they used to be !the metal that forms the window glass clamp is so thin it will not even stay on the glass.another example of inferior Chinese Crap"
2,Greaaat,"some sounds in songs arent played as clear as on the fm transmitter, but overall quality plays like a cd. cool."
1,Not the Frisbee i wanted,I wanted the biggest Wham-O frisbee they make. 200+ grams. The problem is the new Wham-o frisbees are made with a really hard plastic that is very hard on your hands. The image on the site was the older soft plastic model i wanted to buy.i instead got the newer hard plastic model i did not want. Will shop this item on EBay and get what i pay for.
1,Disappointed,"Well I am a true Vikki Carr fan. Love her voice and I think she is a truly wonderful human being. BUT, this CD is a big disappointment. Somehow it just doesn't work for her. I think it is a combination of the arrangements and orchastra, they just don't match her voice. Any of her Spanish or earlier music is outstanding and I recommend it, but sorry not this CD. However, the price is right so if you are confused, pick up a copy and judge for yourself. Its not awful but not typical Vikki quality."
1,WRONG ITEM AND NO ANSWER WHEN I CALL THE SELLER!!!!,"ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR WORK AND GOT THE PACKAGE TODAY....... THEY SENT ME A METAL I-PHONE CASE INSTEAD OF THE ITEM I ACTUALLY ORDERED AND PAID FOR, WHICH IS THE SAFARILAND (BASKETWEAVE) GLOVE POUCH. SO I GUESS I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK NOW AND WAIT AGAIN FOR THIS COMPANY TO GET THE CORRECT ITEM SENT TO ME. VERY FRUSTRATED THAT I PURCHASED AN ITEM WAITED FOR IT AND IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG AND WHEN I ATTEMPT TO CONTACT SELLER THERE IS NO ANSWER. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book offers a clever title . . . and little else.This book contains very little practical advice about multi-dog households. The majority of the book is general dog info (i.e. first aid, medical care, feeding). Beyond that, the author spends far too much time gushing over her own pack of German Shepherds. For me, this was irrelevant and not applicable at all to my own situation."
2,Prefer it to the replacement bought last year,"We purchased the special unit (with the metal frame) and found it to be too narrow. This one, at considerably less cost, fills the space and seems to be doing a much better job."
1,Impossible to Clean,"This waffle iron is flippin impossible to clean. No overflow area around the outside means that it literally spills all over the outside of the machine (including the power cord) when using. For a good guide to buying a decent waffle iron, check out Alton Brown's Good Eats episode titled ""the Waffle Truth""."
1,Broke on 12 th hole,I was making mortises in red oak and the bit broke on the 12th hole. I am not happy with the quality of the bit. Everything else I have that is Delta has has shown itself to be of good quality.
2,It's all in fun,"I started watching this show in the middle of Season 2.I have started a collection, posters, O postive True Blood beverage and Seasons 1 and 2.True Blood has all things packed in one hour. SEX, VIOLENCE, GOOD MUSIC, DRAMA,COMEDY,EMPATHY and a few WHAT THE HELLS. The cast, crew and writers are excellant.My neighbors and I are actually planning a Season 3 True Blood bash when the first eposide shows. In my opinion this is great entertainment. It's there for those who chose to watch."
1,Bad show.............!!!!!!!!,"One of the worst WWII movies I've seen. The uniforms were good, it looked as though tha uS troops had M-1's, the acting was class ""B"". Not recommended at all.Bruce"
1,I bought the book for it's cover,I have to be honest when I say it was the cover of the book that sold me. Despite not having too many scantily clad babes in chainmail bikinis I still liked the stories. It was refreshing to be able to read a fantasy where the women are always in peril. The short stories are a quick read and something you do not have to but a lot of effort into following. A book that as easy to but down as it is to pick up.
2,Very good cd....,"Can't believe this CD doesn't have any reviews yet. If you like hardbop jazz, then this cd is one you need to add to your collection. The cd really has a nice flow to it. Three for Amanda, and Grace are two of my favorites. Look forward toward other releases."
2,LOVE THE COVER,"PEOPLE IF YOU HAVN'T SEEN THE COVER PHOTO OF THIS SINGLE YOU GOTS TO CHECK IT OUT IT'S BEATIFUL.AS FOR THE SONG, LOVES IT.FABULOUS VOCALS.IMPRESSIVE LYRICS.I LOVE IT WHEN SHE SINGS ""DONT YOU RUN TOO FAST MY DEAR WHY DONT YOU STOP, STOP AND LISTEN TO YOUR TEARS THIER ALL YOU'V GOT"".GENIUS!BRITNEY YOU HAVE IMPRESSED ME YET AGAIN YOU ARE THE BEST THANK YOU.5 STARS FOR THIS LOVELY BALLAD.GOOD WORK."
2,WOW!!!! - fresh,"awsome, includes two different styles, ""stimulant DJ's"" and ""superfast OZ"" ....i do not OWN a mix better than this 2 hours of kicking, drum rolling HARD HOUSE....ONE of the best CD's i have ever balsted at a party.....still trying to get a hold of(volume: 1 3 and 4), damn tidy trax had to set up in the UK!!!"
2,BEST SELF-HELP BOOK I EVER READ!,"THIS BOOK IS ONE THAT YOU CAN REFER TO OVER AND OVER. SHEGIVES SO MUCH INSITE TO HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF A BETTERPERSON. SHE DOESN'T PREACH TO YOU ABOUT ANY RELIGION BEINGBETTER THAN ANY OTHER, JUST LETS YOU KNOW THAT GOD LOVES YOUNO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. THIS IS DEFINATELY A BOOK TO READ."
1,Don't Buy This Model !,"While I'm still a fan of Western Digital products, this one was discontinued for a reason. If you start trying to copy files from another drive, it eventually quits and has to be reset. I was not happy that it took a day with tech support in India before I got to a tech support guy in California who informed me that I needed the newer model. Amazon was great though to take back my product and refund my money."
2,cute,"If you liked the Tammy movies growing up, this set is a nice trip down memory lane.Nice mini marathon for a relaxing day."
1,bad switch,"bought for x-mas gift for father, who has lost circulation in feet after chemo. switch broken in less than two months"
1,college writer,"this book was ordered and I found out it was the wrong book,so we had to order the right book this time."
2,Best Bond since Goldeneye,"Agent Under Fire is the first playable Bond game since the groundbreaking Goldeneye. Although I like the N 64 controls much better, and I really wish I could make cumstom controls for AUF (there are several controller settings, but none of them are what I would like), this game still manages to beat out the laughable games of ""The World is Not Enough"" and ""Tomarrow Never Dies"".I have yet to decide if this game is better than Timesplitters. Mainly because I have not yet had the chance to play multi-player against anyone other than my 12 year old brother (he's good, but not that good). But the single player is deffinately better than Timesplitters, and although different, ranks up there with Red Factions single player."
1,Armband/belt clip useless,"Overall the radio is not bad for a small little radio, but the armband is very small, wont fit most men, and is not durable. The belt clip is a poor design in that it un clips its self from the radio when you clip it on a thicker belt. sound is good but the reception is only fair at best"
1,CheckSoft,Product not enough retail sales compatable. Does not give ability to create deductions. Just too general. Don't like check design feature.
2,One of my most prized vinyl possessions,"Sept 17, 1973. I was 18... bought the vinyl album and have loved it for many years. The last decade or so, I rarely have listened to my vinyl records. But a few days ago, I recieved a USB turntable with intentions of digitizing my vinyl collection, This album was, of course, one of the very first ones selected and after listening to it now, I can say in my opinion that it is one of the very best recordings I own. The fullness and warmth of vinyl is so far superior to mp3 or cd quality that I have decided to spend Christmas transferring more of my vinyl collection and deleting the poor quality mp3s from my player.Merry Clayton's version of ""Acid Queen"" surpasses even Tina Turner's. John Entwistle's ""Cousin Kevin"" is a masterpiece... Rod Stewart's ""Pinball Wizard"" with the LSO accompaniment is -by far- superior to any other version available."
1,How to turn a good book into a bad movie.,"The book which this movie is based on would probably have been done better as a TV miniseries. As a result of the way the move makers botched this movie, Clive Cussler (who wrote the book) will not sell any more books to Hollywood without creative control over the way the movie is made. END"
2,stunning quality for the price,"These can't be beat for under $20. They sound great. They are a little tight, but still fairly comfortable. I like their small size."
1,SLOW!!!!,"This coffee pot has a good design & I really want it to work, but it takes FOREVER. 45 - 1 hour to completely brew a pot of coffee. They seem to have forgotten the most important feature of a coffee pot. And the clock is a dumb design too.Buy something else."
2,Alternative Learning,"As a homeschooling mom, I found this book very informative and well-designed. My children (1 high school-aged taking college classes and the other elemntary school-aged) both enjoy the book and find it interesting. If you're looking for something for creative minds who have to have a reason to study a picture for a while to more fully understand concepts, this is the way to go. You can color the pictures or not and still get some useful material from this book."
1,A Train Wreck,"How could a book writen by a good writer and a interesting man, with great subjects, books, history, education, ever be so boring? If this is what memoirs have come down to they need to be outlawed. I understand that writing about oneself is difficult indeed, and very few have pulled it off, but this is brutal. This gets my worse book of the year award. 0 stars"
2,Coffee Warmer for My Desk,"I bought this warmer for my desk at work. It arrived on Saturday so I gave it a test run on the weekend. It works great, keeps my tea perfectly warm. One word of warning though, if your mug has a wide base to it, it might not fit on the plate. Other than that it just great. I'm very happy."
1,SanDisk V-Mate,Great idea but picture resembles watching old VHS tapes!!!! There is also no caption option. Hope they are working on a better version.
1,Save your money,"I like most fans of Rev. Walker look forward to his new cd's. This cd is a major disappointment. The music is not up to par with his earlier works. Many of the songs don't even sound like he had anything to do with them. If I there was any way I could get my money back, I would definitely return this cd. Do yourself a favor, listen to his earlier works and pass on this one."
2,Great Fun,"This is the final of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded Ukranian-American family.This was the best of the bunch, and there were many elements to savor: the author's usual humor and warmth, the parents (formerly leads in their own romances) relating to their adult children, and the character cameos from other series entirely.But what made this a stand out entry was the role reversal in the romance. The hero was the single parent, struggling financially and emotionally unwilling to risk. The heroine was the famous professional, financially secure and the one who made all the romantic advances. I LOVED KATE!A feel good read with a non-traditional bent."
1,don't buy it,"Besides being light on details, the copy I got had several key pages missing - there but just blank. Shows a lack of attention to detail. If you are just getting started in the tanning/leather/rawhide business it is an OK read about history and techniques but there are better books on the market. Get this one from the library."
2,Love it and use it for every run!,"First off, the price. Yellow was about half the price of the other colors. I didn't mind. The numbers are large and it has a great backlight for early in the morning when it's still dark. I even use the timer for when I proctor the ACT/SAT exams on weekends. It will store up to 100 runs. It has only five, easy to figure out buttons. The one that counts (splits, laps...) is on the face and larger than the others. The band is velcro and stays put on my skinny wrist. I can't think of a single negative except I don't think I'll be able to change the battery myself when and if the time comes. For the price, I should have bought two..."
2,very suspenseful,"I had never seen this movie before. I watched it yesterday and was very pleased. As usual, Alfred Hitchcock did not disappoint. He is usually in one scene in his movies but I did not see him in this one. Still have Vertigo to watch. Thanks for sending it so fast. Lorrie Gibson"
2,Great Video for Nice arms,"Rachel, shows you how to achieve some nice arms, and this is a good excersicefor shoulders and and overall stretch, there isn't much on abs, so there you wouldneed additional videos. Overall I would rate this 4 stars, easy to find the area on the video you would like to repeat again and again.She can move!"
2,just an awesome DVD,"first off, I gotta say that a disc dvd set, was a great idea. I have no clue how they fit so much on just 2 discs. There are more features then you can shake a stick at.The feature itself is great. If you like Star Trek, then this is a must. I really like the foil D-card and collectible booklet. It gave alot of insight into the show."
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would","Yuk, Yuk and Yuk. Lindsey loves to bring old characters from previous novels into more recent novels. I think this is an excuse she uses not to have to develop new characters. This book took the cake on revisting previous characters. In fact the book was more re-introducing you to them then it was a new story.Her conversations were too frequent and boring. I did not like the Brittany or Dalen. They had no chemistry as far as I am concerned. I could not even finish this one, what a waste of cash."
2,Inflatable Doodles/Noodles,Great for taking on a trip. I used mine in the ocean and also for snorkeling.
2,Dean Martin Italian Love Songs,Very good CD. Arrived in good condition and brought back a lot of memories of Dino. Arrived quickly.
1,Neither witty nor funny....just silly.,"I loved 'Angela's Ashes' and I wanted to like this book. The four and a half star reviews and the wonderful book cover gave me the impression that this book is witty and charming. Unfortunately, it is neither. I just found it downright silly. Could not get past Chapter 3."
1,Not recommended for MCSE exam,"This book will not help you pass the exam. You may learn good networking stuff, but I'm sure when you buy this book, you are preparing for the exam. MCSE exam covers a lot more than what the book offers."
2,Mental Gymnastics,"It takes some time to get fully into this book, but it is truly worth it! This is a book that requires some serious reader participation; you must really try to imagine things as much as you did with books when you were little. I'm on the third book in the series, and they're so seamlessly written that they could all be combined into one enormous book. Stay with it, and read them all. I can't wait for the next one!"
1,Not worth it,"Who has time (other than stay at home women) to examine charts on a daily basis? While this book provides some useful information, all it really shows a woman is how to tell when she is ovulating. There is a much easier solution - buy an ovulation predictor kit! The kits are easier to use and do not require a woman to write everything down on a chart. Also, this book has NO information about things that could impair fertility (such as environmental factors, smoking, foods, etc.). I would recommend Marilyn Glenville's ""Boost Your Fertility"" instead of this book."
1,Disappointing fifth title....,"I WAS so enthralled with Cliff Janeway's character, his love of books and all that good, good knowledge...that this fifth endeavor of Mr. Dunning's just left me dazed with disappointment.It doesn't matter that I never knew anything about horses and the racetrack (I found that a very interesting aspect) but this entire novel left a lot to be desired on so many levels. I, too, was glad not to have spent any money on this having borrowed it from the library.I can only hope that the next Janeway novel is a vast improvement on all levels over this one. PLEASE! Susan"
2,Great book - not the best packing for an item so large,"The book is amazing. It is a definite must have in any photography book collection. Even though this is the ""light"" version of the book, it is still quite impressive. Still, the packaging for international shipping (I'm located in Mexico) was not the best for a product this size. The book arrived slightly bent in one corner. Not a show stopper, but it was annoying to have such a magnificent piece slightly damaged. This is the second time that large scale items sent from Amazon have arrived with minor bumps. I have never had problems with regular sized books. I would no doubt order this book again from Amazon since the savings are better than the damage suffered, but be warned.As for the quality of the pictures, it is simply and without a doubt worth the price. Could the print be better - yes it could; for the price paid, it is a good balance."
1,Dangerous for children!,"My nieces grandmother bought this waterslide for their birthdays. The set up is quite easy and the kids do have fun however, mixing an inflatable and water is not a good idea. We had some neighbor girls over to play with my nieces and one of the girls flew down the slide so quickly she landed on the grass onto her back and knocked the wind out of herself! She was okay to breathe after a few minutes but also has a large bruise on her back. If this is happening to kids while being supervised, I can only imagine what is happening to kids who are not being watched! I expect this item will be recalled in a few weeks!"
2,Nice Sound,Nice sound - would have been great if my mobile was capable of syncing to it. Oops did not check a mobile upgrade will solve that ; )
2,Exploring Chemical Analysis,"The textbook was exactly what I wanted, the edition I wanted, and I received it promptly. I have nothing to complain about."
1,Very different from English manufactured dinnerware,I did not realize how different the Bangladesh manufactured dinnerware is from the English manufactured product. It does not match my previously owned dinnerware.
2,I was the perfect person to test this ...,"I was the perfect person to test this product. I have had many UTIs (urinary tract infections) in the past, especially while pregnant. I'm three months pregnant now, and will continue to use these. Pregnancy often masks the symptoms of UTIs and when they go unchecked they can lead to kidney infection and even early labor. These strips were very easy to use, and they worked quickly. I'll probably test myself once a week throughout my pregnancy."
2,What's to say!!??,"This album DEFINATELY rocks. Art Alexakis is a genius, and Greg Eklund's beats may get a bit repetitive, but you just can't get enough! If you like Eve6 or Third Eye Blind this album's for you. But if you're more hard rock than that, you absolutely MUST add their album ""World Of Noise"" to your collection. It's dark and special in it's own Genius Hand-ed way. Track 8 Sparkle is an AWESOME song. World Of Noise is by far my favorite album EVER!! And Sparkle and Fade is up there with it!!"
2,One of Disney's best,"While made in the 80s, this is one of the best movies that Disney was able to produce in that era that was satisfying to kids as well as adults. While I wasn't that old when the movie came out, but when I was able to watch it, it was one of the movies I could watch quite a bit while I was young. As I got older I never knew if this movie was on DVD and when I was able to pick it up I did. Upon watching this movie, it was just like when I remembered it and I feel that this movie definitely aged well, at least to me it did. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has kids or just wanting to watch a movie from when they were growing up when I was. Although that there's no special features with this movie but that don't hinder this movie whatsoever. Overall I give this movie a 4 stars out of 5."
1,stupid actually,I can not say what was more stupid about this movie. It's amazing how shallow everyone was in this picture. They all claim to love each other but really they would not know love from a night out with a call girl.
1,Great for mosquitos,"1 star for its effectiveness in wiping up the ""blood"" of insects that come way too close to my cat, and it's a good mosquito slammer, as well.The author trades on the ""blood of Christ"" metaphor to line his wallet and fleece others.Bad bad blood!"
1,What's The Worst That Could Happen?,"I have never ordered anything from this supplier before and I never will. I never received my merchandise, nor did I ever receve a response back from this merchant when I sent them an email regarding the delay."
2,Does it or doesn't it?,"I purchased Insulow after reading about it in Dr. Richard Berstein's book ""Diabetes Solution"". The product is a bit pricey but it does seem to work for me. I do not have seriously high blood sugars so the response is not huge but I do find my sugar is lower when I take the capsules as directed. When I forget to take them, I see the difference. As with all medications and particularly those for diabetes, we repond differently according to how our bodies work. I will most likely continue to use this product with my doctor's approval. Please be sure to discuss any medication with your health care provider."
1,"Amazing guitar, but shoddy attempt at a story","It pains me to have to give any Buckethead album such a low score as this, but I feel that I simply have to. While this CD does contain some amazing guitar playing and a few very strong pieces, but I think that the attempt to make the whole follow a story-line was, put mildly, rather unsuccessful--a lot of the intermission pieces seem to have no point at all. That isn't to say that this album is all-bad--quite the contrary. The opening theme is amazing, the long track ""Computer Master"" shows Buckhead's versatility, and the ""Home Run Derby"" main theme is easily Buckethead's best.It has its great moments, but only moments."
1,wrong item than what I thought it was going to be,The shipping was quick and well packaged. But it was not what I thought it was going to be. I will probably give to to someone who can use it.
1,"Excellent idea, but smells","On the upside, delivery was fast and the pillowcase seems like its pretty good quality. I appreciated the instructions that accompanied the pillow. Overall, I had high expectations for this pillow, but it smells. I've tried leaving it to air out with the zipper open as well as out in the sun for about two weeks. I finally tried sleeping with it and I've had headaches everyday since. I finally gave up last night when I woke up with a headache ... I'll try airing it out in a separate part of the house, hopefully the odor goes away and I'll try again in a couple of months, but its a little frustrating. I wish the hulls were aired out for quite awhile before they were added to the pillow."
2,Fascinating Book,"I enjoyed this book. Normally, I avoid topics such as math, biology, and ecology in my pleasure reading, and I don't think I would have picked this one up if it weren't on my book club's list. But I was drawn into this book immediately. The writing is great -- smart, surprising, funny at times-- and I was completely absorbed by the complex, interesting characters, the settings, and of course, the fascinating story. Do read Brazaville Beach. You'll learn something and be entertained at the same time."
2,Lorax,"Kids loved it, and the adults as well, we all were capitvated with the movie will watch it again enjoy"
2,If you buy a Grateful Dead studio album,"This is the one to get.And if you want another, then get Workingmans' Dead.But after that - I would recommend exploring the wide open universe of easily live recordings - the professionally released albums like ""Without a Net"" and the ""Dicks Picks"" and ""From the Vault"" series. If you STILL want more - it's out there for you to find ... around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you! ;-P*"
2,"Truly masterful, just like most of Cameron's other works","James Cameron directed and wrote this very beautifully shot, masterfully told underwater saga. Like his other masterful works, The Abyss deserves credit for the technological achievements; therefore, it propelled all films since into a new realm of computer graphics.The acting of Ed Harris is Oscar quality, though he was not given credit.Cameron's other version, the 'Special Edition' is quite impressive...as far as the original story is concerned, it makes incredibly more sense. But with either cut, this movie deserves our most abundent attention for the message against our many dangerous defenses that is obviously relayed by director, Cameron.Two thumbs high up in the air and it gets my utmost respect for the attempt of trying our senses against violence, not obvious to even the director--I see it clear as day in most of Cameron's films."
1,Good book if you have an uneven leg on your coffee table!,"I had to read this book for a class at American Military University. I do not have time to write in detail like Gaetan Lion did but I completely agree with him. This book is so obvious that I'm surprised that anyone gets anything out of it. Insightful? Not in the least bit. No offence to the writer, she seems like a nice person, but other than assigning her titles to things I already knew I got nothing from the book. I recommended to the college that they remove this book from their curriculum. If you are attending APUS and must read it all I can say is at least it's a quick easy read and if you agree with my review to please let the college know in the end of course survey."
2,Different..Honest..Interesting!,"This book on Evita is quite different on the part that it was written by someone who went to that country to study how Eva Peron affected the society around her decades later.She is well rounded in her studies of Evita and the different takes on the different myths that surround this girl from the pampas is very interesting.Don't ask me why I gave it Four stars! I'm a man and I love Eva.But,it seems suitable...Okay? Respects to Julie Taylor..of course!"
2,Rival RF22 filter review,"The package is a little tattered but otherwise the filters work fine. Need to trace old filter onto new one, and cut. Works for most deep fryers."
2,Need to learn german language.,"I think that this is the most important work into XX century philosophy. But if you really want to understand ""Sein und Zeit"" is very important that you read the book in Heidegger's maternal language: german."
1,Needs Improvement,If you are new to SQL server and want to know the basics of the application then this books if your you. If you want to pass the exam however then I suggest you look else where. The material is too simplistic and there are too much typo errors. I read the book twice before turning to other materials like the Transcenders and Self Test software and I must say had it not been for the other materials that I used I would have failed the exam.
1,avoid at all costs,"Item needed repair right out of the box, had to be taken to repair center. What they call an on/off switch was defective. Actually, there is no on/off switch, you have to tilt the handle to turn it on -- very inconvenient. This seems to be a cheaply made poorly designed machine. Haven't tried it yet, really don't care how well it works, since the way it is built it won't last very long."
1,I tried so hard to read this that my teeth hurt!,"This is only the second book in my life that I could not get through. The language is difficult, the characters totally unsympathetic, the plot tedious to non-existent. After struggling mightily for several weeks (I usually read 2/week) I just had to give up. OUch."
1,Dead Zeppelin: Painfully funny,"I bought this c.d. for my boyfriend who hates Led Zeppelin(which I love)but loves death metal in an attempt to fuse our musical styles together into something we could both appreciate. Although this album is not really a great quality one, it is funny as hell! Some of the songs just cracked me up! Especially the rendition of ""Immigrant Song."" Unlike most tribute albums, this one is kind of cool in the way that the artists covering the songs totally re-worked them, instead of just repetitively playing back the songs in their original form. Whether you are a hard-core death metal enthusiast, or a Zeppelin fan with a sense of humor, you are sure to enjoy this album.My boyfriend did!"
2,Explains what you need to know,"Can you copy that pretty picture or graphic that you saw online to use for your personal website or brochure?That's the question that I face every day because I do quite a bit of professional work with graphics.I don't have time or money to have a professional copyright lawyer on my staff to help me decypher when I'm using a graphic legally. This has led to me always buying exclusive licenses or nonexclusive licenses for virtually every graphic that I use but this adds a ton of costs to any production project.This work opens up the public domain to me so that I have a thorough understanding of what's legal to use from public domain information and what is not. I love this work, it's written clearly and plainly and with it really helps me understand this important realm (public domain).It really helps me respect the rights of others while at the same time allowing me to open up the world to low cost content options."
2,Excellent book,I had seen the movie and so I wanted to read the book. It is an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to others.
1,dull and boring with random characters,"This is one of the poorest reads I've sledged through in a while. Random loosely related characters, with little depth, and a silly imaginative plot line that has many logical inconsistencies. The concept could have been handled with a one chapter short story, but instead drags endlessly on. Well almost endlessly -- thank you for finally dying, Ms. Byrd, and putting us all out of our misery."
2,Sweet Spot,"As someone who has been addicted to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright since my teenage years, this book showed me more of his magnificence. Forever a fan and devotee!"
1,"Promising title, disappointing DVD.","First, the technicalities. The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows.Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie."
1,One lousy book...,"Besides being disjointed and poorly written, it had a big build-up conspiracy that floundered and died. We also found perversions that had nothing what-so-ever to do with the story. And the story - What story?Kay and Lucy did *a little* investigating, and we already knew who the killer was! A complete waste.Worst book I've ever read. I'll never read another Cornwell novel."
2,A new frontiere from the past,"I think many people will not love this album. But I think they will be wrong. I mean from the beginning of the cd to the last note you are in touch with the soul of bjork. The emotions that it gave to me were so beautiful and I can't tell you how much I felt happy. It's not really only vocal cd, there are many electronic effects and percussions and choirs. If you love "" An echo a stain "" You will Love this record. It is the natural step after Vespertine, is hard but so deep, so human, so different each time you listen it. I'm so curious to see how she will make the next tour. Buy it and sorry for my poor english !!!!!!"
1,not worth the time,"i've read all the pendragon books. but when i think about them i can only remember the story up to the middle of the Aurther book, the rest is just a blur. WHEN I TRIED to read this book i found myself getting side-tracked,(for long periods of time i would just sit there and stare at the pages, or the wall), this book is really boring. After 2 years i'm on page 45 or 50 or something. And i can't stand the christian theme. i don't beleive in god so i can't relate to this book."
2,It's All That,"Mainly just want to give this 5 stars. Before I bought the CD back in the 90s, I already knew I liked The Cure, but this CD elevated them in my mind. I became protective of the CD and didn't really play it around other people or any of that because, you know what happens when people want to ""borrow"" a CD. Anyway, I eventually let a relative borrow it once and, of course, it's gone. That thing was still completely playable after all that time... Well, here I am now looking to get a replacement. But yeah, the CD is more than just a mix, it's like a reworking and to be perfectly clear, the songs are just plain better on this CD than the prior versions (IMNSHO). Worth every penny and then some."
2,yarr,"Love the movies. Happy to have in Blu Ray. I agree with review that little disappointed, no benefits over the DVD, aside from 1080p and sound. Better price on Amazon, than I paid on impulse buy (should have used the price app). Ah well. Guess I'll watch these sooner, than later."
2,diabetes testing supplies,This product arrived in a timely manner and met all of our expectations. We are very satisfied.
2,The best book of a great series.,"A read, read and read some more book. If you like military history these are absolutly incredable journals to the way it was. The emotion and fears of the time are reborn in it's pages. A must read for every American."
2,Great read!,This was a suspenseful book that had me intrigued until the very end. It was a very thorough crime novel and I enjoyed it
1,Good Name But,"New Hope isn't really the most haunted town in the US. Frankly I've seen houses with more activity then every historical site in New Hope combined. Don't get me wrong I love New Hope. I grew up their (I still live near by), and I began my lifes work as a ghost hunter in New Hope. The Logan Inn was the first haunted site I ever researched (for a school newspaper article), I've done the ghost tours bit, and been in a lot of the sites on this show. The show though is badly done. Its format is very flat and uninteresting. Like far to many amateurs they obsess over orbs (which are hands down the least interesting and most easily explained of all ""psychic"" photography) and some of there other pictures are questionable as well. I would suggest the books of the late Mary Adi Kent instead of this documentary."
2,Basic Rules,"The Quick Reference Racing Rules is a summary of the racing rules, put on an extremely heavy duty laminated card. The picture shown by Amazon.com is half of what your are buying, which are the basic rules that most expereince sailors know. The flip side lists some racing definitions, when to hail, how to file a protest, when and how to do penalty turns, etc. This summary is probably most useful for the novice sailor; or the more experienced sailor who doesn't race often and wants a quick refresher. One advantage is the heavy duty construction means you can take it on your boat without fear of it getting wet. It also lists the rule numbers that all race committee members seem to have memorized. This is the only quick reference that I've every seen published. Note that this 4th edition is for the 1997-2000 rules, which have changed slightly."
2,A Must read! Great Bonding for my husband and I !,"My husband and I really enjoyed taking the quiz and learning about our dosha. It was a nice bonding experience for us! With our lives so crazy these days, we never take the time to really talk and learn about each other! You too will enjoy reading, quizzing and learning about each other!"
1,Won't work in my Honda Del Sol or CRV,This siphon will not get past the too small opening in either of my Honda's so I'm going to need to return it. It would help if the manufacturer provided a web link to which vehicles it will and won't work with.
1,metal allergy,I love the Omiron and had a plastic clip which broke after several yeaars of use. I happen to have an allergy to nickle and Have broken out with this metal one. To say the least I am unhappy that there was a change from plastic to metal.
2,Soap Opera with lovely accoutrements,"Yes, it is a soap opera with lovely costumes & locale. Very good acting & correct historical perspective. The story line of the upper crusts & the servants is a wonderful political statement. Enjoy!"
1,printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!,"printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!and have fun trying to buy the photoconductor locally, because it's not sold anywhere in the greater Phoenix AZ area. basically, this printer has become the elephant in the room in my office. it's just taking up space and collecting dust!"
2,Another quality FAX USA release,"As far as Im concerned, you cant go wrong with these double disc FAX USA releases. Another solid delivery of mind and mood altering music. Get it if you can."
2,GET THE EXTENSION KIT!!!,I purchased this with my Play Yard and connects easily. I love this product.
1,"Looked good, but...","This bike rack seemed like a great way to hang two bikes, but the top rack (on the upper bar) does not secure tight enough to hold a bike secure, it slides down. An expensive mistake."
1,It is not for Olympus C3030,"I do not understand why this bag is on the C3030's list of accessories. It's to small for C3030. I bought it, hardly could squash the camera, than forgot to send it back. Just a warning for others ....."
2,thoughtful and entertaining,"Although some people who reviewed this book felt it was sub-standard for Haldeman it fit my criteria of a good book. First, it was a good read. Second the plot had substance. Third, it made me think about the central issues within the novel. I'm happy when two of the three standards are met. As for the politically correct business I don't think so. Haldeman has never been that kind of writer, he has often brought about the ambiguity in relationships and of possible futures. Characters don't have to be likeable to be interesting or engaging. The issues of the cost of peace may be handled better in other books but Haldeman's take seems honest which makes this a book I'd suggest to others."
2,its what i wanted but after 1 month,"its a exactly what i wanted and expected for my 2009 chevrolet cobalt SS and it looks great....but after a month the adhesives on one side come off and now i have to contact someone or go buy another one. i had them on my cavalier sport, and S-10 Zr2 for headlights taillights and 3rd brake light, so usually i never have a problem."
2,One of my favorite Crusie titles!,"I have read many of Crusie's books and this one is my favorite. I love the idea of revisiting a high school romance as Maddie and CL do....very sexy! The murder mystery makes things exciting and helps draw CL and Maddie closer. I saw the best friend's secret a mile away, but figuring things like that out is half the fun in Crusie's books. This is a great one. Take this book and Crusie's Welcome to Temptation on your next vacation for fun reading."
2,Master Sudoku,"This book is excellent. It completely explains the methods for solving sukoku puzzles. There are practice puzzles that range from simple to most difficult. Within a few hours of studying the book, I was fairly efficient at solving even the most difficult ones. I absolutely recommend this book."
2,Interesting and gripping,Grisham always gets the reader into the key character of the book and this is no exception. Description of Bologna is spot on and the journey that the character takes is a very lonely but exciting. Taut thriller!
2,Don't Miss Out on this Book,"It's hard to find books on class in America that aren't incredibly dense and boring reads. This is not one of those books. Ehrenreich is a good writer who lends her investigative journalism background to a difficult and controversial topic. While some readers may debate her method in ""living"" in poverty, this is a good first step into trying to understand the underclass or working poor in America. Whether you end up agreeing or disagreeing with Ehrenreich, this is an interesting book that will spark you think about an issue that has the possibility of becoming the next big issue in America."
2,Perfect Curls!,I have used these Conair Swizzlers for many years and I will not go back to any other kind of rollers. I have very long hair and I like to wear my hair up in a french bun or just straight down. I use these rollers on the top and bangs and curl them tightly. Then I fluff my hair using my fingers instead of a comb or brush to separate each strand of hair. I get more fluff using my fingers. Then I gather the ends and pin to the top and back or I leave my hair straight down. My hair looks so fluffy and full of curls. It is amazing how these little curlers work! It's fun to experiment different styles of hair-do's. I use it also on my little grandchildren. It doesn't burn their scalp and they are light weight. My children even use the rollers as a toy. They make circles and chains. It's fun and they are great! You have to try them at least once. I guarantee you will be satisfied.
1,Not at all accurate!,"Buy this book for the illustrations if you want, but don't be lured into believing that the scholarship is accurate! Cosman does NOT document her recipes (as a matter of fact, she has admitted in lectures to making some of them up), she does not give original recipes and sources, and she continually substitutes ingredients and methods unknown in Europe in the Renaissance. This book is old and the ""fantasy"" research is long outdated by the excellent work of Hieatt, Santich, Redon, Scully, and the like."
2,A Beautiful Story in the Voice of A Wise Child,"This both nostalgic and timeless story of a young girl on the threshold of adolescence ""hooked"" me by page 11 when she tries to make sense out of adult behavior, particularly her mother's attitude about ""right"" and ""wrong"". Remembering this time of watching grownups for guidance but still wanting to figure things out on one's own, I found her insights and reactions very ""on the mark"". What I will remember most about this excellent little book, is the attempt to make sense of all the types of ""Religions"" and beliefs she encounters. The peak, the highlight for me came on pages 187-188 with a serendipitous, mystical moment that gave me chills. I liked the ""afterwords"" and her conclusions about the Meaning of Life"""
2,Rockabilly Retards and Rockabilly Slobs,i absolutely love this movie bought this copy and wish they would put it on dvd. if your a fan of robert rodriguez or just a slob like me you'll love this flick.xoomxoom
2,Pharaun you are a pimp,"This one was even better than Dissolution. With the incredible intrigue of Ched Nasad unfolding slowly in a dark trap that could be the end of the Menzoberranzyr it is a great book. Only problem- The beginning can be a little dull but, like all books involving the drow, the intrigue and chaos will pull anyone in. I couldn't put it down!"
2,Read this if you value sleep and a happy baby!,"between my 2 sisters and myself, we've used this on 5 out of 6 of our babies. The first of the six, my daughter - aged 9, still has trouble getting to sleep without a head rub or many trips down stairs. All the others love their beds, they love going to bed and they sleep well throughout the night. All 5 slept through the night by 8 weeks while my first didn't sleep though the night until 14 months!"
2,Suprised,"When I got this glove in the mail I looked at it and said ""This thing is supposed to make my hand feel better?"" It is small and simple in design. I have fairly long hands and the glove is a little tight to get on but fits very snugly. I use it on my left hand, and I was very surprised to find that it actually makes my hand feel a lot better. I use it all the time while at work on the keyboard, or at home while I play video games.I probably wouldn't recommend this for people with very large or significantly wide hands."
1,Don't last very long at all.......,"I bought this to go with my cordless 20v Dewalt set of tools. This might not be so much the fault of the blade, as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set. Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard, you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade, and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw. If you have the same set of tools, or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade, then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with, and the rest of the blade is still perfect, but utterly useless.I have used other brands, with far better results, these are throw away blades, in my opinion."
2,"Swift,Speedy and Unbeatable!!","According to the comic,the Stealth Hunter is the air arm and the top esponiage unit for Exo-Force.It`s rival is the Fire Vulture,which is more armored.Now, here`s the cool part.It`s about the pilot, Hikaru, like other pilots, his head has dual faces to change expressions.The Stealth Hunter is always backed up by Takeshi`s Grand Titan,or else it`ll just end up half destroyed,forcing Ryo and his Uplink to repair it.I love it, but I still don`t have it.The Stealth Hunter is the best !!!!!!!!"
1,taste so different from the Laksa taste,"Taste kind of sour, somehow i think it is too old, so the taste has changed a bit. I won't recommend people buying from this site"
2,ALL IN - POCKET ACES: Hold'em chip set is a WINNER!,"Best bang for your buck - for less than $40 free ship @ 500 good quality clay chips + nice case: it's ALL IN or fold em' Chips look pretty good, nice weighted feel. Comes complete set as described and pictured.FYI: This is not a $150 ""quality chip set"" more like $75 value and you're definitely getting your money's worth at half the price on amazon.Fast shipping within a few days of arrival, no dents, no scratches to case.I bought a different poker chip set at a discount store 2 years ago for about $45 and it was horrible, fake light weight chips made of plastic and was incomplete.Buy this set - YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO PLAY ALL IN NO LIMIT WITH THIS SET!"
2,Torchwood season two,"Torchwood is awesome, however it would have been really nice if Amazon could have posted me a version that i could actually watch on Australian dvd players, considering it was being shipped to Australia and all..."
1,Poor quality,Contacted this order sender and stated that quality of product was poor and nothing would come of it - two others that had bad products immediately credit my account. To return this order would cost more than was feasible.
2,di di di dora,"this is what i had when i was little, now i passed it on to my little sister and she loves her di di di dora"
2,Great read,This book stands out because the author has a great deal of first-hand BM experience and also was able to track down and secure interviews with a very broad range of participants from all levels of the BM hierarchy. The writing style is both erudite and highly entertaining.
1,I lost another 85 minutes of my life,"What's the point of this film? A girl trying to find out the meaning of love and pretending it's a documentary. So what. I think Charlyne Yi is the only thing decent about Paper Heart. She is funny in an adorable kind of way, but even her ""performance"" wears thin over 85 minutes. The movie description didn't really interest me, so I knew I was taking a chance going in. I was hoping for a nice surprise and I ended up just waiting for it to be over. It's not all bad, but the good moments are few and very far between. Oh, Michael Cera in real life acts the same as M.C. in every movie he does. What a range."
1,Fraud,"To any true Sinatra fan, this collection represents some of his weaker stuff. The claim that it is ""Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits"" is totally fraudulent."
2,Very thorough food guide,"I never thought I'd find such an extensive library on zone food blocks, including ready-made TV dinners and fast food. It does not include everything, but it makes a very good attempt at doing so."
2,Very good artist,"I along with many of you have discovered this artist thru The Weather Channel and their great music backgrounds.My personal favorite is ""Sunshine in the Rain"" I love all the little nuances of simple notes and background melodys.However, saying that, I will say that the only downside (if there is one) is that most all of Ryan's music seems to sound the same, the variety of style is not present as it is in artist such as Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, Synergy, or even, ah hem... Robert Wolf.Yes, I too have been guilty of favoring a certain keyboard or sound on that keyboard and put it into other songs, so I can't really blame Ryan for doing that, It all sounds good, we just have to be careful about monotony.Even so, I think this is an artist well worth listening to and I expect room to grow and more good things to come from such a young musician. I highly recommend it."
1,Terrible,"I am extremely dissatisfaction with this product, the TuneJuice (2009 design) Backup battery pack for iPhone. Griffins advertisement that people will get more out of their iPhone or iPod is completely false. I have attempted to use this product on several occasions with fresh AAA batteries to extend the life of my iPhone, but have been unsuccessful. Yes, the TuneJuice will recharge the battery in my iPhone 3GS using 4 AAA batteries, however, I'm lucky if I a get a 50% charge out of fresh batteries before this product shuts-off and/or stops working. Griffins claim that people will get ""hours more music, video, talk time, web access"" is false. I bought this product with the hopes of keeping my iPhone alive while I'm on the go and away from power sources, but my hopes have been met with disappointment and dissatisfaction."
1,Country Classics,"I saw this product being advertized on PBS. With the video clips, it appeared much better than just sitting listening to it. O.K, it's the kind of music my parents listened too a LOT when I was a kid and I just wanted a little trip down memory lane. If you're into older country (which has it's advantages), this is for you. Some of the songs are surprisingly humorous and ALL of them tell a story worth thinking about. I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I can't complaint too much. Volume TWO, in my opinion, is better... If not for Glen Campbell, however, I'd probably put it away for a rainey day... Glen was absolutely great. So, incidentally, was Merle Haggard. I surprised myself liking his voice so much..."
2,Works great!,"I recently replaced my old desktop with a laptop but I still wanted to be able to work at my desk. My mouse, keyboard and external hard drive would have used up all of my available USB ports on my new laptop, so I chose to use this USB hub to connect all my USB equipment to and only use 1 USB port on my laptop. It has worked great. Small in size, yet heavy enough so that it doesn't move around on its own. I am very happy with it. I would recommend it."
1,A major disappointment from a fantastic group.,"This CD is profoundly disappointing. Gone are the wonderful, wacky, chill-out tunes like ""Donkeys in Heaven,"" or that song where the cat meows through it. Fully half the tracks here sound like Oasis outtakes, with a lead singer who'd be booed off a karaoke stage. Banal lyrics are repeated over and over again until you run screaming for the ""off"" button. Maybe three tracks are reminiscent of the Bent we know and love, but they're not worth wandering through the dross.I don't know what happened -- if, like with Wham!, the talented part of the group left -- but this is a major disappointment from a wonderful group."
2,Fishies!,"I bought these for my sister. She's accessorizing her (and her hubby's) lake house with lotsa fish decorations. These are great (they actually look like fish, mounted bass in particular!). If you or yours are into fishing, this is a great stocking stuffer."
2,GREAT PET GATE!,"This pet gate is great! Works exactly as prescribed. Had it installed in about 10min. I left my dog alone for a few hours today and he didn't even try to knock the gate down (because he can't). It's very sturdy. As long as you follow the instructions and make sure the spindle rods are tight against the wall, it won't budge. It's pressure mounted so keep that in mind. Highly recommend!"
1,please,"If pretension, tedium, and self-indulgence are your thing, then this is the album and Melancon is the 'artist' for you. This is, put simply, one of the worst albums I have ever heard. If you want to hear popular emo music listen to Dashboard Confessional, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, or even Saves The Day. This premeditated depression sound is plain irritating. The songwriter seems to be trying to turn his mediocre mid-life crisis into catchy teen angst. Mostly, it just sounds like an old man in a coffee shop strumming his guitar and whining. Is this supposed to be clever?"

2,Incredible! Both fun and moving.,"Amazing! One of the best jazz albums I have ever heard. Duckwalk mixes fun, funky, upbeat songs like Duckwalk, American Green, Go, and Elvis, with beautiful slower tracks like Down South and Innocents. Great music, especially Steve Dobrogosz' piano work and Magnus' drumming. If you like jazz, you'll love it."
1,What's with this scarf?,"Love EL's books but this tried my patience. Donovan series was better. I think she threw the Donovans in to keep us going. Knew who the 'bad guy' was from the very beginning. No surprises there. All the characters seemed a bit shallow. The final, final chapter about her own life was more interesting than the book. The scarf bit was eerie but then she made sense of it finally. If you are a fan, it's worth a night's time to read this."
2,Nice!!!,This bowl is nice. It is a bright blue and made of thick glass. You can tell it is not the cheap stuff you find at TJ Maxx etc.
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"I am one of the few who think that Scott Peterson didn't get a fair trial and I bought this book. After reading it, it actually made me see his guilt because of the other posibilites Mr.Dalton describes are rediculous! Evan the writing of this book was awful. Not worth the 3 hours it took to read!!!"
1,Too heavy at beginning to be useful,"After a useful chapter 1 ""Quickstart"", the text plunges quickly into mind-boggling complexity, including lengthy initial ""Security basics"", philosophic ""Overview of JEE application development"", ""Web application principles"", ""Web application design"", and a do-it-my-way ""Setting up a development environment"" chapters. Do we have to have Ant and MySQL installation at the start? Finally, chapters 9 and 10 are helpful for those who either persevered or skipped ahead.Publishers should require better writing skills from their authors and ""cut-the-crap""."
1,Horrible,"We tried this monitor for the first time during nap time in his crib as he currently still sleeps in a bassinet in our room. The monitor did NOT pick up any noise, not even his stuffed toy that sings. The static just being in the next room was so loud we had to turn down the volume, but then didn't hear him when he was crying. My husband went in the room, talked and messed with the monitor and it didn't pick up anything. This will be returned. (yes we tried batteries, plugging it in, checking channels and different positions)"

1,probably nothing but garbage,"this is what the idiots in hollywood churn out nowadays. Mindless fodder for mindless numbskulls....vampires are nice people, and you want to be in love with them.........NOT!!!! If memory serves, vampires are ""MONSTERS"", and want nothing but to kill you and drink your damn blood!!! That's why I laugh at this moronic, mindless crap turned out by hollywood........MAKES ME SICK!!!"
1,This is it?,"I would think that a book about transaction-cost-reducing trading strategies would discuss market microstructure and quantitative methods. Nope. I am reminded of Paul Wilmott comparing math to mountain-climbing gear: too little, and you won't make it to the first camp; too much, and you will collapse under the weight midway. This one, not having nearly enough equipment, walks around the mountain. Don't look up."
2,Best knife ever!,"I now have two of these, just in case something happens to one, I have a back up while the other is getting fixed. This is the main knife that I use in my kitchen, and it is fantastic. You can't beat a MAC knife, especially this one!"
1,SWEET GARBAGE!!!!!!!,Kevin Trudeau is amazing.He's one of the greatest rip-offartists of our time.Watch as Kevin Trudeau skillfully misleads you and takes you for as much money as he can.There hasn't been a scammer this awesome since John Beckor Robert Allen.His bull-#$%t skills are unmatched andhis uncanny use of unsupported facts are a joy to behold.Kevin Trudeau has helped thousands to be ripped off andhe can help you to.Kevin Trudeau's book has disappointed and mis-representeditself to thousands of readers.It has deflated theexpectations of people across America and youcould be next!Experts and critics are raving about Kevin Trudeau'scontinued ability to scam and lie.Kevin Trudeau is a legend in his own time!!!!
2,Code: The hidden language of computer hardware and software,Excellent book for anyone who is interested in learning moreabout code of computers and software... a real eye opener.Would recommend this book to anyone interested in getting intothe Information Technology field.
2,Screenwriting mad easy,"Final Draft is a great piece of software which will make your screenwriting a lot easier. Very intuitive and straight forward. If you are serious about writing scripts, give into the industry standard and get Final Draft. The only comment I would have is that it looks a little retro for this day and age. They could work on the design a little. But this does not keep it from being a great program. You won't regret this purchase."
2,Works fantastic.,We needed a place to put all of our extra cooking equipment. So we settled on using two heavy wheeled wire shelfs in the garage. We wanted to keep the equipment as clean as possible so these filled the requirement. Have two of these and the buttons and grommets have stayed firmly attached. Highly recommend.
1,It must be a bad joke!,"I went to quite o lot of trouble to get the cassettes and was deeply disappointed when I got them and found out that in two items set, one cassette is completely destroyed - the tape is broken in two pieces and creased. I just can't imagine how a seller can write that condition is good, when in fact it is unacceptable!!! What am I supposed to do with such a ""good cassettes""???? I tried to contact the seller via Amazon, but never got a reply. Thanks again!"
2,I feel compelled,"I feel compelled to put in my two or three cent review before reading what others have said. I purchased the DVD set months before watching a single episode. It sat gathering dust because I was expecting a perhaps lust-ier regurgitation of all that we've seen about gay people's lives...sadness, pain, rejection, humiliation offset by a laughing caricature-like character or few who would say, ""Its all OK.""What I started out with, as I sat down to go through my children's out-grown clothing, was a view of the lives of people who were gay AND human beings with real lives and...um stuff. What I ended up with was a closet of messy children's clothing because I was compelled to watch undistracted. I immediately purchased the rest of the seasons and was a gruesome addict to the end.I've seen the Lesbiyawn series The Lword. When will they get a show as powerful and clever as QAF? I can say that because I've dated a few..."
2,"Great flick, could have added a ""teen years"" segment","I loved every part of this flick, but agree with an earlier review of the necessity of ""epic-ness"". I would think that would include a little on the ""teen years"". Kinda like you always wonder about Jesus' teen years. Show me that, too, please. All in all, great flick. Momoa was perfect as Conan in the sense people are used to: blending the Frazetta idea and R E Howard's vision of the character. Smarter than the Arnold Conan. And your average bear. Emotion, reaction......Awesome.The leading lady was good as well. They made her somewhat tough on her own, which is good. Conan wouldn't want a damsel in distress in that way.I hope they do a sequel, there is is a lot more can be done with Conan, and keep Momoa.If you like Conan at all,you'll enjoy this film."
2,First impression? Read what I have to say.,"My first impression of the CD was a good one. From what I've heard so far, it's definitely worth getting ahold of. I have only heard one song ""What You Got"" and pieces of some othersand from what I've heard it blows the debut CD away! There's more anger! It's much heavier! And of course there're plentyof bursts of rap and ear bleeding screams. Check it out now!*note: Just got the cd the other day and just wanted to add, what a great CD it is. Awesome! Darker than the first one, harder, and yes there's rapping too! Plenty of it along with screaming. Go buy it now!If you like this, I recommend: Lifer, From Zero and Nullset."
2,"Lost, the final word","The long awaited final season of LOST. The writers made a few choices at the outset that i personally would not have made, but in their usual style they made the choices and stuck to them to the end. the season is just as tense and well written as the ones that came before and the scenery and acting is also up to par. if you were a fan of the previous seasons then you'll already be planning to watch this one. it was not the expected way for the series to end, but it was a fitting one."
2,Great Surf Tunes ...,Great disc with over 20 Surf Tunes. A must for the surf music lover. Buy it you will like it.
1,You Need a Proofreader!,"Didn't anyone else have a problem with the fact this book was riddled with errors? Or is it that there aren't enough readers who recognize that books should be grammatically correct? There are words left out of sentences, gross grammatical errors, misspellings, even words that don't exist! (I dare you to find a definition for 'viverent')I'm sure there's a story there somewhere, but to have to mentally edit every page is annoying. Unfortunately, I'm afraid the people who edited this book didn't recognize all of the errors, and I feel that this publishing house needs to hire a more meticulous editor if they would like to be taken seriously."
2,Cowboy Geology at its best,"Discover or rediscover the excitement of geology with John McPhee as he travels the west with geologist Kenneth S. Deffeyes. As they explore the geological past in the American present you never know what will happen or where they will take you. They may get rich at an old silver mine, discover a past or future ocean, or touch an angular unconformity. To some extent they do all of this and to give a history of geology at the same time.The author effectively conveys the violence, drama, and epic immediacy of geological study. I look forward to future geological travels through his books."
2,O Magazine Ad Rich,"Like any popular magazine, O has lots of ads in it. Still I am glad I subscribed. I need to bring it to work and enter the code on that contest to see if I won anything. I'd love to meet Oprah someday but I'd be afraid to be on her show. I would like to see some caricatures of her regularly featured in her magazine. I'm a new subscriber, maybe they already had some I never saw. -Beth Hebert, Lake Charles, LA BIGDRAWS DOT COM"
2,Tour de Force J.L.L.,"[I assume that the title listed above is the 1971 unsold TV pilot released by the Magnum Music Group in 1992]. Most of Lewis' all-performance videos reveal Jerry Lee, the high-powered, quintessential Country rocker. Here we get an unprecedented view of the Ferriday Fireball as boogie woogie master, balladeer, guitarist, philosopher and Gospel harmonist - plus the chance to see Jackie Wilson and Carl Perkins deliver excellent renditions of their hits, in addition to sister Linda Gail Lewis deliver the goods mightily on the incredible duet with big brother on ""When You Wore A Tulip"" (Tiny Tim's & the Three Stooges' versions really don't compare). Seriously, that show opener is a show stopper - it belongs in a Television time-capsule. A perfect performance! There are some ""padded"" spots with lesser known groups and performers, but American Music fans should know about this tape; Jerry Lee Lewis fans must own it."
2,Good seller,My sister has wanted a bigger slow cooker for a long time. I was able to find the 8 1/2 quart at a reasonable price and also saved on shipping with this and a blender. I received it in good timing. It is already wrapped and under my tree along with my other sisters Christmas present. I will find out how she likes it after Christmas.Thank You
1,disappointrd,my original ac adapter for my kindle broke - an inexpensive adapter was advertised-i fell for a cheap fix and it did not work . i was disappointed .
1,terrible charger,"we only used this once then it won't charge anymore. we called customer service, was told charger is out of stock, have to wait for several weeks. now we have to find lawn mowing service which is not easy to find where we are at."
1,Unsatisfied,"The first package I ordered never came, so it was sent to me again. The second package did not work on my system so I returned it, having to pay 7 for postage myself. I am still waiting for a refund for the returned package."
2,Works well,Works well and no bells or whistles to distract the child from what they are doing. Easily portable to every bathroom in the house. Make sure you buy a step stool!
1,"Great book, Terribler narrator","What a marvelous novel. Perhaps not as good as Tinker Tailor... but few books are, even by Carre. The reason I gave this recording such a low rating is that I cannot STAND the narrator's delivery or voice. He reads the book as if perusing a last weeks newspaper-- no sense of pace, long pauses between the sentences. And that appalling voice! Dry and rasping like a used sandpaper but at same time rather effete! Dreadful.Unfortunately, the narrator Frederick Davidson is used on a lot of British audio recordings. I had to return his P.G. Wodehouse recordings for the above-mentioned reasons.For those who agree I am providing link to same title but with a different and better narrator.The Honourable Schoolboy: A BBC Full-Cast Radio Drama (BBC Radio Series)"
1,Lame,"This was not what I expect when I read an X-Files novel.I never once felt any sense of urgency or concern for the characters in the book. Scully and Mulder felt like they were actors being played by people trying to mimic what they saw on the show. The supporting cast of characters was so bland and undeveloped that when one of them would die I would scratch my head and try to remember just who they were.The ""Goblins"" were pretty boring too, not much to them other than they could change the color of the skin and they kept stabbing and killing random people.Also, is it just me or did the author spend waaaay too much time talking about what the characters were wearing and what they were eating?"
1,My mistake your gain,"Purchased this bulb to replace a burned out bulb. It was approx 1 or 2 millimeter too short (i.e, did not make solid contact with the spring loaded clamp these lamps have) so no light. Not sure if the bulb even works but since it doesn't fit snug I suspect no power is reaching it."
2,They become addictive,"I love the Creamy Peanut Bars, they've become addictive!! They taste like real food and remind me of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I have to watch myself to make sure I don't eat too many!"
1,Poor quality,"While it seemed okay during installation it later became aparent that it wouldn't aim high enough. Then in a couple of months it began to vibrate and move over time. Now its completely useless. Learn from my mistake, either buy a used one at the junkyard or buy an OEM from the dealer because this aftermarket mirror is junk."
2,The Love and Power Journal (by Lynn V Andrews),"I happened on this journal in a little bookstore in Black Mountain, NC in August of 1999. At the time my Dad was terminally ill. My brother, my Dad, and I were going through a most difficult time, emotionally. Anyway, I started working in this journal the first of September, 1999. It is a very wonderful tool for healing and uniting our inner selves. It requires DEEP introspection and therefore offers DEEP healing. I positively recommend this book, but remember before you start the journey be ready to do some real, sometimes painful, rewarding work. God Bless You!"
2,Good substitute for old Petromalt,My Siamese loved Petromalt and would beg for it. Can't buy it anymore because the formula changed. Bought Laxatone Catnip flavor but I have to mix it in with food because it is too runny to try to give to the cats on my finger. This Long Hair Cat hairball remedy is a little runny at first but then firms up and I can give this to my cats on my finger and they lick it off just like they did with the old Petromalt. I will buy this again.
1,Epson CX5400 problems,"I have had an Epson CX5400 for a little over a year and it just died. While it was working it was able to print photos and text at a decent quality, but it was terriblely slow. I called Epson to help troubleshoot my problem and they pretty much told me that the problem was caused by leaving the computer turn on when it was not in use. This was my first time hearing of this causing the problem. I believe I'm going to replace it with something different."
2,Where is the Widescreen Blu Ray?,"Ok, I love this movie.. The only problem is this. Where is the Widescreen Blu Ray Release? The studio needs to get in gear and release this!!"
1,Hard to believe,"I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book."
1,fragile,"I barely had this gun nozzle for a month before the handle cracked, shooting water into my face the next time I used it. I would only consider this product if you're very careful with your tools; otherwise, spend the extra money and get something more durable."
2,An excellent mystery,"This book by Ellis is an excellent mystery. Any mystery reader will enjoy the plot(s) and the characters which are to be found in the book. Without telling the story as others will have already done, it is well written, easy to read, and very interesting. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
2,Works well - simple,"Works well. It's really a simple chair that allows a baby to sit up in a batch. Your baby needs to be comfortable sitting up for this - if she/he is, it should work well."
2,price,"when i saw this toy at this site, i said hot expensive! then i went to the master replicas .com and i ordered it and the total came out to $146! so im like no way! then i cancelled the order. then i ordered it here and the price came out to $114 for the double pak wioth teion mendon with it so it is way cheaper over here."
1,Made in China,"Don't be fooled by the photo of this item, in which the compass is stamped ""made in USA"". This is a made in China pice of junk."
1,Price: $289.99 are you joking,you can get a professional hobby grade rc car for this price crap and waste of money do not buy this stupid cheap car that cost 20$ at wallmart lol
2,Andis hang up dryer,"Excellent. Combines all the elements that you could possibley want in one. Ionic, Quiet design, compact wall mount, built in night light. I'd buy it again. Can't be found in the usual stores."
1,Wireless speakers- do not work,"Got these speakers for my son as a holiday gift. They worked great and easy to set up in his apartment. After 3 weeks, they stopped working, had lots of interference and just were very poor quality. Had to return and buy a more expensive set, that is of much higher quality"
2,Allie and Jean-Paul fight to put the evil to rest.,"Allie has broken free of the evil Isnard's spell, and is back with her boyfriend, Isnard's twin Jean-Paul. But they have not even begun to grasp Isnard's unimaginable power. And traitor Michelle claims she's determined to be good again - but can Allie and Jean-Paul trust her, or will she betray them again? I highly reccomend this thriller to those who enjoyed the previous two Dark Hearts books. It's an exciting conclusion."
2,"Good Book, Chaotic Organization","This is a good book on appetizers. The ones I've tried are in fact easy to make and delicious. But I find this book difficult to use: it seems I have to flip through every page in order to find appropriate appetizers, all because the Table of Contents is wacko. Take, for example, some of the chapters: Bar Food Nibbles; Crudites for Small Parties and Crowds; Quick Cheese Appetizer Wonders; Sizzling Appetizers from the Grill and Oven; Meatball Appetizers; New Ideas for Pizzas. These are overlapping categories. Quick Cheese Appetizers can certainly be Bar Food Nibbles, and Bar Food Nibbles can include New Ideas for Pizzas as well as Sizzling Appetizers.No clear thought went into organizing these chapters. Busy cooks need easy-to-use books."
2,Great,Just a really neat story of someone overcoming their circumstances and following their dream--despite how hopeless things look.
1,Please publish wire lengths,"After about fifteen years of great performance cutting great cheeses, my cutter's wire snapped. I strongly prefer to repair rather than replace -- in this case, an otherwise perfectly good remainder of a cheese cutter. Amazon did not list the length of these replacement wires; applicable cheese cutter model numbers were listed, however, but none was mine. So I eyeballed it. And I missed. Wires too short. I did not return the wires to Amazon because their low price didn't justify the bother. But there's the customer service consideration. Amazon's is splendid and is one of its most valuable assets. Publish the wire length, boys and girls. Yours are the kinds of customers who want to know. And we appreciate and value what you do for us. What would Mr. Bezos do?"
2,Wonderful Book That Explains the Evolution in Styles of Jewelry,"I would recommend the book ""Costume Jewelry: The Great Pretenders"" to anyone who collects, or is even interested in the way our jewelry has changed throughout the times.I have pieces of jewelry that I picked up over thirty years ago in resale boutiques. I wanted to know more about the history of the pieces, and this book was a real help.The author, Lyngerda Kelley, explained how the events of each time period, such as World War 2, changed how designers and manufacturers made and marketed their costume jewelry to the average man and woman. It is a fascinating book. It is also one I will refer to often as I collect more vintage pieces of jewelry.I highly recommend this book to any jewelry collector or seller."
2,"A Wonderful, Informative Children's Book","My daughter, who is 4, loves bumble bees. She was attracted to the cover of this book so we first took it out of our library to see. It is written both as a basic story, and then with some more scientific facts as well. When you read it aloud you can choose to read the scientific tidbits along with the bumble bee, life-cycle story, or you can skip them until next time. We both enjoyed learning about the Queen Bee and her life, especially what happens in wintertime. The pictures are detailed and beautiful. You actually get to see the bumble's long, sticky tongue. A great book for kids interested in bees and nature and their parents too!"
2,"I am so not the groupie type, but","Maybe I'm not in the business of music and just some fun loving thespian, but as the first official reviewer of The End, I want to highly recommend this album. I heard it purely by accident at an agency and I am in love with everything about it.I think this band is the next Stones, and I want to be the first to call it! All my friends at work love it and had to have their own copies.I am a groupie, and I am converting everyone around me. Go guys!!! That's it for me. My guy thinks they are the ""bomb"" too!"
1,Carnosaur 4,"If you've seen the first three Carnosaur movies, you've seen this one. They take footage from the first three and add a little bit. The first three movies were cheesy fun, this one was just...no."
2,Random Anecdotes,"I read this after I read ""War and Peace"" and was interested in Tolstoy. I was very impressed with Gorky's insight. This book is clearly written, and fairly interesting. It is full of random anecdotes - but in a familiar, sweet way, so it doesn't seem disjointed. If you would like to know some more details about some Russian authors, this is a good book. A part that stands out is Gorky hitting his landlady with a shovel, and the very last chapter about the way Alexander Blok treated a prostitute. It is simply written and wonderful to read."
1,cheaply made,It is impossible to purchase these in the store. This is the second time I have had to order one from Amazon. The quality is extremely poor. The handle broke away from the carafe and it is impossible to use it without the top. Krups used to be know for quality now I suggest to look for another brand for espresso!
1,Waste of Time,"This movie or documentary is a waste of time...plain and simple.Tupac, what did you expect? Did you think that the thug life would allow you to have a happy and fulfilling life? Think again. If your watching this movie to remember Tupac, then go for it. I wished I could get my money back."
2,Great Force FX,"This is a great FX lightsaber. Since this is a more later version than the original fx's(i.e. Anakins AOTC) it is much more durable and lasts longer. This is not meant to fight with but thats obvious since it is a collectable. However the stunt coordinator for episodes 1-3 did fight with Hayden Christensen on TV. They fought for about 10 minutes (pretty hard like they actually do on the set and not just for show). One of them did end up cracking a bit mainly because Hayden hit hard to get Rick to lose his but did not shatter just cracked. So for as much money as you're spending for one of these don't fight. (By the way, Hayden ended up winning that fight)."
1,Unfortunately the horrible plastic smell doesn't go away with time.,"I bought one in 2009. Hated the horrible plastic smell. Now in 2011, that horrible plastic smell STILL has not gone away. Would not buy again and it's put me off any kind of plastic product of this type. WHAT were they thinking? Yick."
2,Underrated,"This is one of my favorite Newman albums. Mr. Sardonic is at his best here, from the album cover(a comment on the success of Little Criminals), to the very last song. Favs include The story of a rock and roll band(a tribute to ELO)Pretty Boys, William Brown, and Half a Man. Extremely under-rated, it's a must have for fans of Randy Newman."
1,6 deck card shuffler by Pachi Paradice,"This 6 deck card shuffler by Pachi Paradice, which I bought on 4/25/09, does not work. One side of it does not operate and I have used different batteries in it to be sure that isn't the problem but the gears for that side will not turn. I bought it at the request of a friend and she didn't use it for several days and I didn't know on receipt that it didn't work. I don't have the paper work that came with it, evidently she threw it away. Do I have any recourse with this in a refund or replacement?"
1,Keoki crazy meth freak?,"I'm tired of people saying how great keoki is .Some went as far as saying he is a god , I strongly disagree .Moonshine records should be concentrating there efforts on some of there lesser known artists . Only thing good that came out of this album is the first track by Coldcut ""Every Home A Prison"""
1,HOTMETAL MELTDOWN !,"Hotmetal Pro? I will say that this software is useful, IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WEB SITES! It is easy to use,for basic pages.There are many features which were forgotten.My advice is whether you are a novice or professional webmaster I would first look at IBM WEBSPHERE HOMEPAGE BUILDER it is a much ""simpler"" and ""useful"" software package than Hotmetal Pro will ever be. The best part is there about the same price.Check it out!"
2,Love this product,I have used this protein powder for a while and I love the taste. It is the best I have tried so far.
1,Ani's Worst Album,"She's been on a downslide for the last couple of years, but to judge by this cd its getting worse. She tries to ryhme words with themselves, she continues on the completely mined-out vein of politically complaining that has replaced all her other subject matter lately, she's forgotten any way to show emphasis or go for emotional impact other than just repeating the first verse as the last verse, apparently...I can't find a good thing to say about this one, which is a real shame because Ani is one of the only artists out there today who could fairly and without exaggeration be called both a poet and a geniusShe needs to take some time off and get some new material and new inspiration though, and until she does I'm afraid all her cds will be as bad as, or worse than, this one. I would give it zero stars if i could"
2,Administrator's Guide,"This is a well rounded and well thought out book on world software. The book begins with an overview of JDE and its products, starting with world software (the subject of the book) and then oneworld software, (the newer JDE software product). The book describes at a high level how to begin, manage, and execute projects, such as modifying applications or creating interfaces to applications outside of JDE.It then describes in detail how to work with the software, make changes, optimize an AS/400, and other maintenance issues. Finally, the book discusses what you need to know if you intend to upgrade your system to oneworld.A number of things in the book were particularly helpful to me. For example, working with JDE batch processes, and the troubleshooting section were helpful. The authors, Panza and Edelstein seem to know the product inside out and communicate information effectively."
2,If you bake - or want to - you need one,"There's not that much to say, is there? This dough blender works perfectly. It's much faster and more comfortable than the old ""two knives"" method. And it's sure easier to clean than a food processor. For making biscuits, pie or tart crust, or any other kind of baked pastry product, it's a great tool to have. It costs less than $10, so if you're thinking about getting it, stop thinking and do it.A tip: if you're good at planning ahead (I'm not, unfortunately), you might want to try putting it in the refrigerator an hour or so before using it, which will help to ensure that the butter doesn't melt excessively before you can finish cutting it into the dough."
1,disappointed,"The shoes seemed to be just what I wanted, but in the left shoe the front of the sole was not glued down so the inner sole was all bunched up and uncomfortable. Cannot recommend this product - besides the fact that I had to pay shipping both ways was not a good experience."
1,Pass on this one.....,"Doesn't any one find it unacceptable for a family to have multiple-sexual encounters with the same guest (stranger) in their home? This film borders on incestous behavior. It is not worth the time of day and has little, if any, redeeming value. As far as putting it on DVD....what a waste of energy. I rated this film ""2 stars"" because even though I very much did not like the film, the 1 star rating stipulation of ""hatred"" is too strong of a term. Why bother to invest the emotional & mental energy of hatred? I would rather stay healthy. Irresponsible behavior is quite a problem within our society today. We seem to CELEBRATE that which is tasteless, worthless, and degenerate behavior. Just wanted to weigh-in and represent another perspective :-) I do however very much appreciate Patrick Dempsey as an actor. Have a good Day!"
1,Not as good as truvia,"Taste was rather chemical - this product isn't in the same class as truvia. Cheap price shows through, I can tolerate it with more spices but wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not Your Average Ozzy Album,"This album is kind of different than Ozzy's previous two or any to follow. It is very good though. It is a little more pop oriented, and a little more moody. Jake Lee's guitar playing is just as good as anything, though. Center Of Enternity is the best song on the album, and one of Ozzy's all-time best. Some lame songs, like So Tired keep this from being Ozzy's best album ever . I love all of it, though. The title track is one of Ozzy's most famous songs, and it is very good."
2,Ring Christmas Bells,This is a visual and audio extravaganza that is truly breathtaking ! The amount of effort expended to produce this feast for the eyes and ears was readily apparent. Not to be missed!!! Ron McCargar
1,Horrible quality,"I recently bought this toner cartridge and the print was very uneven, light and dark, smudged and looked horrible. I gently shook it to make sure the powder was evenly distributed and tried several times over several days to get a decent print job. It never improved. I have since ordered a cartridge from another vendor and the quality is excellent on that one, so it wasn't a problem with my printer."
1,OK,Pretty general. Not much detail instruction. Pretty pics that are not very infomative. Wish I had bought another! OH well.
1,Crystals in general are NOT the way to go.,"Crystals in general are a poor choice for litter. Clay litter allows clumps to form wherever the cat pees. The clumps are easy to remove. Crystals however do not clump. Thus, the pee-saturated areas are harder to scoop out of the box. Why is it a big deal if pee stays in the litter box? Because cats are very clean animals and prefer to void in pee-free, odor-free zones. If their boxes smells of pee, then, the cats are more likely to start peeing in places other than the box. Do NOT get rid of your cat, because it dislikes using the litter box!!! More often than not, a switch to odor-free, clay litter will cure any litter box avoidance. If you don't want to clean your litter box daily, then, don't get a cat. (I have a beautiful cat that I bought from the pound. I used the crystals with her at first, and she preferred peeing on the carpet. I switched to the clay, clumping litter. Guess what happened? I think you know.)"
1,Poor Quality,Very little plot in this movie. Some great actors that are portrayed in lesser roles. Wouldn't suggest watching. Two more words.
2,I haven't read it....,"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering if this was the same Alissa in The Christy Miller Series?"
2,Great price and it works fine,"My older Acer laptop's built in wireless card quit working, so I got this to be able to go online using my Belkin N wireless router. I just followed the instructions and loaded the driver software before initially plugging the card in. When the laptop is powered down, I did find that it's best to wait until the laptop is fired up before inserting the card. As soon as the card is inserted, it connects to my network in just a few seconds with no issues."
2,"Twisted, in a good way!","It was a bizarre, twisted ride through Florida that intertwined the lives of some very unlikely characters and kept me interested until the end. Let's just say an embezzler, a few teenagers, some cops, some hit men, a loner, and a few average people get wrapped up in a seemingly harmless kid's game, an assassination plot, and an arms deal gone awry. If that doesn't peak your interest, I don't know what will!"
1,Read this before you buy!,There is a problem with the CD not working on alot of CD drives. You should check on the Sims website to make sure you don't have one of those drives.
1,Not great...,"I bought this cable so that I could play video games on my computer using my monitor as a TV. I know it's possible, because my oldest brother has the exact same cable and did the same thing. After installing everything, it didn't work. I then uninstalled everything, reinstalled it, and now my computer won't recognize the cable at all. Either I didn't uninstall it ""properly,"" or my cable went bad."
1,Terrible movie,"I'm obviously in a minority here. But IMO the movie just sucked. The thing that irritated me throughout the movie was the darkness and by that I mean the absense of light. The lighting is artificially dimmed for effect and it just doesn't work. Nobody works and lives in such poor light. The black and white film noirs work beautifully, but this movie seems stage-managed. Amongst contemporary movies, the lighting in &quot;Dark City&quot; was very natural and fit in well with the theme of the movie. This is a one gimmick movie and it got old within the first 5 minutes. I count this, along with &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; as amongst the worst 10 movies I have seen."
1,Iron board holder,Sorry I have the wrong kind of ironing board for this. The picture makes it look like it will stay but it doesn't.
1,A seeming contradiction.,"Mr. Packer confuses me a bit. He seems to say 'seek Godly knowledge but don't dig too deep lest you become conceited'. All Christians need to 'know' for certain the entire gospel of Christ, how can anyone follow God unless they 'know' exactly what He's saying to us? The Corinthians had a 'wrong' knowledge of God and that's why Paul was admonishing them because they were following 'after men' (wrong knowledge) rather than Christ. The 'knowledge of God' is good and brings humility but the 'commandments of men'corrupts."
2,Impressed,I found this book interesting and anxious to try it out. I haven't read the whole book but am impressed so far.
2,Great base line DVD player.,"I have been shopping for a player for several months. When I saw this one at [local store], I snagged it. Great price and all the features I wanted. However, I got it home, plugged it in and ""POP"", dead air. Returned it and got the second one home and plugged it into the TV and surround system. WOW!! Great picture and sound!!! Plays all the DVD menus and music cds. Really recommend this model for a basic DVD player."
1,creepy and disturbing,"I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have ""a bit on the side."" And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Poor Quality,"Based on other reviews I must have received one of the few lemons. The trigger button popped off while removing the packing material and would not stay snapped into place when using the saw. I could not get any oil to flow to the chain no matter how hard I pressed. The cutting power even on 4"" limbs seemed weak but this may have also been a lack of chain oil. All in all I was very disappointed with this saw."
2,Scleroderma,"This Book was such an easy read, easy to follow and has helped me understand this condition which I have. A must read if you have Scleroderma!!! Very imformative!!!!"
2,LOVE.....,"I WORE THESE SO MUCH OVER THE SUMMER WITH JEANS, DRESSES , EVERYTHING! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH THAT I GOT MY MOM A PAIR!"
1,Is this a Soap Opera?,"I'm reading the Tower books with my kids, and I'm about ready to call it quits! Number three...yet another book providing little satisfaction in the story. I'm feeling like this series is more about selling books than anything else! I feel like we're tuning in to the never-ending soap opera at several bucks a pop. At this rate, Tal's mom will die of old age before he ever gets her out of that coma!"
2,Two sides to the synth!,"This marvelous album consists of short, melodic songs like Speed Of Life, Breaking Glass, What In The World, Sound & Vision and long, dark pieces like Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall and Subterraneans. My favorites include the catchy Sound & Vision with its poetic lyrics and brilliant guitar hook and of course the atmospheric Breaking Glass which inspired Nick Lowe's ""I Love The Sound Of Breaking Glass"" on his Pure Pop For Now People album. The short pop pieces are strangely addictive in their robotic minimalism, while the long instrumentals are quite evocative but they would probably appeal more to lovers of classical music than your average Bowie fan. (Those who like Gorecki's ""Three Sorrowful Songs"" would love them). On Low, Bowie took synth music in two very different directions. This was a groundbreaking album for its time and remains a remarkable listening experience although I definitely prefer the first part."
2,John Williams' Finest Hour,"Schindler's List has long been regarded as one of the finest films ever created and I will not dispute this one iota. For anyone that appreciates this film, it can easily be said as well that its success owes much thanks to the incredible score by John Williams. The main them is simple yet will be one of those few works that gives you goosebumps and chills you to the core.If you appreciate classical music, love scores, or just feel the Schindler's List is a moving masterpiece, you owe it to yourself to listen to Williams work and make sure to have the Kleenex by your side.A masterpiece in film scoring that few composers have ever come close to achieving.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"
1,Thinly Veiled Hatred For Others,This is nothing but Maher's hatred for others who believe differently than him put to film. You would be better off watching something by Penn & Teller if you want entertainment from the atheist point of view.
1,WORST GUI I have ever seen,"The GUI (the way it looks) for this program is horrible. Seriously, it's confusing and an abomination. It's the exact opposite of most other Mac software - clean and polished and easy to use without reading the help manual. Quicken for Mac is anything but.I actually bought VPC just to run the windows version on my mac...."
2,One of Disney's best.,"Before seeing this movie, I was in the mindset that Disney movies were getting progressively worse after the death of Walt. I was terribly wrong. Beauty and the Beast was the first in a string of absolutely marvelous movies made by Disney. Aladdin, The Lion King...etc. The characters in this were lovable and compassionate and kind throughout the whole movie. Also, Beauty and the Beast had the old charmingly innocent 'he is good' 'he is bad' mentality. This movie is masterfully done to make it enjoyable for people of all ages to watch. Just recently I saw a toddler watching it. Then later, I noticed a group of 15-year-olds watching it and laughing at the jokes, then an adult or two peeked in and were enjoying it. The subtlties pull the story-line through for adults, and the product in itself makes it one of the best Disney movies for everyone."
1,very poor,Colloquial Cambodian......A complete course if you happen to buy the book too. CD pack is usless by itself. Have to buy the book too. A great marketing ploy by Mr Smyth.CD wastes alot of time.... keeps saying... In this lesson 16 we will explore....blah blah.. Then In this next lesson number 17 we shall look at exercise 22 in the book.....( if you happen to have the book). You just hear alot of Khmer words with no English to explain what they are saying. CD has no order. Very poor to try to learn any words....even like Hello or thankyou. If you want to learn Khmer... dont buy this. To waste even more time it even has several interviews (all in Khmer) about how difficult it was to farm under the Lon Nol Goverment...blah blah blah.. More of a History lesson Than a Language program. To understand the interviews you have to be Khmer as there is no English translations. ( or perhaps thats written in a different book that you have to buy aswell.)
1,"Quick, get this girl some singing lessons!","This is about the worst album I've ever listened to. DO NOT BUY THIS CD (I didn't, I just listened to my friend's copy). It will be a huge waste of money because Hilary Duff can't sing to save her life.First of all, all her songs are enhanced by computers or dubbed with many, many background voices. And she STILL sounds terrible! So her voice must have been really, really, really bad before they enhanced it.And most of her songs are completely boring and unintelligible; she sings about love and tween-stuff but it's SO obvious she doesn't know diddly. Half the time, I can barely understand what the hell she's talking about. This CD is sure to drive you insane. If you like Hilary Duff now (WHY?!?!?!), then you'll hate her after listening to this CD.She should stop pretending she knows how to sing, get some voice lessons, and then try again. This CD is truly painful to listen to."
1,worst Sally Hansen product,"Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat is definitely the worst Hansen product I've tried and may be the worst nail product I've ever used. I am on my third application, shaking the bottle gently and applying -- once on nude clean nails and twice over nail polish. In each instance, the No Chip cracked and flaked in one day. I used polish remover and tried again. I'm finally doing what I haven't done before...I'm taking this stuff back to the store and politely asking for a refund. I think if more ladies do this, instead of feeling ashamed at buying a useless product, we would end up with better products (money talks, girls)!"
1,Ditto,Another teacher still looking for a pencil sharpener that will last more than a couple of months. This ain't it either.
2,rudy ray moore is ahead of his time,this man is a genius.rappers are saying things he sayed almost 25 years ago now.rapping and doing karate all at once and the dub voices that is crazy genius.i enjoy his work alot.i've seen comedians who couldn't hold rudy's jock strap with there hands and somebody else's.the man has his own style and vision.
2,Excellent one,I've been using this watch for more than 6 months now. Its really a nice affordable swiss watch.
2,These little suckers are great!!!,"I own a wide variety of Bessey clamps, pipe clamps, quickgrip clamps and specialty clamps. As a firm believer in the maxim that ""you can never have too many clamps"" I bought 5 of these last year. I am so impressed by their ease of use that they are the ones that I reach for most often. Needless to say, they won't be of much help in gluing up panels (unless you're trying to improve the allignment at the ends of the boards). I use these clamps at the drill press, band saw, router table and table saw to secure temporary fences. I also use them any time that I mount a tool (hollow-chisel mortiser; grinder) or my dovetail jig on my workmate. I use them when dry-fitting face frames to hold the pieces in alignment and anywhere that I need a small clamp with good holding power. They also excel in clamping laminations and I've used them for that enough that I realized that I should have bought more."
2,Not Just a Rant,Lundberg is one of the great contrarians of the last century. He is generally outraged and only sometimes outrageous.This book is an impassioned and intelligent look at what the Constitution can and can't do. This isn't just an opinion piece. Lundberg is firmly grounded in looking at history to understand the dynamics of American power. Quite an accomplishment.
1,disappointing,"I was led to believe that this was a powerful machine. Yeah right! I even called every company selling this product and they all told me how great it was and how powerful it was. I need something strong because of the noise in my apartment building. The reviews on here were also great, so I took my chances. When I received it, I was terribly disappointed. It was no more powerful that the Marpac 980, which I also think is not nearly powerful enough for my situation. I hear people say that these machines are too loud. I can't understand how they come up with that. I returned the Marsona 330, and then I tried the Ecotones Duet---I am finally happy."
1,MORE LIKE DROOPY EYES,"EVIL EYES is a derivative a la Stephen King/Dean Koontz variety. A failing screenwriter (Adam Baldwin) is approached by a mysterious ""agent"" (Udo Keir) to write the screenplay based on a true story of a screenwriter who went mad and killed his mother, father and wife. As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding. Vague film making at the least."
2,Indispensable Price Guide,When it comes to concise and easy to use price guides to Lionel Trains I have found Greenberg's Guides to be invaluable. It breaks the catalogue numbers down into eras or distinct ranges of years of production and lists price ranges based on condition in a very orderly fashion. If you sell or buy on eBay this is a valuable tool. Greenberg's Lionel Trains Guides and publications are all first rate and come highly recommended.
1,"Save your money, buy a game","I broke down and bought a game shark (way overpriced) only for it to tell me that it was not compatible with my system. Apparently, I needed to buy an upgrade cd. For how much I have no idea because I brought it back, got my money back and bought a game."
2,Good value,"It was easy to assemble. And lightweight. The quality of ply is poor but the price is also low. The paint quality is decent. The quality of screws were not so great. So, be careful when you are tightening.Overall, a decent kid's table for a decent price."
2,Tranquility System offers valuable advice for modern living,"Having worked in a fast-paced, high stress environment, I quickly learned the importance the stress relief. The Tranquility System was an invaluable guide to me in my quest for relaxation. It is filled with useful tips on how to relax even when you are in a stressful situation (which of course is when you really need it) and how to incorporate stress relief into your daily life. I particularly appreciated the anecdotes the authors share about the individuals they have worked with, as they personalize the damaging effects stress can have on our relationships with others, and on our own spirits. The relaxation techniques outlined by Forest and Light are clearly explained and easy to practice. This book has taught me that it is possible to achieve a sense of inner peace no matter how chaotic my environment - I highly recommend it."
2,"Gritty, raunchy, and gripping","The first book was a bit unsettling. Kildar continues in that vein, but the action and characters grab you and keep you in the seat until it's over.Definately not recommended for children or the thin-skinned. Very strong language and graphic violence are throughout the book. Some scenes are designed to revolt the reader, but if you're looking to get your jollies, look elsewhere."
1,Worst of Arcade Fire?,I was really excited by being introduced to some of Arcade Fire's latest work (Neon Bible) so I bought this and was amazed at how bad it was. There is like one song worth keeping the CD for and the rest is like a bad rehersal.
1,Slow and tired,This book is so slow and boring that if it was a movie you would get up and walk out. The people that gave this book 5 stars must be friends and family of the author. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because 0 stars wasn't an option.
1,Disappointing and Over Produced,"There was not much to impress on this album. If you're a Rafferty fan, then this should be the last album to buy in your research or listening enjoyment on the musician. Track after track is rife with over production traits like heavy drum machines, and keyboard/synthesizer riffs. The only standout was the hard rocker ""Does He Know What He's Taken On"" A solid song is ""The Light of Love"" but that's only because it's a soft tune sans the hard over-bearing drum machine. Throughout the album are the typical pessimistic views of the rock industry as a whole. This is especially clear on the opening track ""Time's Caught Up On You"". The low price on the album is the best thing about the work, so if you do choose to get this one, just chalk the seven dollar loss up to a venture."
2,AudioLearn PCAT,"Great content, however, I did not listen to the material for very long because the reader's diction left something to be desired. He slurred the pronunciation of scientific terms. Example: ""thi-mine"" instead of ""thi-a-mine""; pronounced ""anti"" unlike a scientist, etc. I found myself correcting his pronunciation and missing out entirely on the contents. If you think the folksy pronunciation will not bother you, get this study guide. It's very well written and progresses in a logical manner. The author did a fabulous job of gathering and presenting the information."
1,no service,Never received the game and did not get my money back. Emailed company never got response. Very unhappy
2,"What I wanted, but too expensive.","I was pleased to receive this item right on time, and to find that it was actually an Apple product as they claimed. I do wish, however, that it was not so awfully expensive."
1,Really Bad,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. Really, really bad acting. I can't believe that this show lasted even an entire season. Don't waste your money."
1,color washed off,"Color washed off within one month of use and its a little too bulky for a newborn. Recommend trying ""Baby Buddy Bear Pacifier Holder"" Love them."
1,There are better choices...,"After listening to a couple of tracks, I was very disappointed in this CD. Nothing prepared me for a collection of live performances recorded from Tom's TV appearances. Even though there are quite a few tracks on this CD, I'm not sure I would have forked over (money) for it (...). The instrumentation is weak, but Tom belts out each tune with the same enthusiasm which makes him the legend he is... Buy something else!"
1,Poor Quality,"I received this product as a Christmas gift. It worked for 2-3 weeks until segments in the indoor display started failing. I then went through all of the other frustrations of replacing batteries and trying to get the two units to communicate, until the battery cover for the outside unit broke. Lifespan of <3 months. I recommend this product be avoided."
1,Dont Bother,"After it working fine for about 2 months, It got to wet one day from the shower head leaking and the radio broke, the clock is broken as well and unable to reset to the correct time. Its a cute idea and the radio sounded crappy when it did work but for the price I expected it."
1,Where are the Peel Sessions?,I don't understand why they didn't include the 6 extra John Peel Sessions that appeared on the original UK CD.
1,"Quite possibly the worst ""documentary"" ever.","I agree with the other person who posted on this being a ""mockumentary"". I saw this ""film"" and can only describe it as utter trash and not even worth wasting the plastics on to release on DVD. Michael Moore's views aren't all that positive and his second-rate b-movie style filming in this tv-like program is just pathetic. Don't waste your time and don't give it a second thought. Buy a National Geographic Documentary instead. It'd be more educational and worth your money."
1,Suggested Wrong Ink,"Very very upset that I can't return this WRONG Ink pack. When ordering printer, I also ordered the ""suggested"" ink as a back up. Well, by the time the printer ran out of ink and I went to put in the ""suggested ink"", low and behold ""WRONG INK"". Now, it""s too late to return."
1,"Flimsy, poorly built. Fails after a year or two. Brush heads very expensive","Failed after a year or so. THey replaced it. But now it failed again and they want exorbitant shipping charges to replace it. DON'T tell them it corroded then they charge you even more! Don't get the charger replaced, then they charge you even more.The brushes don't last long and are very expensive to replace!This uses regular plug contacts so in a wet sink area they corrode badly. Must scrape off the green rot regularly to get it to work.Poor construction. Can't open it to replace batteries or to clean the contacts."
1,lifeless restaurant muzak,"i like some of the other downtempo stuff, but i've listened to this one three times now and i still can't ever tell when it's on except that i become impatient and have to will myself to let it play all the way through. it just flat-out bores the s**t out of me. ten year old future sound of london lps had much more of a flow to them than this does. what, these guys play this music in their restaurant? ok, i guess. salad-eating music. but turn it down."
2,I love this book!,I love this book because it is so helpful! It has given me peace during a time that brings up bad memories.
1,Boring and Unfocused,I agree with the disappointed reader from Seattle. I too found this book stuffed with mediocre out-takes from the middle-brow Better Homes and Gardens magazine. It's hard to read and a graphic mess. Those glowing reviews must all be from relatives and close friends!
2,"Good mix of rock, pop, and funk","I bought this CD for my 2 year old daughter who couldn't stop singing ""Sunday Morning."" Well, soon I couldn't stop singing it either. Actually, I like all of the songs on this album, which is not something I can say about every album I own.My most preferred songs are: The Sun, Tangled, Sunday Morning, and Sweetest Goodbye.It is just an easy album to listen to. Not thrashy, full of soul. If you like Maroon 5 from what you hear on the radio, give this CD a go!"
2,My jeep liftgate is like new again!,"My 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee's liftgate supports were done, they would always drop the lift on my head as I tried to load groceries into it. These were easy to install with the help of a second person."
2,Survive Your Cancer Review,I found this book to be well written and chock full of valuable invormation. My hat is off to Barbara for taking the time to help keep others well informed.
1,It's enough to make a grown horror movie fan cry,"I thought adding color to this classic of the horror genre was the worst that could ever happen to it, I was wrong. The new footage stands out from the rest of the film (in a bad way), almost all the original zombie footage is gone and the new zombies should shut-up because they're far too noisey,the new folley effects are as subtle as a train wreck, and the new soundtrack is nothing to write home about either. As they say in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" enter (or should I say view) this new cut of the film at your own risk!"
2,Excellent!,Good group. Saw them in St Paul in the early 90's. It's a good show. They are a nice alternative to commercial rock..and they remain fresh today. :)
1,Expected better,"Having read the Dragonlance series, I told myself that the second half of the book would hold more promise as a way to get through the slow first half, which I believed was perhaps necessary as groundwork.The gnome world was, in my opinion, unnecessary. The switching of worlds was at times rather tedious to read, especially the gnome world, which I skipped over almost entirely at the second half of the book, without missing much.The ending was rather ridiculous. Sure, it's fantasy, but then there should also be some rationalisation in fantasy too. Certain things at the finale occurred without a clear explanation, although the reader can link the events together and explain what causes what. However, why certain things are that way aren't explained at all.In short, I felt short-changed and there was a feeling of relief after finishing the book."
1,So so very sad,"I watched the remake series of Land of the Lost when I was a kid and loved the series, and later I watched the original as reruns on tv land. They were both great, adventurous, entertaining shows. This movie is horrible. It simply makes fun of the stories that were these great shows. I knew the moment I saw the advertisments for this movie that it was going to be bad. Especially when it was announced that it would star Will Farrel. At that point I knew that this movie was going to be nothing more than stupid jokes aimed at making fun of the original shows.So glad I avoided going to see this in the theater."
2,Good case,"So far this is the best case I've found. The rubberized parts make the case easy to grip. Convenient openings provide easy access to the docking port, click wheel and topside controls. I agree with previous reviewers that the case will tend to get dirtier than others. If this is a concern try the black.For protection and utility, this case is excellent. Looks are great, but will probably degrade over time. Highly recommended."
1,Not dependable,"I agree that longevity is not in the design specs. I bought one and it worked for less than a year, got a replacement, and that one died even sooner. Didn't bother to replace that one. I also had two of the mini ones that plug into the outlet and have a light. One still working after quite a few years, the other, dead. 1 out of 4 is not very good. One note - it does seem to take odors out of the air. I have 4 cats and I think it helped somewhat, but not at the price they want for them. I would give $30 for a floor model if I thought it would keep running. As for cleaning the air - I don't think so."
1,Flexible Arm Scam,"A few of years ago, I bought a dual headset TV Ears. Technically it performed very well in terms of amplitude and tone control as well as allowing independent control of each headset. However, within a relatively short time, the ""flexible"" arms of one of the headsets snapped. I was able to glue the sections but it simply cracked in another part of the ""flexible"" arm. When I reported this to the company, I was told to simply BUY a replacement headset. In rapid order (at intervals of a few months), both ""flexible"" arms of both headsets cracked. In short, although doctors may recommend this product, according to its advertisement, it clearly needs an engineering assessment and truly flexible arms.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT without checking whether the above manufacturing improvement has been made!!"
2,Great Book,"This is a great book, brings back childhood memories and my kids love it too. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,small Child sized/ or extra small head and or no hair,"I guess if you have a tiny head and no hair this might fit. Otherwise this is too small. But, If you have no hair, then why would you need this? It hurts getting it on and off, and is simply too small."
1,Armageddon on the High Seas!,"Octopus can easily be used as an educational tool. Some of the things I learned are: 1. Fat can help protect you from explosions. 2. Berlin, Germany, 1952, happening place to be. 3. Unrestrained beakers do not break in submarine crashes. 4. You can't swim with a skirt. 5. Corrosion does not occur to metal barrels at the bottom of the sea.I was just looking for a good movie for a Sunday night, but it is terrible..."
2,listen to this and wonder how you could have missed it!,"Vambo rules! If you're into crazy music, ranging from almost soul like sounds to pure rock, mingled with the best guitar solo's you've ever heard: buy this one! And the voice of Alex is as complex as you will ever hear: Scottish sounding English with broad American hints. A guess where he really came from.If you are thinking about Bowie, well ...almost. Zappa? Close. SAHB rules.It's a gas, folks, hey hey"
1,How can anyone call this anything but horrible,"You go into this movie expecting it to be terrifying. It's not. The main thing wrong with this movie is that it is based on a true story. While, at the end, the only witness to give any details was Ben Mitchell(Nathan Phillips) who spent the duration of the ""horror"" part of the movie secluded from Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi). The entire premise of the movie was the torture and murder of these two girls, yet there was no one around to give any statement as to what actually happened. Their torture was the only part that could have been susspenseful, yet again - it wasn't. The one sole acheivement was Mick Taylors creepy laugh in the back seat of the car. I spent the movie sitting there waiting for it to get good, and it just ended."
2,Great Resource,"As a newly certified wound care specialist nurse I have had a need to build a resource library. Habif's Clnical Dermatology was recommended by my instructors and I am pleased with the quality of both text and photos. The color photos are invaluable, the descriptive text and treatment suggestions are exactly what I was hoping for in a reference format."
1,Broke,"Ok, I have to flip flop from my previous review. It was working good, but just the other day after cleaning the plates and being sure to follow instructions of how to insert them correctly, the device doesn't work anymore. No lights no nothing. I've tried a few different things to get it to work, but without success. Its dead. The reliability of this product is now questionable in my view."
1,Utterly boring!!!,"I am a HUGE animal lover and avid book reader, but this book was just plain boring! This is the first book that I've ever put away half-way through and just gave up. The story would have made for a mildly amusing magazine article, but there is not enough material for a book. Luckily for me I suffer from insomnia and this book always did the trick to put me right to sleep!"
1,Another toaster failure,"I bought this toaster because I was impressed with the performance of a Cuisinart ""Commercial"" toaster in a motel breakfast room. I like toast to be toasted, not warmed, and at first, this toaster really performed. But now, one year later, this toaster is just tepidly warming the bread. It's on its way to the charity bin, sadly."
1,SUTURE SELF,Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
2,Mean Rythm Indeed.,"This is a classic example of what the good reverend B. Gibbons and his cohorts can dish out when their on the money.With his sharpened Peso pick attacking his guitar strings emitting those signature whistling lead solo's coming at you through several Expandora distortion pedals you know he means business.His voice is as raw as the Grand Canyon,the songs are tight as a closed fist and the drums and bass are funky and primal, what a great combo.Yes indeedy folks it's all there in one neat package, so what are you waiting forhave a sip of Rythmeen you'll feel better for it.Oooohh Yeah!!"
1,Ruined disc,When I need to relax I do it by watching these old video episodes of the old Hawaii five-0. I recognise the way of living and enjoy looking - and laughing at the stories. Though by not checking every disc to be allright prior to running them I discovered too late that one disc was ruined at the purchase. It is impossible to see any of the episodes of disc six. Make sure this doesnt happen to you.
1,Brother Toner TN 430,Product works properly as supposed to work.Only concern is the yield. Not happy with the yield.Lasted about 1000 pages and now it shows toner low.For 1000 pages of yield I would buy a compatible one forhalf the price.
2,Great Learning Tool,My daughter used this to help her learn addition & subtraction. Its agreat tool for children who are being introducted to math.
1,Disappointing,"Too much bass, weak mid-range. Music sounds muddled and lacks clarity. Imaging is OK. Maybe good for hard rock and heavy metal, but not suitable for classical music, country, jazz etc. Bose MediaMate is better."
1,Putrid Euclid,"Don't bother downloading this book. Whether read on my PC or on my wife's I-Pad, the text is illegible and the figures distorted. Too bad, since the Heath edition is classic."
2,Loved it but need more trouble shootomg Info.,THis is a very good unit ir fits nice and being hard of hearing it bring the sound so realestic that I forget I have them on. the only objection I have is that if the soumd on the TV is not up far enougfh than you will have it on and all of a suddeb you get loud static. I had to callwhich was not toll free and talk to a tech and thats when I found out about the TV sound was to low. that shoud have been in the manual
2,Enjoyable!,"I liked this novel quite a bit. It was a satisfying substitute while I wait for the next Maeve Binchy book!It is similar to Binchy's expanisve style with many characters and storeylines. It centers around 3 Irish women who meet on holiday in Egyot and follows them home to share their families/ careers/ romances.It is one of those books that you can very easily lose yourself in! Lots of fun, if somewhat predictable."
2,HAPPY with purchase,Thanks very much for the item. i bought it for my wife as a gift for returning from a vacation from US; and she loved it.
2,inexpensive with a really nice sound,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on whatever new guitar I purchased because I was planning on using it for alternate tunings, however after receiving the S34C and doing a little fiddling with it, I was surprised how good it sounded and played. I decided to use my other guitar for the alternate tunings for now. I slotted the bridge to lower the strings into the bridge and made a new bone saddle to replace the plastic one that came with the guitar. This guitar is laminate top to bottom, but really has a nice sound. For under a $100 you can't beat it."
2,Long After Dark,"'Long After Dark' is an often overlooked album by Tom Petty and yet it has some particularly good tracks on it. The steady keyboard beat of 'You Got Lucky' drives the song along and it has some of the best Petty lyrics of this era. 'Straight Into Darkness' is one of my Petty favourites and sits perfectly in the middle of this album. This album doesn't have the blatant rock n roll fun of his first album, the fire and power of 'Damn The Torpedoes' or the exuberance of 'Full Moon fever', yet it has a solid sound and feel to it that makes it stand out in it's own right. Not my first Petty choice or recommendation, but a great album never the less.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,One Series Too Many,"""The Skeleton in the Closet"" introduces new characters by M.C. Beaton, who is ""taking a break from her two long-running series."" I love Hamish, I love Agatha. But I do NOT love Fell and Maggie. They are dull and uninteresting. This series is one too many, and Ms. Beaton is stretching her creative powers too thin.I did not care about the characters, the plot was negligible, the setting never came to life. I read half of this book, then skipped stratight to the end, which was so predictable. Please, Ms. Beaton, use your wonderful creativity on Hamish and Agatha, and lay this series to rest!"
1,Too much of a lightweight read,"Admittedly, there aren't many books devoted to the LA river so we have to make do with what's available. Unfortunately, if you're looking for an in-depth historical biography, this certainly isn't it. Entertaining, maybe -- a big maybe. The text is so lightweight and airy, I half expected it to drift away. The Blake Gumprecht book is more thoroughly researched and thought out, and a much better choice."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I loved ""Altered Carbon"" (I constantly suggest it to friends) and thought ""Broken Angels"" was OK (not as good as the first but a decent sophomore effort, stupid twist at the end aside), but this was just a big disappointment. Heavy-handed social commentary masquerading as 3rd-rate science fiction - I should, perhaps, know better than to buy fiction that has a 'suggested reading' post-script, much less one that features Chomsky and Michael Moore. The cutesy bit where the protagonist ends up reading Morgan's first book really pushed me over the edge.Avoid this if you liked ""Altered Carbon"" and pray Morgan can re-find his groove."
2,Fairly Odd Parents,"This movie is awesome! Although The Fairly Odd Parents is a children's show, it has plenty of adult humour (think Ren and Stimpy or Spongebob). My friend and I started watching this and laughed for an hour and a half straight. Timmy and his godparents visit spoofs of TV shows such as SpeedRacer, The Simpsons, Batman, and Charlie Brown's Christmas Special. A definite must have for ANY age!"
2,masterful yet telling...,"I am in no state to review this film exactly, except to say that the subtle protrayal (can genocide be subtle) was all that we, I, the viewer could take. It is sad that more than ten years later, we still will only sit still to hear the tale of those with a happy ending. The stories of those whose bodies were driven over will perhaps never be heard. Worse yet, if those lives somehow found words, our ears, stopped soundly with the pulsing propaganda that peppers our dinners would not hear.I tremble for the day that the signal may be called for my children. God help us if the world chews its steak and swallows its words all while slowly turning its back.God help us all."
2,Handy & Sturdy,"I was surprised at how sturdy this was for the price. I have 3: one for mugs, and 2 in my pantry for various sundry. Love! Exactly what I was looking for."
1,It won't work for me either!,I can't get it to work either. I spent several days working with tech support but it just won't let me sign in to any site.
1,Defective-Wouldn't charge an 18volt battery.,I was throughly unhappy with this purchase. I would not recommend this charger. It would only charge up to 9.6 volts then stop. I have an 18 volt Black & Decker batteries. I found this unit completely useless.
2,Esteban's Guitar CourseEsteban is the best,Estebanis the best. I have many other video guitar courses but this is the best course ou there on the market. You will learn to play the guitar.
2,Harry Potter: Diagon Alley; Board Game,"At the begining of this game, you don't get how to play ,but once you play it and get the hang of it you find out thet it is quite a lot of fun! I definetly recomend this game to people that want a really fun game."
2,i like it,in crash dummies play slick to rescues dr.zub from junkman after torso.9000 one dummie stay and watch the lab.
2,George Lucas wasn't planning this prequel all along!,"In A Time Magazaine article dated March 6, 1978 on page 82 he discussed his plans for more than ten SEQUELS. No prequels! And originally the '77 relaesed star Wars film was not to be Star Wars 4: A New Hope. The Empire Strikes Back was supposed to be Star Wars 2!"
1,Now I know why this book wasn't reviewed by Booklist,"How sad that someone would go to all this effort to puttogether something that is basically useless. The print on the mapsis too small to read. All but 20 of the 278 pages of maps are in black and white. I thought I'd be getting something that my grandchildren could use as they were coming up through the years. There is always something about having a map that intrigues all of us, and adds a little bit more to our imaginations. When I was a junior high school librarian, I had several books of literary maps. Unfortunately, I don't remember their names. The students just loved them. Save your money on this one."
1,"Some Good Advice, But Forgettable...","This book contained some good advice for the beginning hypnotherapist, but, in contrast to other reviews, I would hardly call it indispensable. On the whole, the author and I simply approach our practices too differently for me to say I like his stuff... which reads as numbered must-do list... which, in turn, becomes incredibly tiresome. By the way, the ""good advice"" I referred to earlier, just so we're clear, is small and practical and usually not necessarily altogether hypnotherapy-related; for instance, for those who haven't been there before, keeping a small blanket in your office is good advice, not only for those occasions when a client may feel cold, but also for those occasions when a client wears too short of a skirt..."
2,Nice washcloth,"I got this for a washcloth, so it would stay on my hand, while I try to wash my busy little guy in the tub. It works well for that, the mini duck is cute, too.We will probably have more fun role playing with the puppets once he is a little older."
1,Doesn't last as advertised,I have a Canon S2 and these batteries last almost as long as the cheap costco non-rechargable ones. They do take upto 8 hours to charge and Amazon is correct about that. Does anyone know of good long lasting 2500 Mah rechargable batteries??
1,Does not work.,I bought this product to transfer files from a specific computer. It does not work. This computer has Windows XP operating system and the DataTraveler works on all other computers/laptops but the one that I bought it for. The driver won't install. I called technical support and they told me I should just return the product.
1,Doesn't Work,I had this wireless lapel clip on for a while. It doesn't catch vocals as expected. Therefore why should it work as a microphone & camcorder set? I am not very convinced. Getting this is a waste of money. :-(
2,She was more then country.,"I'm biased. I knew Patsy and booked her when I was a DJ. Patsy(real name Virginia) was one of the finest female singers country music ever had but I knew something most fans didn't This woman could belt the hell out of a jazz or blues tune. She was more then just a country singer. She was one of the best singers period. Some of that shows in this CD. Her version of Bill Bailey Won't You Please Come Home is one of the best ever recorded. She grabs this tune and gives meaning to every word, starting off slow and then swinging it to a fast finish...jazz at its best all the way. This cut alone is worth the price of the CD which is 95% country It's been 48 years since she died and she is still selling records AT A TIME WHEN MANY OTHER PERFORMERS ARE HERE TODAY AND GONE TOMORROW."
1,didn't receive it,still waiting. correspondence with co. was good but no results why must I write more words??????? I said what I wanted to say......la la la la la la
1,A good record book for the first year.,"For my first son I found such a complete book that records memories until age seven, that I wanted the same for my second baby. However, since it has been impossible to locate, I found this book which I think is O.K. No doubt is more complete than many I have found in my search, but I think its title is misleading since it says ""A record of your early years"" and it actually covers only the first year. Also, I think there are sections completely unrelevant (for instance too much on the grandparents instead of information to complete about the new baby). If you are the kind of person who would like to record in detail the physical and social development of your child, this is not the book to buy. If you are looking for a book with very nice illustrations for the first year, then it is o.k."
2,Replacement solder tips,This tip worked fine with my Weller soldering iron. It came pre-tinned and is held in magnetically - I'll be more careful to not lose this tip. My iron is back operating as good as new.
1,No chapters!,"Can't complain much since it's just .99, but having no chapters or table of contents makes this book hard to navigate."
2,Happy with product,I am happy with this cable. It appears to be well made and looks great. Seems to work flawlessly.
1,"It is nothing like the ""Purpose Driven"" which is awesome; this book is kinda vague..sorry","I guess I love the tapes so much that I thought this book was going to be like THE PURPOSE DRIVE; our reasons for being here. I just love those tapes..I really cannot figure out what the author wants me to know in this book. It is different from his other writings; in that, his message is not clear.""Yes,"" I understand the purpose of the church, but what does the author want me to know about its purpose.If the purpose is ""fellowship"" what type? He mentions discipleship, make it plainer please. His message wants me to think about a ""healthy"" church; in what way??? I mean how can people build a church without their donations, and attendance, etc. That's all they know. And Rick Warren does not tell me how to replace this with something specific."
1,shoddy scanning job,"I wasn't a happy camper. The book looks like it was scanned, and there are *lots* of scanner-produced typos. It doesn't have the publisher/translator etc. info that you need for scholarly use. And since *only* a scholar would want to use *this* book, it's not satisfactory at all."
2,Some of LaVey's Most Interesting Work,"Of all of LaVey's work, though the Satanic Bible is most well known, and arguably the best, this was the one I enjoyed the most. I think that the essays contained in The Devil's Notebook reveal a lot more about LaVey and about Satanism than you can find in any of his other works. This is one of the few books I have found recently that made a noticeable impact in my life."
2,More and Funnier Stuff Yet.,This is Lewis Black at his outragous best. I didn't think he could do better than his last album. I WAS WRONG!!
1,poor ea,ea are smoking something chronic if they didnt see any kind of reaction to this game. you should be able to give this game a zero star rating for its useless ness.
2,A good summary of Hitler's war against the Jews,"This is definitely a must read for any student of the Holocaust. Gilbert, however, fails to focus on the numerous other victims, such as Poles and Soviet POWs. In other words, he does not attempt to analyze the Holocaust from every angle. In order to understand the evolution of the Holocaust, one must be aware of the euthanasia program under Hitler and other oppressive measures against criminals, communists, asocials, and other ""undesirables"" which were practiced under the Third Reich long before the extermination of the Jews began."
2,"Next ""Game of the Year"".","I don't have anything bad to say about this game. The action, graphics, Geo Mod, etc, are all excellent and get 5 out of 5 from me. The AI is good to excellent; I would say between 4-5. The only thing I would say is that the monsters should have had better AI. Weapons are awesome. Using submarines, trucks and the hover crafts is cool. The Geo Mod makes the multiplayer mode a lot of fun. ANYBODY WHO LIKED HALFLIFE WILL LOVE THIS GAME. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes first person shooters."
1,Somehow it didn't work?,I think I purchased a bootleg from the seller? The speed wasn't correct for either the audio and video. I threw it in the trash.
1,Incredibly bad product and service,"The kit was supposed to be complete except for batteries. It arrived without: memory card (so would not function even if it worked), serial cable, wrist strap, camera case, quickstart guide, users guide. The camera will not even power up on batteries (does using an AC adapter). SO NO VALUE at all. Obviously this kit had ZERO inspection. NO REPLY TO EMAILS. this is the worst experience that I have had buying from an online vendor."
2,"Not just for sports fans, but for LIFE fans","My brother told me about this book (since he's a life-long subscriber of SI), and I then got it for my boyfriend. I couldn't resist reading Barkley's introduction before gift-wrapping it, and then I ended up reading the whole thing.I'd only read a few of Reilly's columns before & had always enjoyed them. This book presents the best of the best in the perfect package. Some were laugh-out-loud funny with Reilly's sardonic wit, while others definitely put me in a pensive mood for the next few hours.The way Reilly writes his columns shows that these stories are about life and that sports are the secondary factor. This book makes the perfect non-maintstream book gift. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't relate to or get something out of Reilly's columns."
2,Mind blowing story,"Read this story to get into the skin of somebody who woke up one day all transformed. A modern Metamorphosis but in real life. It's a sobering tale which can inspire you if it does not depress you. Read it if you are already strong in yourself and you don't need a pep talk which it's not. I initially purchased it to get motivated and it brought me down. However, it deals with reality and ultimately reality is what will bring anybody up. As we accept life as it comes to us, we are able to cope with it and make sure our positives are more than the negatives in life. To that extent the book does exactly that. My hat off to such a brave soul who chose to struggle to the very end. Writing a book with your left eye lid is proof that the human spirit lives on."
1,The Uncut 192 Minute Original Cinerama Release Version,"I see this is being released once again on Blu-Ray on February 7th, 2012 and don't know why...this states that this is the same time length as the original Blu-Ray release. We need to see the original, uncut Cinerama release version of 3 hours and 12 minutes finally to arrive for its 50th anniversary in 2013 and also incorporating the original poster artwork that was used in the MGM/UA double video cassette release."
2,A Book to Savor,"Robinson has given us a marvelous, engrosing, make-you-think book -- my favorite kind. Highly recomended."
1,Nice Try...Move On,"Please don't waste your money. This CD, though an admirable effort by a vocally talented artist, is one of the worst attempts at a breakout album ever recorded. The simple lyrics and dated, electronic sound might pull some weight overseas, but the good ol' U.S. of A. will not embrace mediocre writing spliced with poorly synthesized accompaniment. ""Just close your eyes and count to two/dive on in just me and you""??? Who counts to TWO? Why not ""Just close your eyes and count to three/dive on in just you and me""? And who can overlook the cheesy phone conversation played at the beginning of one of the songs? Come on, Mr. Thomas, we know you can sing. Now prove that you can write."
2,Fear the Living,Life is short...do not test Rick. Do not throw zombies at him. You want to see how the Living treat each other in a zombie world...check it out.If not...go watch the English Patient or some boring movie.
2,New version is great,"This is a more sturdy version than the previous version. Adding words is great. And it doesn't mean that you have to read the words when going through this book. We have all adlibbed, haven't we? It can be just a search book or a read to them book. Use it any way you want. It's great. It's bright, colorful, and holds up to baby's use. There are so many things to talk in this book. A great feature for special needs children is the duck on each page for them to find. Small steps learning."
1,Dependability,"This item failed after eight months of minimal use. This DC power supply was used very lightly and not abused (as in dropping, etc.)."
1,"Newt? You're kidding, right?","All I need do to rate this book (I didn't say I didn't open it) is to read that Newt considers one of the prime problems with America is the lack of GOD.When Newt owns up to his own shallowness and lack of integrity, then I might be able to listen to him preach about God. Then again, maybe not.Newt displayed his own sense of Godliness, righteousness and holiness when he walked out on his cancer-stricken wife. What a guy! I mean it. But would I spend 50 cents on a book he wrote?Probably not."
1,After 1 year...,"Nice attractive design. Can hear people good on it. my only complaint would be that it gets staticky two rooms away from the system. Otherwise, the battery holds charge well. No other complaintsUPDATE: well, having this over a year now. I will say it's junk. The battery doesn't hold up and the add'l phone some reason won't charge. I have also switched phones. Dont know what else to tell you. Stick to Panasonic !!"
1,No,"I will buy anything even remotely similar to this band. I will praise even sub-par releases from this band such as Love Beach and In The Hot Seat. I will defend this band to my last breath knowing they have been bashed and maligned relentlessly by the music press and so called ""rock critics"". I have seen this band perform live so many times I have lost count. But I will never understand the logic behind this release."
2,Favourite cartoon classics... great !,That's a great VHS. It's a great reminder for some cartoons. I like it !
1,NOT RODIN,This sculpture is NOT an exact replica of Rodin's Thinker and should not be advertised as such. It is only similar. The face and posture are quite different from the original.
2,Sweet,"I really enjoy this authors books, this book was very well written and interesting to read. I look forward to reading more."
1,Totally disappointed and false advertising,They kept me waiting all this time saying the that they were out of stock and now they cancelled my order. It was false advertising and I would never buy from them again.
2,Hats off to Romanesca,"If I can only take one Baroque recording to a deserted island, this would be it. My favorite track in this 2-CD set is track 2 on CD#1. I must have played this track hundreds of times in my car during the past year and a half. I have never gotten tired of listening to it and doubt I ever will. I have another recording (a 1994 recording with violinist Marianne Ronez of Switzerland) of these Biber sonatas from Cavalli Records and it sounds no where as impressive as Romanesca's."
1,Not very useful!,"This book really isn't very useful, especially for anyone living outside the southwestern desert. Mr. Olsen wrote the outdoor survival merit badge requirements for the boy scouts, and this is indicative of how the book reads. Most of the information is nice to know and even interesting at times, but it gets silly at points and is more historical in nature than anything. This book might be a good read for those interested in how people survived off the land in the distant past, but offers nothing in terms of modern survival skills. I believe that anyone interested in actually surviving in the wilderness would be better off looking elsewhere. I was disappointed."
2,Great can opener,"Both the service and product are 5 stars! The ease of ordering, delivery, and product quality make me wonder why I ever hop into my car to drive to a store to buy things."
1,Not what I expected.,These just don't hold up. Too big and too weak. My flower boxes (under the max weight) caused them to bend.
1,Don't do it.,"I am giving this bike 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow anything less. If you are thinking about buying this bike, you would be better off going to a bike shop and spending 50 dollars more. The bike shops 250 dollar bike will be lighter weight, have better parts, and most of all will be more reliable. In the long run you will save money too. I guarantee that you will spend more on repairs of this bike than the initial cost at purchase. And, if you take a look at any of the other bikes on this site, well then remember this review; as it is true across the board."
1,Good for beginners,"This a a great book for beginners - Absolute Beginners who know nothing about saving, investing or finance. I found the book very shallow; they touch on everything but just skim the surface and say very little of substance. I'm by no means an expert, but this book bored me and was a waste of my time (but not money - I checked it out of the library)"
2,Felt like I was in Spain!,"Although I was familiar with only 1 of the songs on this CD, all the songs are now my favorites!Easy to listen to. I'm so glad that I bought it!"
2,amazing,"all of impaled is fire this album is fire as well if you are a fan of carcass, exhumed, or ghoul this is crucial and you must own it"
2,Works well with hand held heart doppler for home!,This gel works well with the doppler fetal heart monitors for at home use. This gel does not leave a mess and wipes away when you are finished. There is plenty in this bottle to use through multiple pregnancies.
2,Unique and helpful addition to other instruction,"The introduction part does come across like an ad, but once it gets going there is a lot of useful stuff. Instruction is interspersed with pieces of interviews with students of Melissa's, which is not instruction per se. But I think the interviews are very helpful in showing how it's put to use, as well as demonstrating the importance of vocal health. Most of the concepts Melissa reviews are things you'll encounter with a more traditional singing instructor, but she has her own way of describing them and explaining how they relate to screaming. She also has some unique exercises, tailored to heavy vocalizing. I think this DVD is most beneficial in conjunction with lessons/other instruction.The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it only scratches the surface, and it's only designed to scratch the surface. I think this is fine for what it is, but it isn't everything. That, and the first 20 minutes are self-indulgent."
1,The Rule Of Four,"The first rule for the rule of 4 is to not buy this book. I was enticed by the notion that this might be a DaVinci Code equal. I was 100 pages into the book and was still not sure what all the nonsense was about. I guess the second rule is - beware of dual authors. I slipped this time, not again!"
2,Well Made and Good Message,I just watched Sarah's Choice on 1/11/10. It is well made and has quality actors. The storyline is based on a single career woman named Sarah who becomes pregnant unexpectant. She faces a decision of what to do with the child and the direction of her life. I have TV Guardian and it even did not have anything to cut out. This would be a good family film and is pro-life. God reveals Himself to her in a series of three dreams before she makes her decision about the child and her future. Great story on God's forgiveness and human forgiveness!
2,Does what it's supposed to do,I lost the data cable that came with my Fusic and had ended up buying a Mobile Action package from RadioShack.. Bad mistake.. Their cable limited what you could do through the USB port and had bad drivers.I found this cable on Amazon. Lo and behold it functions exactly the same way the original cable I had lost does. I should have just bought this one from the get go.
1,nervous because of news of fakes,"I've bought this before at an Ulta and was excited that it was cheaper here. although the product smells correct and has a similar texture, it doesn't quite seem to be the color I remember. when I opened the package it seemed like perhaps the product had been opened, as the lid had product in the grooves despite the inside ""seal"" that comes with the product. I will betaking this home with me this weekend to compare it to the real thing-- until then it WILL NOT touch my hair.I simply don't trust it yet. I'll try to figure out how to update this review when I compare the two."
1,Not Feelin This,I bought this because Bizzy is my favorite rapper. But I didn't enjoy one track from this.
1,Same old boring high heat,Terrible graphics. Weak framerate. Buggy. Boring gameplay. All adds up to do not purchase.
2,Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone,Great reading for all ages children and adults the book is better than the movie in my opinion. Read on
1,Not in French!!!,"The comic book was in ok condition, but I wanted the French language version but got the English version instead!!Could not even return it as I took all the books as gifts to India...very disappointing!"
1,A Self-Righteouse Snooze Fest,"I began reading ""A Little Love Story..."" (and little is what you get) believing the protagonist, Jake, to be around 60 with those dorky opinions of his. When I learned he was only 30, I was completely turned off to Jake and the story, an unrealistic, sappy tale with an ""I'm holier-than-thou"" vibe that is numbing. It only got worse from there.Dull and cliched, the plot plods along, but although it's a sad story, you can't get anything up for it except for a snicker here or there. There's nothing worse than obviousness and false sentimentality in writing. The worst of it is that the author continuously interjects his trite opinions about the world, such as this gem, ""I don't like aggressive people."" Ugh.What really put the kabbash on it for me was the whole 9/11 tired subplot with the ex-girlfriend. I mean, geez, that's as low as you can get in tugging at the heartstrings.As a female, I say this with pleasure. I'd rather read Charles Butkowski any day!"
2,Great alternative to regular pasta shells,Great tasting and slightly different to the palate than regular grain pasta. Cook longer than recommended for tender Quinoa.
2,no manual at all!!!,"We received this as a gift for Christmas, but there was no manual included!!! It also happened to the three other families who received this same gift. Not sure where the problem originated, but I pulled out the warranty card, found the 1-800 number to the company, called them and they graciously apologized and are sending me a manual by mail. Good results from company for damage control on that error."
1,was sent wrong item,The filters I ordered were for a Ryobi cordless hand held vac. What arrived were filters for a Vista cordless hand held vac
2,Hip Hop,"This is my 3rd MF Doom album. They all sound completely different. This album is another true Hip Hop collection. Viktor avoids choruses that plague today's rap scene. The beats are crazy. Some of the songs have beats that switch up in the middle of the song. The scratching on a few of these tracks had me flipping out! Yet again MF Doom, pushes the bounderies on this album. My favorite track is the one feat Kool Keith."
1,Save your money!,"My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
2,upside down plug or display?,"We have this outlet attached to a heater to keep one room warm while the rest of the house gets cold at night. The heater has a thermostat knob, which is worthless, and why we like this outlet. It holds the temperature where we set it. However, the display is upside down. The outlets in my house have the ground wire hole on top. I had an electrician and a fireman tell me this is the correct orientation. The reasoning is that if something falls and strikes the plug, it hits the ground wire first, reducing the risk of an electrical hazard. So, my thermostat outlet works fine, but we have to stand on our heads to program it."
1,Aburrido y pedagógico,"Este libro intenta narrar la supuesta historia de un chino que viene a Occidente, pero este ""choque"" entre dos culturas (en vez de tener la fluidez de otras novelas sobre el Lejano Oriente como ""Memorias de una geisha"" o ""La esposa del dios del fuego""), se convierte aqui en una historia aburridisima y torpemente contada. Es evidente que la autora buscó información en diversas fuentes, pero no tiene el vuelo literario para convertir esos datos en una historia interesante. Es el tipo de autor que pretende hacer una novela ""historica"", copiando lo que dicen libros de textos, pero nunca logra integrar la información de las fuentes con la ficcion. Peor que esa información impostada es la trama aburrida y sin vuelo alguno. Tuve que hacer un esfuerzo enorme para llegar al final. Mi esposa dejó el libro en la página 23. Consejo: No pierda su tiempo. Busquese otro libro."
2,Little League - too much pressure on the Kids,"This is an excellent book on the inner happenings of Little League Baseball. I really enjoyed the candid assesments of how parents and managers go overboard. The book though is not a bashing of the little league faults - it gives inside looks at what happens at williamsport and the teams...I really enjoyed the stories about the ugly rivalry between California and Florida and how Dante Bichette Sr. got out of control - also the stories about Curacao and Japan and how serious they take the game - the stories about the pitcher's not resting their arms and getting major injuries is a wake up...Finally, the story centers on Hawaii and how they built their team swithcing from Pony to Little League - and how they practiced so hard - 6 days a week! Great stories about Little league baseball and how Travel teams are so much better and talented (cooperstown baseball)...if you enjoy youth baseball - you'll love this book"
1,So so so misleading,"Im really not into giving movies bad reviews, for everybody has their own vantage point. Although i will say dead clowns is very misleading. Dont get me wrong, i love indy films. I had been trying to get my hands on a copy of dead clowns because the cover is emaculate. Anything that looks that good on the cover, has to be good right? WRONG. WTF i dont understand i dont think i even saw a fkn clown untill halfway through the movie. No dialouge, very little plot, which my thirteen year old sister could have imagined. I actually bought this copy from amazon. I should have listened to the other reveiewers, when i read this was unbearable. Being stubborned like i am, i just had to find out for myself. I wont tell anyone else not to see this movie, because like i said before everybody has a diffrent vantage point. Ill just tell you to proceed with caution."
2,Great item!,I didnt want to spend the $18.00 on theese strips because I doubted them.. Luckily I had a coupon from Michaels it was 50% off one item so I bought the 4 pack. The strips worked well . My cakes come out perfect I also use them when I make cheesecakes it is easier than the waterbath method!
2,Great cable to bring out the best in your Wii!,I bought this cable after reading the reviews from Amazon. I am very happy with the purchase and I did see a lot of improvement in the image quality. I cannot compare it with other cables but this one is definitely a good buy.
2,Good Entertainment - Book & DVD,"Take the book for what it should be considered, entertainment. It is loosely based on the CIA and the Cold War and has some truth to events and characters. I don't think this was to meant as a history book. Good entertainment and read the book before you watch the DVD(HBO) as it will help you understand the movie."
1,Uninspired karaoke?,"I am a fan of Vesta's, and I own a few of her other cds. So I expected more: particularly, some creative interpretation of the songs performed as only Vesta can. The selection of songs is great, but they are recorded with virtually no changes except for Vesta replacing the original vocalists. I'd recommend that you wait and buy this used. Relationships is a far stronger cd. I also recommend Christian McBride's Family Affair, as Vesta puts in a strong performance on ""Or So You Thought."""
1,this sucked,boring and annoying :( bummer because I love Ben A. Do not rent this movie. It is a Christmas waste of time.
1,Only a Hell House if your fear is dying of boredom,"I don't read much horror fiction, so I was expecting this book to be interesting, with a lot of suspense and gore, but it was so boring I would have returned it if I could (I bought the Kindle version). The most interesting bits were in the last 10%, like, the last 5 pages. The rest read more like a little kid's idea of ""scary"" pornography. Seriously. ""Oh my god, maybe she's a lusty lesbian in denial!"" Oooo, scary. Which, I must say - if you are disturbed by sexual violence, this book might likely bother you.It seemed like he meant it to have a psychological ""fear of the true self"" element but it was soooo shallow it was truly comical. And there's more interesting attempts at scientific phenomena in Pullman's His Dark Materials. MAYBE if I believed in ghosts I would have been more entertained, but I seriously doubt it. It maybe would work better as a graphic novel. A total yawn."
1,Doesn't Play,Looks to be scratched and does not play on XBOX or computer. I'm sure the content is great but we can't see it.
1,Leaving Las Vegas (Movie),"The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points. The wrong movie was delivered. I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas. And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas. So that was bad."
1,can't get into it,"i won't hate on this record. i just don't get it. bejar's work with the new pornographers led me here, but try as i may, i can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. it's as if i've heard all these songs before. maybe for you, definitely not for me!"
2,Our family's fav vitamin,"I've been buying/taking this vitamin for the whole family for many years. I'm happy w/ the results and feel good about it. But be aware that if you don't want iron, you have to choose ""No Iron"" formula, or else it will have iron. We also just take one a day, not the 3 that is suggested cuz we eat really healthy/varieties. This is a very good choice for your daily multi."
2,Luau Party Time - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,This karaoke CDG contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. My Little Grass Shack - (Traditional)2. The Hukilau Song - (Don Ho)3. Blue Hawaii - (Elvis Presley)4. Aloha 'Oe - (Tradtional)5. Tiny Bubbles - (Don Ho)6. Sweet Leilani - (Traditional)7. Lovely Hula Hands - (Alfred Apaka)8. Hawaiian Wedding Song - (Elvis Presley)
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work","These bowls would be great if they worked. We've had these bowls for 2 years and they never stick to a tray for more than a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Just when I let my guard down they'd come loose and were easy for a little one to fling across the room. With regular bowls parents wouldn't expect them to stick in the first place and would be more prepared. (The lids on these bowls are very difficult to snap and unsnap, so I'd recommend another set of bowls entirely.)"
2,"Exciting ""Knights"" of reading await the fantasy loving reader","After the first few chapters of ""The Orphaned Knight"", I was anxiously anticipating the final encounter but was in no rush to get there. The short chapters that cram in first love, dragons, fights to the death and incredible evildoers make for easy and exciting reading. There was just enough blood and gore to satisfy my savage side but unlikely to frighten my grandchildren who I'm sure will enjoy it as much, if not more than I did.Eric Varma has written an outstanding first novel and I'm waiting to find out what will happen next to the Orphaned Knight"" and his faithul friend and wolf, Shadow."
2,C'esr Magnifique,I saw this film in french at school it was great our teacher got it from France. Hope you like it to
2,This started it all!,"JD Robb (Nora Roberts), I was so happy when I found these and have been reading everything I can get my hands on."
2,Good book - I just wish the underlying software was better,"The book does a good job explaining how to use Camera Raw. That said, most of what it covers, you can pick up on your own once you learn how to run Camera Raw for the first time (much like HDR, Photoshop does a great job of hiding it). If you are a pro or very serious about your photography, you will find suggestions on how to calibrate and speed up your workflow.All that said, I find PS + Camera Raw slow and underpowered even compared to Canon's own Digital Photo Pro that comes bundled with each SLR. No wonder Adobe developed Lightroom as a separate product.Last but not least, do not order this book used from indie sellers with cheap shipping -- it took almost a month to deliver mine from East to West coast!!! I wish I had bought it slightly more expensive from Amazon directly and saved time."
1,Originals please,"I agree with the sentiments here. George, the ORIGINALS WITH 5.1 surround sound mixes. STOP being such a cry baby about how much you hate the originals and realize your FANS are the ones who LOVE them so much.After all, without the FANS, you'd just have had another THX1138 on your hands as far as popularity goes...1 star only until you correct your error of a lifetime."
2,Good Fun Game.,"This game is great it's sort of challenging at the start whenyou have to collect pieces of the solar surfer but I found out asecret:AT THE START SCREEN,SELECT CONTINUE AND WHEN IT ASKS FORA PASSWORD,TYPE APRON TO SKIP TO CRESENTIA SPACEPORT."
1,this CD sucks (...),"Cani's new album was unexpectedly wack... no disrespect to bis... i mean i've stood by him since da beginning and i'm still standin by him, but this album was da wackest (...) i've eva heard. i aint feelin da whole ""stan"" theme he got in his album, its lame..."
1,broken cd case,"My cd showed up with a shattered case. Wasnt worth sending it back to correct it, was supposed to be a gift"
1,I just didn't think that it presented anything new...,"This book really left me wanting something more, from the book that is. It was well written, but the material was just the same old advice I've been hearing from my friends and family for years. Also, I don't feel that the book does a good job of addressing the dating scence outside of major metro areas where I think that dating is more difficult."
1,Didn't last more than 2 months!,Would not recommend this light for the money. Did not last. Bought this because liked the fact it had lighter charger. Unfortunately it died quick and didn't even get to use it much.
2,Great Tool!,"This is an excelent tool for anyone who is studying the scriptures (bible) from beginners to those who are looking for a deeper understanding of the scriptures or just need to look something up (it is a concordance). Strong's has a number system that has been used for over a century and no wonder why! It is very efficient and especialy useful for those studying hebrew/greek, exegesis, etc. I highly recommend this product for any serious scriptures student! I also recommend [[ASIN:0785245677 Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary Of Old And New Testament Words Limited, Deluxe Edition](These two work well together)"
2,Absolute classic,"I don't know too much about Chinese History, literature nor translation.I just believe that this is a fantastic read for anyone who is pursuing a career in health or is just interested in their health. The book is like being privy to ""secret"" healing knowledge believed to be written by a king! Its absolutely fascinating to see how interconnected our world is with health. That our bodies do this and that in summer and this and that in winter, we are stronger at this time and weaker at this time. All of the rhythms and things that we take for granted all seem to have an effect on us in one way or another.Often times this ""ancient knowledge"" does become proved through studies and just through individuals health and well being."
2,Perfect for my purpose,"I fish plastics 95% of the time but I do fish spinnerbaits occasionally and needed a small box to fit a small pocket on my tackle bag and hold a few spinnerbaits. I've been using a box without dividers, better than nothing but really a pain because everything stays tangled up. This little box neatly holds 6 long arm spinnerbaits as advertised. It is what it is ...... a little plastic box ..... but the construction seems adequate and it latches securely."
1,An absolute piece of junk. Don't WASTE your money!!!!,"This has got to be the worst chain I have ever purchased. Wal-mart sells more durable chains than this. Shimano should be ashamed of themsleves. I'd never put this on any bike, even if it was gifted to me.First time, it worked for about 25 miles and broke. Second time, worked for about 50 miles and then broke. I decided not to put it back on my bike. Grabbed an ""emergency"" chain off an old wal-mart bike and have been riding without any problems since. Considering the bike came out of the trash.... well, you get my point.Don't think that your going to get away with a good HG53 chain. This chain is nothing but junk. Don't waste your time or money on this. Steer away. Don't make me tell you that ""I told you so"". If you want a entry level chain, go to wal-mart and buy the ""bell"" brand for around $8, it will last much longer!!!If you want quality then you must go ultegra, dura ace, xtr, or Sram."
2,Answering Question Below,"Dude, this is a 2-CD Set. The first CD has same tracks as original On the 6 CD and the second CD has the 5 bonus tracks. They're really hot, energy-filled songs that are perfect for parties."
2,"P.D.James best to date,Resented time away from this.","Well developed characters. Few Red herrings, Paints excellent picture both of Scotland Yard's methods and English legal system. If film rights purchased Glenn Close would find dream role as Venetia."
2,Perfect gift for any young boy !!!,"My sister got this book for my 7 yr old son for his birthday. Once he opened it he could have cared less that there were more presants to open. We were all amazed by the quality and intricate details of the pop-ups. My 3 year old was even enamored by it. While the descriptions seemed to me to be over his head, he understood them after looking at the pop-ups. It is his favorite book and he has to read it every night before he goes to bed, and then puts it back up high on a shelf for ""safe keeping"".When did pop-ups get sooooo good???"
1,"Good quality, poor customer service","The book is in excellent condition. It is of no use to me however. I did not recieve the book until almost a month after I ordered it. I had to use it for one of my classes,and I could not wait any longer for it to arrive, so had to go to the school bookstore and buy another copy of the book. When the copy i bought from the Amazon merchant arrived, I tried to return it, but I could not find a return address anywhere. I sent the merchant an e'mail asking for a return address four days ago, but I have still not recieved an address. I am very disappointed by this lack of customer service, and because I will probably not be able to get a refund now, since it has been more than thirty days since I ordered the book."
2,AWESOME!!,"This book has all the key components that make a strong, lasting relationship! This book shows step by step how to give your partner a lifetime of unconditional love as well as receiving unconditional love in return."
2,Great Album,Love this album. We are friends of Eric Stone and love his music. If you like Trop Rock than you'll love Eric Stone.
1,Pure Crap,"One of the most cheesy books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I had to force myself to keep reading, thinking it couldn't get any worse. You are told that if you follow her advice, you too will get 3 job offers in a week and a date! Wow, if only life were this easy. She also seems proud of her Sister Goddesses in training who basically turn into what most women would label loose...I think what I disliked most were her examples of women in her class, I found them irritating and silly.If a man pulled this crap, he would be accused of manipulating women for his own gain."
1,no rating - really cheap chinese product,"i ordered 2 of these after having a similar kind but of a better quality made in Italy. Both did not have the spill proof valve that is usually on the other end of the shut-off clamp and the liquid just leaks. What in the world are they selling incomplete/mal-functioned products. I have not been able to use mine since I got it a few months back. So annoying and a waste of money.I will not even give this a 1 star, basically it is off the rating list."
1,Don't buy this book,The book you get is not the book shown. It is a paperback and it is the international edition. At lease the seller got the subject right. Stuck with the book due to classes have started last week.
2,A well-written coming-of-age story.,"This book is excellent reading for high schoolers. It exposes the reader to a culture that they probably no little about. More importantly, it is a story about teenagers and their struggles as they try to find their place in the world."
2,the best ramsey lewis album!,"i have 4 ramsey lewis' album and this is by far the best one i've heard... in this album ramsey uses the cello in some of the most emotionally involving tracks particularly Second Thoughts and Air From Suite #3... i first got wind of this album from a friend who loaded it in my ipod...after listening to the whole album a couple of times, i immediately bought the CD... i enjoy the music much more now because it's in WAV format instead of MP3, and i'm playing it on my hi-fi audio system!"
1,Finally gave up on this book,"I do not read fiction. History is my subject and I have read about Lincoln, Truman, LBJ, JFK, Jefferson, space exploration, the Civil War, incredible tales of survival and heroics, climbing Mt. Everest, etc. I can only recall one other book that I finally gave up on and now cannot remember which one it was. I had just read Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs and enjoyed it and Ben Franklin is waiting in the wings. I now have quit this book about half way through.My take is this: Either Issacson does not do a good job of explaining the theory of relativity (he does have an interest in it and it seems a pretty good knowledge of the theory) or I am just too thick. Now, I am certainly not the sharpest knife in the drawer but I did just retire from flying large jets to international destinations for the last 34 years. Also, as high powered, driven, intelligent people go, I just did not find Albert Einstein all that interesting."
1,A Travesty,"If you like the version of the song at the end of Donnie Darko, you will hate the dance remix on this CD. There is a video (crappy) for the version from the movie, and watching that with your eyes closed is the only pleasant thing to do with this CD single."
2,"Finnegans Wake: Not Just a Book, and Experience","I'm 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best book I've ever read. I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine. GET THIS BOOK NOW!"
2,"Good design, good value, very portable","First of all the description of the repair stand is incomplete in regard to the ""accessories""... there is either a small storage area for nuts and bolts OR a digital weight scale.I purchased the stand due to the overall design of the stand: tripod design, collapsible, travel/storage bag, clamp design. I worked at a bicycle shop for about 5 years and tried several different brands but I liked the topeak stand the most for the price (I tried a similarly designed stand but it was about $75 higher in price). This is also the often the stand of choice when our shop provided mechanical assistance at races/events."
1,"Good, But . . .","The good: great design, beautiful, keeps perfect timeThe bad: not water resistant--wore it swimming (no diving) and the crystal is fogged. Am afraid it's ""toast."" Hopefully Amazon or Wenger will replace it under the warranty."
1,Terrible Waste of Time.,"Christopher Baker is a pig and a narcissist. I wanted to read about Cuba instead of an aging loser riding around picking up girls and pontificating on how mighty he feels. Parts of this book read like a romance novel, other parts like a washed up rock-star's biography, and in between is a small bit of useful information about the country.Also, a less useless map would have been nice."
2,A wondrous journey to serenity,I have found amazing applications for Coxon's music. It is so emotive and powerful that it is able to quiet down a rowdy ship lounge filled with hundreds of people and completely alter the energy state of the audience. I am then able to present my lectures to a calm thoughful audience.The real test comes when I watch patients with panic an anxiety fall into merciful sleep during guided imagery using Coxon's music in the background. Get all four of his disks. They are a grand investment.
2,One of the most important books I've ever read,"Richard Weaver was one of the best philosopher/writers of this century. This book is far-reaching in scope and theme starting with his first section, The Heritage, which encompasses - The Feudal System, the Code of Chivalry, the Education of the Gentleman and the Older Religiousness - to describe how the world view of the old South came to be.He illuminates the Southern literary renaissance better than any of the poor attempts I've read by others.Using a vast amount of material, published and unpublished, he presents in a very well organized fashion the South's own portrait of itself, as accurately as it has ever been presented."
2,honost in a much bigger sence,"this motion picture fits in my definition of ""keepnig in mind a thought for the next morning"". it is simple in structure, selective in script and amazing regarding actors faces appearance. i have reconsidered ranking Spacey in my list of best actors by including him in a new list called ""best acting selectors""."
2,A true Inspiration,"This album was truly in inspiration. William belted his heart out in ""I Believe I can Fly"", and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". His voice was that of an angel sent from up above. Y.M.C.A had me dancing in my car on the way to work.....I have listened to William's album everyday from the day I bought it, and that was several weeks ago. William's unique and powerful has definently changed the music industry. If you do not own this album you should go out and buy it today. Go William!!!!"
2,Witchblade - worth the waiting,"Hello there,This week I got the long awaited Witchblade DVD-series at home. It was worth the waiting. What took you guys so long, from Warner Brothers? But he, I don't want to complain. Witchblade is worth seeing over and over again. The magic tale, the nice effects, the good acting and the good looking Yancy Butler as Sara Pezzini - the witchblade (carrier).Thanks Amazon for this product.And for the guys who still have an illegal copy - bought for too much money and poor quality: Buy the real thing, and eat your heart out!Greetings from Amsterdam, Dieter Mooijer"
2,sentimientos a flor de piel. simply the best.,"poseo todos sus cds, incluido el ultimo ""gente"", y aunque este no es su mejor disco (todos los artistas maduran musicalmente con cada nuevo trabajo), canciones como ""me das el mar"" y ""alma de blues"" irradian tal poesia y belleza que se te quedan grabadas en la cabeza y no puedes olvidarte de su letra y melodia. Por supuesto si buscas los tipicos ritmos calientes (salsa, merengue..) este disco no es para ti. FIRST CLASS ONLY.Todos los discos posteriores a este son simplemente obras maestras."
2,pacs best work,straight out perfect album every song is great there is about 7 classics on this awsome album
1,Do not even think of buying this piece ?hit!,"It won't work. All of my video players in my computer were crashed. The included stupid software did not even recognize its hardware. The ADS website does not have this produce information because it has been discontinued. There was no single line of description of this ?hit.That is why it was so cheap. I am totally disappointed by AMAZON. I never ever buy from AMAZON, because returning procedure sucks.I am going to hit this product with my hammer, and going to frys."
1,Not designed for the Flyfisher.,Very little information is inserted that is of benefit to the flyfisher. Classifications are outdated and most of the text is complicated and useless. Some of the pictures (drawings) were great. It helped in identifying some of the basic insects.
1,Madonna can do better than that,"I really love Madonna, but this CD is just nuts!!!!! I love her old songs, i bought this CD because it is old, its made in 1987. I thought it would be better, mabe 3 or 2 songs are good out of the hole cd. I would have happily picked 1 star, but i didn't because i love Madonna."
2,Exodus,"For my wife and I this was a return to the year when we were dating. This film was playing and we went to see it. She liked the soundtrack so much that I bought it for her as a gift. This was in 1961 or 1962. We enjoyed the movie then and enjoyed it more this time because of the memories. The fact that we are older and seem to understand a little more about the world also enhanced the experience. Buy it, you will like it."
2,Give My Regards to Broadway,"If you enjoy documentaries, you will enjoy this one, especially if you enjoy musicals. It was interesting to see how Broadway came about and how it started out as Vaudville type productions to what a Broadway show is today. Julie Andrews hosts the documentary and like she said ""Lets Start from the Very Beginning, A Very Good Place to Start"". Also a great companion to this collection is the audio compilation that is also available."
2,clean teeth,Be sure to select the proper refill for your specific automatic toothbrush. I got our correct replacement the first time with Amazon. Excellent product!
1,don't loose your money,The really expensive little book lacks coherence and it is difficult to follow due to the full of citations and data piled up and left as row material page after page.
2,As good as the original,A little bit pricey but you have the pay the price of your own lack of care....As good as the original.
2,disney movie,"It is a good quality movie, arrived fast and is what was expected. Love the movie and so do my children. Good time to buy while the price is down, before it goes into the vault."
1,"luckily, i didn't expect much.","I purchased two of these, one for my apartment and one as a gift for my brother-in-law. Mine lasted for about 6 months before it just stopped working mid-vacuum session. I think the problem with mine is overheating. It works for about 5 minutes then stops but i am able to start it up the next day but only for a couple of minutes. My bro-in-laws stopped working even before mine. We both have small apartments (mine with short office-like carpet and tile, his with hardwood floors and one large wool carpet)and neither of us have pets. I was hoping we would get at least a year out of the vacuum, but unfortunately, was let down. I will say that the suction and pick up, initially, is great and the vacuum cleans very very well. In the end, if you are looking to buy, spend the extra money and buy something more dependable."
1,BEWARE,"If I could, I wouldn't give a single star. Don't be a fool--this could be considered commercial cheating. In fact, the bonus CD has nothing to do with Diana Ross at all! And the person who wrote the liner notes was even intelligent enough not to sign. There's much better than this; this is going very low."
1,Sound Quality,"I have a very high end 2 channel stereo. This is a review of the sound quality only. From the prior reviews, many said this was the best sounding yet, with a 24-bit remastering. Well I A-B compared this with the same tracks off the 20-bit original recording remasters and they win without a doubt! Much better bass, mids and not as bright and hashy. For me, those are the best sounding Scorpions to date."
2,Amazing Spider-Man #539 : Back In Black (1st Print - Marvel Comics) [Comic],"Nice book, got it for my collection.Nice story, nice graphics, little short though, but I got the spider-Man:Black in Black HC that has over 300 pages and the ultimate collection with over 1000 pages so I have a lot to read."
2,Excellent Service,We had never bought from this retailer before and we got our camera right on time...excellent product as well!
2,Short story collection,"I believe it takes a special talent to be able to produce a good short story, particularly these days when there are not many publishing outlets for them. This collection then, is especially welcome since it brings together short stories from many famous authors. Like any collection, however, it contains stories that are good, and stories that are bad, and some that are a little of both. It's to the credit of the editor that he has produced this work, and I recommend it to those who enjoy reading shorter works from some of their favorite authors. Despite some of the shortcomings of this collection, I am looking forward to the next edition of this work, if only for the continuation of the last story in the collection."
1,Bad,"I'm not articulate enough to really explain what is wrong with this movie besides the acting. First of all, the Romans were the bad guys. Why is this film putting you on the side of the bad guys? And why does the Celtic slave suddenly change his mind and decide to help the Roman? It was a completely spontaneous moment that made no sense. And why IS it noble for a slave to have loyalty to his keeper against his own people. Just stupid.Also, let's be clear. The Picts were not Native Americans. The inappropriate co-opting of Native American imagery to dress up the Picts was annoying. The mohawks and tomahawks were out of line. It was like Dances With Wolves against the Pawnee."
2,very good..,"I just laughed at the torture that earl was enduring by desiring an american and unable to resist her. and she just did not put up with his arrogance, so spunky and the earl could not figure out what it was that he could want her so."
2,Eighties Style,"This is a Harrison Ford acting cute movie as opposed to a Harrison Ford acting tense (or ""Frantic"") movie. The style is perfect 80s filmmaking which may be why it was not well-received when it came out. People were no longer expecting this style. The movie is fun and goes down easily as most 80s crime movies did e.g. Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop. The supporting cast makes this movie extra fun with lots of fan favorites and cameo appearances like Lena Olin, Dwight Yoakum, Isaiah Washington and for Buffy fans, New York Slayer - K.D. Aubert."
2,Second brain holds clues for first brain problems,"I am a neurological development consultant who has read this book thoroughly and concur with the findings from a developmental point of view. I found this book a must read for anyone who has a developmentally challenged child or adult. In working with brain disorders and brain injuries, I always look to the bowel in the course of the examination because, 'if the bowel ain't happy, the brain ain't either!' There is so much more that is not in this book about the bowel that affects the brain that it would take several volumes of books to elaborate on what is already known today.

1,It is very big and Very Ugly,"I guess I was thinking about the rocking horse that I had when I grew up. It was pretty. This horse is so ugly. It is very big for an almost two year old - long fall down that is. So unfortunately, we have put it away till he gets older/taller. On the positive side, the springs are wrapped so that your child can not pinch their fingers. It does make sounds which is cool."
1,Another great game that might have been from Bethesda,"Like its predecessor, 'Morrowind' promises great things, shows potential for achieving those ends, and fails. The gameplay itself is superb, with open-ended character development and a large game world which allows for countless hours of exploration.And also countless hours of desktop crashes (which require a reboot), horrendous lag/framerate problems and everybody's favourite memory from 'Daggerfall,' the fall through the world. Actually, PRIOR to the patch, I didn't experience much by way of CTD, but now it occurs after about 15 minutes of game play, and without fail. Maybe in 6-12 months the game will be sufficiently patched to achieve stability, allowing me to return to the wonderful world-setting Bethesda has created. Until then, however, the CD will have to collect dust. Even with a high-end system configured to run this game efficiently, I have yet to be able to experience ""Morrowind"" without extraordinary frustration and disappointment."
2,GREAT for all ages!,"We gave the stomp rocket as a gift to a three year-old boy. Of course he loves it. The best part is who else loves it! His 30-something parents, his 5 year-old sister and her friends and basically anyone who visits their yard. Adults love to see how far they can make the rockets go, kids love to use up all of their excessive kid energy stomping on the stomp mechanism. We just purchased another one for ourselves - will be put to good use by our 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old daughters. Great value - great fun. It's also quite safe - all the parts are soft, so even if a child, car, house, etc. gets hit, there is no injury or damage."
2,Format makes good use of my time,"I really like this program and wouldn't change a thing. The ""audio flashcard"" format really works for me, and addresses the fundamental difficulty of learning any language: gaining critical mass of vocabulary. Over the past three months I have fairly well memorized the 1500 words and phrases of level one, and will soon start level II. Mostly this has been on my commute. Two disclaimers: this is an invaluable supplement to some other course-- it will not teach you how to make a sentence in Swedish. The other is that there is no effort to make this entertaining, so those that expect an enging story or song might be dissappointed. Me, I find anything that makes such efficient use of my time enjoyable, and I am grateful for the help the course has been."
2,Worth the Read: Apples Just As Good As Oranges,"This is the second book I've read by this author. 'Strange Doings' is definitely different than Gracely's first book (Giant Rat of Sumatra), but still worth the read. I have to pretty much agree with everything said by the reviewer from Philadelphia who likewise rates this 4 stars. Let me just add that although this who-dun-it has, in fact, a relationship between morality and art, not everyone with blood on their hands turns out to be a Modernist. On a different note, it's nice to see this author branching out a bit: this story appears to be 2 to 3 times longer than his first book, and certainly strikes a contrast in content."
2,A great book . Very helpful PL/SQL,"This is an excellent beginner's book for programmers. It begins with an emphasises on the basics of creating tables with declarative constraints. Following this is an easy-to-understand graphical and written description of how to use database triggers to enhance the integrity of the database; then several chapters on PL/SQL. What I liked most about this book is the plain and simple approach to some complex topics. I would recommed this book to any technical person who wants to learn Oracle quickly. I almost didn't buy it because the key word ""PL/SQL"" is not in the title but it certainly provides nice coverage of PL/SQL, not just the language syntax but an intuitive meaning of the package specification and body."
2,More evidence that 4AD was brilliant...,"This was the template for an entire era of production using samples and processors. As a youngster who bought this 12"" in 1986-87, I found it to open up an entire world of soundscapes and production concepts.What I liked even more than PUTV was the little treasure hidden as the B-Side called ""Anitina (First Time I See She Dance)"". This track was a sharp contrast to the bouncy A-Side hit: dark, moody, and dense with distorted guitars, feedback, and real-time delay treatments. The B-side was more in line with the rest of the progressive and experimental 4ad catalog, and likely was under appreciated by the average consumer of this title. For my 7th grade ears, it was a glimpse into a very creative period for European alternative music."
2,Great Resource for Beginning Stargazers,Really happy I got this for my 12 yr old grandson. He's really going to enjoy this with his new telescope to help him find the constellations plus just fun that he can have it inside in his room 'lit up' on the page.
2,My mother loved it,My mother likes big number pads and she uses the memory features when they are easy to understand. The phone has 2 prominent memory buttons in addition to the others and I put in my cell number and my sister's and she loves it. People over 65 will use technology if it is well designed. She's very happy with it.
2,Pure psycho-noir,"This one surprised the hell out of me. At first, it seems to be a rather typical P.I. story, featuring a stalwart hero with an overdeveloped sense of justice a la Mike Hammer. But slowly, over the first half of the book, Zeltserman starts revealing ugly little bits of the ""hero""'s psychosis... and by the time you're halfway through FAST LANE you begin to realize you're reading about a real messed-up bastard. As it all plays out toward the inevitable end and Johnny Lane's predicament gets worse and worse, you almost want to cover your eyes. This is pure psycho-noir here, expertly told, as if Jim Thompson or Charles Willeford had taken a stab at a Mike Shayne type novel. Beautiful and terrible."
1,horrible...,"I bought these marker not just once but twice, the first time I purchase the 5 primary colors and found that the marker would not write on harden chocalate... I figured it was just a bad batch so I bought a halloween 2 marker set,, well the same thing didn't work!!! Do not purchase these marker what a waist of money!!!!!"
1,a few facts at four leaf clovers,"i am featured in this book, my four leaf clover distribution is covered in the last chapter, there are several inaccuracies because the interview was done via transatlantic telephone call and i was not given the opportunity to proofread it. Our Gritbins were marked, grit and determination (not Grim and Determination) my husband is called Alexander not William, I studied at University of Wales Caerleon (not Claereon), and our clover scientist is Terry (not Penny) Michaelson Yeates,Please if you buy this book, print this and add it as a footnote!"
1,Overrated,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units, and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me, especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all, so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options, and if they weren't on sale, it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries, I cant get the things out."
1,"Sorry, Dante....","The author may be a Dante scholar but he is not yet a secure novelist. The Dante twist is a clever, entertaining plot device but the characters are dreadfully flat. The author supplies clues that are helpful in identifying the characters but these clues become annoying in a very short time: if facial hair is mentioned, it's Lowell; if a recalcitrant son is nearby, it's Holmes; if it's Annie Allegra asking for help with homework, it's Longfellow. I won't go into the maggots and blowflies...."
1,MAC not 100% friendly - check compatibility with your OS on the web.,"I have spent hours to have this drive working to finally learn on web forums that it was not compatible with OS 10.4.10, despite the Mac compatibility logo on the box !The non compatibility is known from the manufacturer and identified on their website : compatibility is OK for prior versions anyway - Check OS Compatibility.5 stars for amazon which managed the reimbursement perfectely."
2,"It's like a ""One of a Kind"" BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD DVD","If you are a collector of BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD Movies, then this DVD is your best bet!PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONBeavis and Butt-head, MTV's metal-head morons, finally conquer the big screen in this on-the-road, on-the-run comic adventure. The boys run into real trouble when--and this really sucks!--their all-important television set is stolen and they get mistaken for a pair of hit-men hired to ""do"" a man's sexy wife. Their misunderstood task takes them from Vegas to D.C., with plenty of hilarity but nary a music video in sight. Beavis' wired alter-ego Cornholio's rampage through the White House is a particularly twisted highlight."
2,comeback,"Kate Bush returns with an innovative album. Gone is the muddled production that plagued ""Hounds of Love"". This double CD is crisp and calls again to be played loud. Yes, she has lost some of her voice dynamics, but especially the second CD, ""a Sky of Honey"" is addictive, reminding of ""the Dreaming"". It also feels more rounded and whole then the first CD ""a Sea of Honey"". A powerful reminder that a long hiatus doesn't mean a creative drought. The samples of birds add a nice touch as does the creative use of a blackbird's song wave pattern as album art. Worth the wait."
2,Not as good as other books in the series but still fun.,"This is one of the better ones in the Big Book Of Series. It is not a jaw dropper like Big Book of Conspiracies or Big Book of Weird, but it is still a fun read.I was not born until the 80's, but I thought this book was great. I never knew that Kissinger could be an intresting guy. This is all the cool stuff that you never got to see in That 70's Show. From the Son of Sam murders to the Pet Rock and the Brady Bunch it covers the wackiest decade with some amazing art work.I just hope they do a Big Book of the 80's some day."
1,Welcome to the meatgrinder of dice throwing,"This isn't your typical Axis and Allies game. It uses similar component's regarding the board and pieces and the combat system is familiar but diffrent in many ways, but the production phase is skipped altogether and you receive random reinforcements in its place.Historic detail is nice. Most places of importance of the Normandy Campaign are on the map and the military units are named on the reinforcement boards so you get to know what you play with.The problem is with the game itself. There is very little room for tactical play and basically it is a meatgrinder of dice throwing. This maybe fun a couple of times but after that you will not be playing the game that much.I have the feeling that this game was rushed in the 60 year anniversary of D-Day and could have done with a little more playtesting."
2,Great watch,"I own the same watch but with the black dial, Purchased this one as a favor for a friend, You can read my review for the same watch in my other review. It is a great wathc and superb price."
1,But I love Fear Street!,"Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please ""adults"" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books."
2,Become a better baker with this book,"This is one of the most frequently used cookbooks in my kitchen. The recipes are easy to understand and although laborious at times, the effort is often worth it. I feel that this book has helped me improve my cooking/baking skills tremendously. I would suggest the recipient of this book obtain a heavy duty mixer, since many of the recipes require its use. Julia and her co-author conspirators display a helpful humor, advising the consulting cook not to worry when things look like they shouldn't. I highly recommend this book and have purchased it as a gift for several friends. The beautiful pictures are a great inspiration, as well."
1,Not as good as their debut,"Not nearly as musically interesting as their debut, self-titled, disc. On Looking Through, the tracks seem to blend together with no amazing standout tracks. I suppose you can give them props for not trying to hard to produce a single, but it feels like they didn't try to hard to produce any truly great songs.If you're new to PMM, get their self-titled disc. Looking Through is mostly for the hardcore fans who are mostly interested in supporting a band who showed tremendous potential with their first album."
1,return this now,All Star Baseball 2003 is one of the most overrated baseball game I have ever played. It is almost impossible to hit the ball. And when your in the field and A batter hits a fly ball the camera trys to look real by moving in slowly and if its a line drive it will go past you. On rookie mode the ball comes in so fast its almost impossible to hit the ball. To many strikeouts and too little game play. In the instruction manual it tells you nothing.
1,Don't waste your time,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I recently watched the progenitor film, 28 Days Later, and I was pleasantly surprised; for a trite genre, the movie had real character development, tension, some out-and-out scary scenes and some personal drama. This movie? Not so much.Let me preface by saying that I am a huge fan of Robert Carlyle: I think he's one of the best actors working today. And this movie started out well; the first 20 - 30 minutes laid the groundwork for a great story. But it all degenerated into gore, cheap FX, and beyond-stupid ""don't go down to the dark basement alone"" horror movie gimmickry.If I could, I'd give it 1 and 1/2 stars; because *hate* is a bit too strong, but truly: this is 2 hours I'm never getting back."
1,Not the actual poems,This was a critique and write up on the poems on the early poems of Tennyson. I could not actually find the poems I was wanting to read.
2,Very entertaining. Keyes is back after 2 duds!,"I almost didn't want to read Keyes's new novel after I skimmed through Angels and Sushi for Beginners. But I highly enjoyed it and as with previous Keyes novels, could not put it down. The end chapters kind of dragged, however, so I skimmed through those, but all in all, I'd recommend this book for summer reading."
2,Deep,Birdie and Morgan are both complete opposites: Birdie worry's about school and her ex-best friend and all Morgan thinks about is the sea. This book is great with surprising deadly twists and an excellent ending. Recommended for middle school students. I LOVE THIS BOOK!
2,Below a Masterpiece?,"I heard ""Gallery in Black"" over a random Internet Radio Station, and was immediately hooked.. I *HAD* to have this album. I ordered it as quickly as I could, and when it arrived, I was stunned. This CD is flawless.. I only wish I could've heard about Mindfield sooner."
1,"Should be entitled ""Simple Resumes for Top Attorneys only""","This is probably the worst book I've ever reviewed on the subject. Sure, it's great if you are an attorney from a top 10 school at the top 20% of your class, but still are not bright enough to figure out the most basic of tactics. True, the gatekeepers for the elite jobs are not authorized to think outside of the box, and therefore resumes based on these tips will appeal to them; on the other hand, there is no reason that these attorneys should have to put more than a cursory search together as these employers will be chasing them. As to the rest of us presumably unqualified professionals, the book is of absolutely no relevance. Based on this, I presume that the authors (legal recruiters) are likewise only interested in finding jobs for the papered best and brightest."
1,Bad taste,"Good for making flowers, leaves, piping; but not for frosting an entire cake. It has a waxy, stale, artifical flavor."
2,MY son's verbal comments about this book.,"This book was purchased for my son, so I am only going by his comments. He has struggled with addiction for years and is diligently reading this book. He told me that this is the first thing he has read or heard that really describes what he has been going through. and he has been in several rehab programs. And that this book has helped him see things a little more clearly. Currently he is working on recovery, and he feels this book has had a lot to do with helping him in that regard."
1,TERRIBLE,"Miserable read. Completely unrealistic and one-track BS - only about community policing. This book seems to be written by some retired policeman that is so far removed from the reality of day-to-day operations that makes one believe some of this to be fiction. Too many references to ""when I was an officer"". Several days of my life that i will never get back. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY ! ZERO STARS but unfortunately, that was not an option."
1,Broke on 1st use,"Avoid this product at all costs. The cheap little attachments that the dough is forced through are flimsy plastic and if your dough is even slighty too hard, they break. Ronco warranty won't cover them. So your stuck with a useless piece of plastic"
2,Good Stuff!,"So far I've used this product about 4 times (every 5 days) and I like it but I don't LOVE it. The very first time I used it I felt like I noticed a difference in my face but after the first use I don't really feel like I see a difference after using this product. But...this instructions did say that you really start to see results after the sixth application. I'm going to continue using this product though because I think it's better to have it than not.The first time you use it, it's amazing. My mositurizer seemed to sink into my skin deeper, if that makes any sense. I did get little white heads on my face the next day but I think that normal because the same thing happened when I got a facial at the spa. The white heads are very small and not really noticable so don't worry. Plus they go away in like a day or so."
1,WISH IT WAS THE ORIGINAL B than B,"Used to listen to Micheal here in the Twin Cities at some of the local clubs when I was attending the U.of M.in the late 60's and early 70's. Sadly, all my old tapes and records are shot. Wish I could get a c.d. of the original B than B, and For All You Mad Musicians.Still attend his concerts at Northrup at the U. Any one have access to any of his old stuff?"
1,Must Have Changed the Recipe or Manufacturing Process,"My friend gave me a bag of Snapea Crisps and I thought it was tasty so I purchased a case (12 bags) from Amazon. The manufacturer must have changed the recipe or how the peas are processed. This product is no longer tasty, as a matter of fact, it tastes like cardboard. If I could return the other 11 packages I would. Calbee whatever you've done, go back to the old recipe."
1,"product didnt work, terrible online chat support - dont buy","the product didnt work out of the box. after 5 hours of online chat support, it still didnt. the chat support was very frustrating - i kept losing the reps on the other end and being assgned reps who knew nothing of the product. apparently the reps sign off without telling you when they cannot fix your problem. this should have been an easy install because my other gear is also linksys. not so. i plan to return it tomorrow."
1,"Good premise, but the delivery falls short.","It would have been a better story if there were more escapees, a more diverse group rather than just criminals. It seems like the boys didn't get much of a role, and Al and Lodgepoole did all of the work. The plot wasn't nearly as convolutedly awesome as it is in some of the other books in the series, and it was all just too flat and predictable. Maybe it's the switched author? I really don't know, but I miss the style of the other Eerie, Indiana books."
1,"Does not align with Scripture, not a Christian book","If you have spent anytime in Scripture, you will recognize quickly that this book does not bear truth. It adds to Scripture unabashedly and even misquotes it. Do not buy this book if you believe the God of the Bible and are searching for a closer relationship with God. The god of this book is not the God of the Bible. There are authors who are devoted to only spreading the truth...look for them."
2,Dasam Granth,At last the work of the Tenth Sikh master has come to the English speaking world. It is of great use to see this text in English. The English although at times very much Indian English is welcome nevertheless. The literature of the Tenth Sikh guru reflected his cosmopolitian knowledge of the lanuages of North India and Persia and for many this will be the only access to this difficult text. Many have found parts of this book to be 'Racy'' but the authors have handled it all well. As Sikhism becomes increasingly a worldwide dharma this book should find its way into every Sikh home where English is spoken. The Sikh community should all support the work of its scholars by obtaining this fine transcendental literature
1,Bad Product,This product does not do what I purchased it for. It is completely useless to me now. It does not take the lyrics out of the songs as it advertises.
2,Brazil 66,"I love this CD of Brazil 66. I bought the album back in the 60s...now with the CD I can listen to these beautiful songs while I am driving. If you're a fan of Brazil 66, this is a great buy."
2,An engrossing and realistic page-turner!,This book was fabulous and I can't wait for more featuring Amelia and Lincoln Rhyme. The Bone Collector is by far my favorite Deaver book and the follow-up was also wonderful.The story has it's quirks and they all work. The story is realistic and well written. The characters are well formed and likable. Deaver gives you just enough background info to keep you wanting more but not too much so that it takes away from the plot.This book was recently made into a movie - since the book is one of my favorites I saw the film - while decent it just does not hold a candle to the book. The book leaves no loose ends and Jeffery Deaver really fleshes the characters out. This is NOT your average serial killer novel nor is Lincoln your average detective.I highly recommend this one - it will keep you up all night reading because you just can't put it down.
2,X-mas Classic,"This is One of the biggest christmas classics of all time.. It's a christmas tradtion in my house to sit and watch this movie with the family.. Who can forget Mr. Shellhammertell Mrs. Walker ""He's a born Salesman...I can Feel it!!!!"" I know it's a little goofy but Nothing better then Christmas time a couple of drinks and making fun of some of the lines in the movie... Buy this movie and have a Merry Christmas...P.S. Don't buy the cheap remakes of this Christmas Classic..America makes to many remakes as it is.."
1,Great Book. Terrible Edition.,"This will be brief. Buy the Ignatius edition. For an explanation, see most 1* reviews."
2,Not that good,"Fobia is definitely one of the most popular bands in Mexico, I thought this cd was going to be a Greatest Hits but a half of the Fobia on Ice album, What a s**t!!!!"
1,"A thin, underwritten disappointment.","I went into this book with high expectations, seeing as how there are so many people who enjoyed it. It read more like a plot outline than an actual novel, with thin characters, sketchy descriptions, little sense of mood or atmosphere, and a plot one finds it hard to care two cents about. Too bad, as I really wanted to like it. The point of view of Croaker is mildly interesting, but never really developed into a character driven piece that engages the reader. And all that silliness between One-Eye and Goblin... puh-lease. I guess if you've read every other fantasy ""formula"" out there, you might find this one diverting. As for me, I'm still finding much more interesting fare to read..."
2,Geocaching with eTrex Legend,"We have been geocaching 9 months now now with our Legend, and have had no troubles at all. Accuracy has been great, down to 3 feet, in some instances. Battery life is as advertised or better. The unit holds up well to minor tumbles and everyday abuse with out a scratch. Our only complaint is the size of the display, wished it was a little bigger. A great entry level unit, would buy another."
2,The best!,Spider-man is the greatest game boy game you could possibly make!The only thing I don't like is its to short I beat it in like one week but its still cool cause you can still play the game over and over. And after you beat the game you get level cheat were you can skip levels. And if you beat the game with over 15000 points you get super strength. I recomened this game if you like spiderman or not. This game will make you love spiderman.
2,What fun!,"At Christmas I found all sorts of fun and useful food gifts to make from this book. Homemade liqueurs, jellies...If you like to cook and hate all the extra ingredients in processed foods, this one's a keeper."
2,Amazing...,"My house floorplan is extremely spunky. That also means that setting up my WiFi network was going to be extremely difficult.Up until the point that I bought this antenna, I spent a total of $400 trying to get all my signal strength bars up to max, but rather, ended up getting mediocre connectivity, with occasional connection drops.After installing the antenna, I get perfect signal, without the use of any repeaters in between. Hawkings is truly the best IMHO, especially when the quality of home/office networking gear is going to sh**. I just hope that the frequencies don't cause any long term health effects :)"
1,Horrible product. Doesn't soak up water.,"Not working as expected or intended. I washed my car and I dried soaking up the water stains with this chamois. Nope, it hardly soaked up anything.Do not buy."
2,"One exciting game; Final score Congress 1, President 0.","This book read like a successful meld of Tom Clancy and Keith Douglass(""Carrier""). An exciting techno thriller utilizing the American Constitution as the focal point for military action against terrorism. Author Huston, a former Naval aviator, really nails down all the battle components, whether they be with Marines on the ground, Seals all over the place, and fighter pilots eating up the sky. If you don't yet have this book...buy it. One warning...when you are done, you will have a tremendous longing for more. A truly good outing for Huston. Bravo!"
2,Love my Kindle,"Very handy esp when travelling,no need to carry a lot of heavy books.Enjoy reading and Kindle has made it more fun and easy, no need to go to bookstore to buy the books, just order directly on my kindle,so easy to do.One of the best buy I had done.Love my kindle,it has given me so much pleasure."
2,Do Not Read the Editorial Review,"Do not read the above editiorial review if you want to fully appreciate this film, as it gives away the plot. Ed Harris plays an American spy, Gus Lang. He works for both the British and Germans during the period immediately before DDAY. He is sent to Paris where a young but brilliant American officer, one of a handful of allied soldiers who knows the actual DDay plans, has been captured and is being interrogated by the Germans. The Allies direct Lang to prevent the young American from talking. The Germans use Lang to try coercing the American to reveal the Allies DDay plans. The fun of this movie revolves around not knowing Gus Lang's real intentions. Add the fact that one of the German officers involved in the interogation is working for the Allies, but which one? This is a smart, well written script, with strong characters by a fine cast."
2,Some gems and one clunker,"Davidson is one of my favorite authors, and this selection includes one of his best stories, ""The Lord of Central Park.""However, I was disappointed by the title novella. I got the impression that Davidson was trying to imitate Michael Moorcock at his most ideosyncratic. The writing was sparkling, as usual, but I just wasn't enthralled by his point.I recommend interested readers to start elsewhere, perhaps with ""the Investigations of Avram Davidson"" or ""The Phoenix and the Mirror,"" great short stories and a staggeringly original novel, respectively."
1,Unfortunate,"I was hoping that Darren Hayes debut solo album would have some artistic merit, but unfortunately I was wrong. The entire album was charted out like any other bubble gum artist. Don't get me wrong Savage Garden were pop but they also wrote and played the instruments (or the better half did anyway), and its obvious to anyone that listens that Daniel Jones was the talent and Darren was merely a interpretive singer. That being said there are a couple enjoyable songs ""Good Enough"" being the only one that strives for a definitive sound that isn't already to cliched.Darren shame on you for selling out and doing anything the execs wanted in order to sell albums, where is your pride in this contrived mess of bubblegum? I'm hoping maybe it will grow on me....."
2,Pocket Recipes 5 Stars,"This is a Great Product! I buy a lot of cookbooks and I've purchased cooking software in the past, but being able to carry this around with you on your Visor is really convenient. This product gives you thousands of recipes, but the best feature by far is the shopping list. When you choose recipes, the exact amount of ingredients required are added to your shopping list automatically. I would highly recommend this product."
2,Great Product,"I have Windows XP Pro. I installed the software first, like the directions said. Software iustallation took one minute. Then I plugged the adapter into the USB port and I was connected wirelessly after windows installed the driver automatically. It took less than 3 minutes all together. The speed is terrific and the price was right, as was the installation. Great product! Highly recommended."
1,The author needs some wisdom and compassion...,"This author would have sold a book to me if he had shown courage and dignity, as well as friendship, in the Don Imus incident. Mr. Imus put this man on the best seller list often and he had him on his show frequently. But Mr. Russert did not come through for Don Imus and unfortunately, I will not spend another penny on Russert's books nor will I ever watch Meet the Press again!"
2,Got my interest,"Like Schindler's story, Giardina's novel introduces to us a story that some of us may never have known before. This novel introduced me to a real figure who is very inspiring and very human. Too many historic ""heroes"" seem like myths or memories. Giardina cures this illness by making Bonhoeffer real, and making him exist once again. It is both an important and well told story, based on something terrifying and real. This is the novel that developed my interest in Bonhoeffer and his life.Giardina teaches at West Virginia State College, the school that I attend. I have had the opportunity to take her Fiction Writing Workshop class. A friend recommened this novel to me. It remains my favorite Giardina novel. Serious, but entertaining. Touching and compassionate. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read."
2,This book is thought prevoking as well as inspiring.,The lines of poetry draw you in with their power and energy. Spirit and Warrior are especially moving and powerful.I think every reader will get their own meaning to each section and no two will be the same.
2,boomtown,"I have watched Boomtown and was very diapointed it was cancelled, everytime something good comes on it,s cancelled, why?? who makes these desistions ? why don,t you let the viewers make soom desisions on some of these programs, you see you have to many good ones on at the same time, i feel thats the problem, everyone wants the money///"
2,Nice and Cute Stuff,It works really well. The room is getting much more comfortable. And it looks really cute! We love it!! STRONGLY RECOMMEND
1,A Long Summer,Over the summer I had to read this book as part of a school assignment. This book was very long even though it contains only 208 pages. Willa Cather over explains many details in this book. I would reccomend this book to absolutely no one.
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!,"It is an understatement that this novel was just plain ridiculous! After reading the section about ""what really happened to Hoffa"", I felt like I swallowed a golf shoe. The character suffers the tired old adage...a hit man with a tortured soul. The love scence between the main character and the single mother on the run is straight out of Penthouse Forum. I need to gargle. There is still a bad taste in my mouth! Hint: A little less Dungeons and Dragons and a little more research into the field."
2,Masterpiece - plain and simple!!!,"Amazing!!! I Love how E.Lynn Haris keeps his readers up to date on all of his charaters. There is no one he won't touch with this novel. I was truely blessed by this fragile subject matter. ""Does my love for God go away because I love men?"" There are so many black men in churches all over the country wondering if God truely loves them. What if I like being BI sexual? Can I still live a life blessed by God? Harris, says yes!! Why not? When you think of all the young people in your church, ask yourself the same question.This was a funny, endearing, supersing, and well thought out piece of life. HOLD ON, and Enjoy the ride!! You won't believe who you'll see along the way."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Absolute garbage! Unfortunaltely zero stars is not an option. ""Konedog"", tell your employer, Cutter, to stop selling crap plastic applicators! This sprayer is so cheap and poorly designed that you are destine to wind up wearing more bug spray than you'll ever get on your yard. The hose end coupler is too deep (tried it on two different hoses) so there is water leaking/spraying all around the coupling even before you begin to spray. Once you get going the draw tube is rediculously ineffective and isn't moving material. Try bumping up the pressure to draw something out of the container and the hose coupler pops of the cheap snap-on fitting to the spray nozzle. I threatened my wife that if she ever bought another Cutter product I would promptly drive her back to store to obtain a refund.Ortho, Bonide, Raid...any of them have to be better than the garbage Cutter is trying to pass off."
2,"Fanny, The BEST All-Female Rock Group...EVER!","Okay, buy this CD, but while you are at it, go over to Rhinohandmade.com and buy the Fanny box set: ""First Time in a Long Time: The Reprise Recordings."" YES! Finally, their first four studio albums on CD, plus b-sides, demos, live recordings, etc. I received mine the other day--wonderful! The sound quality on this live CD leaves something to be desired, but on the Fanny box set, the songs never sounded better! The box set also includes some songs from this live performance. From this live CD, I especially liked the versions of ""Charity Ball"" and ""Knock on my Door."" Fanny fans and fans of good solid rock music, buy these Fanny CD releases--buy 'em out and maybe, if we are lucky, there will be more Fanny CD reissues in the mass market!"
1,"Awful bed, save your money!",The lining on this bed tore the day after I got it. After the first wash the exterior looked used and old and then the foam eventually came unglued. I wrote to Dog Bed King twice about how upset I was and they never even responded. I will never buy from them again and suggest you do the same.
1,yes this party going rong,this is not what is happening they lose it again and iam not happy try again spice girl wanna bees
2,"""..let me introduce you to Marilyn Manson..""","This is an AMAZING tape. It really captures the true essence of marilyn and everything that he stands for. If you're a ""new manson famiely member"", or just want to know more about him, then this is the tape to watch (hence the title of this review).The tape begins with a bunch of his best videos. It starts off with his melodic, tearfull JFK video, ""coma white""; diminishing any sick shock rock steriotype thoughts you might have of him rite from the start. Some of the others are ""dont like the drugs"", ""the dope show"", ""the man that you fear"", and also some originals from 1989 through the early 90's like ""get your gunn"", lunchbox"", and ""sweet dreams"".It also has some great live footage, some quite x-rated. If you're a homophobe, i suggest you dont watch it...And ofcorse some halarious backstage footage that lets you get to know his band aswell, and a short interview with marilyns parents.It's a VERY good tape. You WONT be sorry for buying it."
2,A new brushing experience.,I've had this brush for a month now. The vibrating brushing experience is different but effective. i like the feeling like you're massaging you gums as you brush. A great value from amazon and I hope my next check up shows an inproved cleaning performance. I have sensative gums and this brush helps with a easy brushing tachnique. Holds a charge well and ergonomics are good. The only reason I don't give it five stars is due to expense of replacement brushes. About $10-$15 each.
2,What can you say but funny.,"You put these two guys in a movie and you know what your going to get. It is so funny. And the special effects are awesome, I love it and the other two are just as good."
1,Not for my HP430 plotter.,Don't buy the TRENDnet USB to Parallel 1284 Converter for plotters. It doesn't work. Finally got product-maker agent to tell me as much. Packaging doesn't say that it doesn't work for some parallel-port products.
1,Absolutely no respect for the consumer.,"Grow up, New Line. Do not buy this set. It does not feature the extended editions of the films."
2,Excellent!,"I've been wanting to read these boos for sometime, after returning from a vacation to New Orleans I was finally motivated to read them. I love a good vampire novel and this series so far has been the best! I think my next read will be more of the follow ups to this set of three and also the new graphic novel, Claudia s story."
2,Great Christmas read.,"The description inside talks about pictures. There was only text, no pictures in the Kindle version. Drawings would have been nice."
2,Great Keyboard,I've had this keyboard now for over 5 years now and it's a great keyboard. My own issues with it was that the programmable keys shared F keys and to switch to programmable mode you had to hide a button. During this mode though your F keys didn't work and it ended up being an annoyance. But it's a great keyboard for the price. Nowadays all the keyboard prices are going up because of wireless and other options but this is a great simple wired keyboard with media options.
1,Again?,"""Guncrazy"" is a mediocre movie at best, unfortunately. However, if you want to see a 17-year old Drew in (yet again) sexual situations (none of which are good), then this is the movie for you. It combines the ""I married an ex-con"", ""I like guns"", and ""I'm a sexually troubled girl"" plots into yet another movie.Directed by Tamra Davis, who made at least one pretty good movie (""Skipped Parts""), she is not totally without talent. The movie was written by Matthew Bright, who wrote ""Freeway"" a few years earlier, so he has talent as well. Included are Drew Barrymore, Ione Skye and a couple other notable names, however, they display no real talents here.I guess the dialog is the weakest link. Some of it just sounds bad or out of place.There are no extra features. You could do worse, but not by much."
2,Really works!,"An all natural supplement that works wonders in combating my mild depression in the colder months attributed to SAD (Seasonal affective disorder.) Would recommend as an alternative to costly prescriptions and antidepressants, a holistic and natural approach."
1,don't forget your machete.,"While the book is a very informative one, Keegan is apparently talented in the art of digression. He spends the fist sixty-four pages of his literary labor extolling the virtues of America and its inhabitants, and describing (to what end, I cannot tell) his innumerable vacations, trips, and adventures in and about North America. He also (for reasons similarly ambiguous) chooses to include in this preface, a roundabout, labyrinthine discourse on his personal thoughts and experiences to do with England and France in addition to his lengthy (but vaguely on topic) treatise on America. These commentaries are, unlike the rest of the book, absolutely unreadable, forgettable, and just bad. One must plod through them, all the time conscious of mounting apathy and distaste. Their relevance is very near nihility and their pith very near brimful."
2,Awesome!,"This sheet is an great deal! Its very soft, washes up well and very well priced. I very much recommend it."
1,"Cheap, Poor Quality","I bought this really for one game, but this really is a joke. It's of poor construction and actually displayed the picture worse, with several fast moving lines. Not caused by interference with other cords, it is the cord itself that is the issue."
1,BEWARE,"I have purchased Ray-Ban glasses for many years. Recently, I got a bad pair and I was happy that I was dealing (though I was dealing) with a high end company. Well, this is not the case with Ray-Ban. The warranty department is nearly impossible to reach and they do not honor the 1yr defect policy. Mine fell apart at the hing and they wanted about 3/4 of the price to fix them! I'm not going to purchase from this company any longer and I recommend that you do the same."
2,Addictive,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsI was so happy to find this game, it is one of the only 3 harry potter games available for mac. I literally couldn't stop playing it until i finished. The graphics are pretty good, and the storyline is fairly interesting. It is definitely an improvement on harry potter and the sorcerer's stone game!"
1,Waste of Money,"This book is a waste of money - I bought it thinking I was going to learn something new - the BIG revelation -Woman want to be treated as people - there I told you - so don't waste your time or your money....Mary Lou Quilan states the obvious again and again, it is not worth the [$$$]."
1,Lamp life unreliable,I purchased the lamp on June 2009. It worked fine at first but then stopped working at the end of October 2009 which was not even less than 6 months later. These lamps are supposed to last about 3 years if you use it regularly. My projector is in a family room that we only used about twice a week for no more than 5 hours. They took a week to send me a replacment. The lamp stopped working again in early May 2010. I contacted the seller and they said the lamp hours are not reliable. They offered me a discount rate to purchase another one for $149. I was disgusted. I would not purchase another lamp from this seller so that in 6 months it can go out again.D. Markham
1,Not what promised. Beware.,"The picture shows the limited storybook edition which includes both R and X versions. What I actually received was just the R version. The cover received did not say ""limited storybook edition"". Amazon, you ripped me off!"
1,What the heck!,"Okay? I see a lot of great reviews for this game. Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game. I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics! then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive. Plus people say how shinobi looks cool???? I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while. And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics. Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2. This game really blows! It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone. Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short! The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it! Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it. Trust me!"
2,The mystery itself...,"...is quite cookie cutter. The solution is obvious from almost the beginning of the book and therefore, I almost rated this series entry only three stars. But, the writing is first-rate with the accuracy of the descriptions of 18th-century life. I do hope, however, that the next book in the series returns to the more complicated & sophisticated books that I have come to expect from Bruce Alexander."
2,acdelco ignition Control Module Assembly,mine went bad after 20 years got a new gm quality part at a fraction of the dealer price here at amazon
1,skips,"For some reason, my tape player thinks the tape needs to be flipped and constantly skips as it flips the tape."
2,Delonghi Indoor Grill BG24,"I needed an indoor grill and was not sure what to get. I took a chance on this grill. It is extremely wonderful to grill steaks, chicken, and fish. I have enjoyed being able to gril indoors. It works great. The delivery process was quick. There were not any problems."
2,California Rock,"It is so hard to believe it, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers still have maintained their rock edge for almost 25 exciting years, and they still have the appeal of making some great pop songs. Their latest single is definitely no acception to that rule. Dani California, the first single from the chilis' latest record Stadium Arcadium is a great song that is just driven, upbeat, and worth every bit of what the group has brought as their best within the past several years of following the success of tracks like Californication, Can't Stop, and By The Way. I absolutely like this song a lot, because it is just great to listen to. I just hope that more funky rock will continue from this legendary party group.Song: B 1/2+"
2,Its an oil filter,"What can I say, it is an oil filter. It fit and seems to function well, at least the motor has frozen yet (just kidding to get the required number of words)."
1,Philosophical rantings are off track,The movie is slow and seems jumbled together. There are philosophical rantings from a philosophy professor and a lot of talk about the game of chess. I like chess but when it becomes part of the theme of a movie then the word boring enters into the description. The scripting is poor and the director is low level at best. save your money.
1,Dark Empire is a disgrace to the name Star Wars.,"This story line shouldn't have even been allowed to enter the Star Wars galaxy. The problems I have with this story start from the beginning, the dialogue is too jerky. The characters say need less things and that interrupts the flow a real conversation would have. My next problem is the ""hyperspace wormhole"" that just sounds like Star Trek not Star Wars to me. My last two specific problems are with the illustrations, first they just look bad. The characters look totaly different than they do in the movies. The only one that looks similar to the movies is the cover. My other problem with the illustrations is that they all have a green or red tint. The story line just doesn't feel like Star Wars!!!"
1,A waste of time,"I found this book really wordy and boring, it put me to sleep. The whole idea of learning AIS from a textbook is just like trying to learn to use computer without a computer! The whole AIS operation circle isn't hard to comprehend, but learning it from hundred of pages of literature is a dumb idea. On top of that, I don't think I have to learn the definition of E-Business and its difference from Internet(is there a e-business operated without internet?!)."
1,save your money,We thought this was the screen door with the magnets that actually pull it together. It's not. It overlaps. It also seems to be a little longer in the middle than on the sides so it drags in the middle and you have to physically close it which defeats the purpose. Our last screen was a mesh drape. It worked better. With this product we have more flies and bugs. It's as if there is nothing on our door at all! They got their money off of me!
2,GREAT REMIXES OF OLDER TUNES!,"I AM REALLY ENJOYING THIS CD. I BASICALLY HAVE THESE TUNES ON WHEN I AM IN MY WORKOUT ROOM, RUNNING ON THE TREADMILL, ETC.LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AND DREAM WEAVER ARE MY TWO FAVORITE CUTS ON THE ALBUM, THEN VENTURA HIGHWAY IS A GREAT CUT TOO...BUT IT IS AN ALL AROUND GOOD CD!!! I HOPE WARNER COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER ONE SOON!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"Who is writing these reviews? ABC? This was a VERY GOOD series adaptation of a BBC series. Up until the ""finale"". If you plan on buying this set,watch every episode but please for the love of all things,DO NOT watch the last episode. They almost succeeded in destroying a decent show in 10 minutes."
1,Thousand dollars?,"These would be awesome to get BUT they use to be 40 dollars and now I see they have them listed at 999.99? That is just insane, who do these people think they are? I really wanted a pair but I would have to be legally insane to pay a thousand dollars for them, this should be illegal."
2,The true essence of skateboarding,"Mike V has the right attitude about skating. Long before it exploded, the corporations got involved and the term ""skater"" wasnt a social label, skating was about a culture, if you skated you were a member, there was little if any cliques' or divisions. It rarely mattered if you could ollie, didnt matter if you could could barely stand on the board if you skated and found skaters, you were with friends. This video conveys all that, it may not appeal to the younger crowd, but it it is representative of the way things used to be and the true meaning of skating. I skate with my 14 year old son...im 36....and the modern scene is pretty unappealing in a lot of ways. Seems if you dont skate rails and stairs your somehow not a skater....which is bulls***. Ive tried to explain to my son how it was to skate in the 80s, once he saw the Drive series he finally understood. Bravo to Mike V. for keeping it alive."
2,It looks easy but aint!,"This game is though...but not for me!i beat the game !lol!i have mega emg,belzelga,wonder A,rokusho,zorin,and many more...have trouble beating samantha at the beggining?Well use your head(Antenna)then the right arm(sword)and again right arm AND then left arm (pipo Hammer) yay!trouble agaist Squidguts??use anti sea !!"
2,One of the Best Resources Available,"While no one book can serve to be the sole authority on any topic, this one is one of the absolute best I have read. It is well worth the read. Better yet if you are struggling because your child has more energy than you do--you, your child, and your relationship with them is worth the read."
1,Worse than I Expected.,"The most offensive movie I've seen in a long time--a film about a couple vapid, unsympathetic people surrounded by pathetic caricatures of vapid and unsympathetic people. Maybe the movie was one big ironic joke...but it doesn't read that way. I consider liking this movie a character flaw."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Destroys many of the great ideas set forth in the first installment. Definitely a ""Don't watch"", both from a philosophical and from an Entertainment point of view."
1,Unrealistic Recipes,"We didn't find a single recipe that we would make a second time. We have since moved to a more realistic eating lifestyle of monitoring our sugar, fat, sodium, and calories as well as making sure we get the proper vitamins and minerals in our daily intake. I found myself dwelling on points all day long which meant I was thinking of food all day long."
1,Generic&Corny,"heard things about this film&I though it might have more to it but basically what is different between this film&freaky Friday? same type of concept&film. it's also a Insult to compare this film to Tom Hank's ""Big"" which was a Coming of Age Film for Hanks. Jennifer Garner is foxy chick,but Her Acting skills lets say are average at best. I also get so tired of all of these type of movies using the 80's music as there backdrop.they turn film into a Mini Music video as to a actual film."
1,This is it. I've had it.,"If you like the trendy Jars of Clay music, which is dragging every other artist in Christian music into a deep pit of boring ballads for the next 20 or 30 years, buy this album. If you are concerned about the fact that Petra's ministry has lost many fans over the past 2 years, email me at socko130@hotmail.comNow that i've let that out, I'm gonna pop in some of the old stuff. If you are mad at me, sorry. I just noticed that Petra is really weak right now. They haven't been on WOW for a few years either."
2,Does what it says at a great Amazon price,"Does what it says at a great Amazon price. A little goes a long way and doesn't get greasy. Though your hair will be a bit sticky, not something you would want to run your hands though."
2,A toy for every preschooler,"My three year old can't get enough of this learning toy. She sings, repeats letter noises and loves the different levels (ie. games, learning colors and music.) She really like having the two interchangable face plates for different activities (coloring plate and numbers with Leap and friends) The fact that it comes with three sets of the letter coloring sheets was great. I don't think I could have imagined the fun she is having. The positive feedback when correct numbers, colors or friends are found is great. If she can not find correct color or number it encourages her to keep trying by giving her little hints. (ie. the number 8 comes after 7 and is the color yellow.) The only problem- My 16 month old wants to play with it too!! I will be purchasing another one real soon. THIS TOY IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY PRESCHOOLER"
2,Only read Kresley Cole,I have to admit that I only bought this book for the Kresley Cole story but it was well worth it. She can simply do no wrong all her books are fantastic and I can never wait until the next one comes out. Sorry I can't comment on the other stories I'm sure I'll read them one day.
2,Funny,Some good letters in this book. It will make a great gift to my Uncle Leo who just celebrated his 98th birthday at the retirement center. He always likes a good laugh or prank.
2,All your favorites,"Classic CD. This cd has all of your favorite Van Halen songs, you will not be disappointed. Good classic rock and roll. Solid."
2,Good,The shipment was a little slow but the book was in really good shape. Overall I was quite satisfied with this seller.
1,Sucked,Did not meet expectation. It was not the video I was looking for that you can watch every seen in full.
1,007 with girl hair,It really is basically a Bond movie. Think about it. What a waste. Is Hollywood just going to [cull] all classic literature to create camp? Kids don't waste your time on this. Instead you might want to pick up Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' or Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' in a very old format called a book.
2,Nice little package,"Great little drive, superb for mailing files in a flat rate pack. Good performance"
2,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt: The Complete Series,This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I really hope their is a season 2.
2,Some Re-recording Done for the 1996 Remaster :-(,"The album was remastered and re-released in 1996, and much of the drum and bass playing was re-recorded, as well as additional vocals added. Three bonus tracks were also included. The merits of the reworkings are debatable; personally I don't like when things are messed with like George Lucas and his mucking with Star Wars, or the use of autotune on Let it Be. I want the original work of art, not the new and improved one. So I think the original 6 track cd or the LP are the ones to search out. The '96 mastering is excellent though, and there are no problems with the music except that it isn't the same music from 1971.This album shows Hawkwind moving away from the folk based sound of their debut to a heavy guitar, SF themed lyrics, spacey electronic sound. In addition, one can see elements of psych, prog, trance, and free jazz. It's quite the witches brew. If you have any interest in psyc/prog/space/stoner/70's rock, this in an essential album."
2,Packed with suspense to the fullest!!!,"A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."
1,Awful music,"Terrible lyrics, primitive music, poor taste. What happened to good old Russian Rock? Those who like this album just haven't heard any better of the Russian music. People, please, look at what you are listening--admitting to liking this music is like admitting to vulgar, unrefined taste."
1,Junk.,"Sucked. ""Broken on his spear""? Jeez. It's basically a silly and not particularly well-written ""romance"" novel (a genre which I generally despise) with fantasy overtones. Or is that redundant? I tossed it after reading half way through it."
1,The mix was wack!!!,"I have the video. It wasn't as good as I heard it was. Some videos are missing on the video like ""True To The Game"", ""Live & Die In LA"", ""Guy In Yellow"", ""Ready or Not."" The sound was low on some videos and the videos are taped in low quality. It has low volume the whole way. The videos are so incomplete. It is more of a puffy video than ice cube. Ice cube's videos bearly last like 30 seconds before they get cut off by Puffy's Full version. I think it is a a waste of money"
2,25 years experience with Mobil 1,"I won't use anything else in my cars. When I buy a car, I keep them and take very good care of them. My most experience with Mobil 1 was on my 1995 Eagle Talon TSi turbo which I bought new. I sold the car last year and the motor was still like new with 180,000 miles on it. Even the turbo was still like new. I used Mobil 1 from about 8k miles on. I sold it in August of 2008 to a young motor-head an he's since put another 20k on the motor. 200k on a turbo 4g63? that's some good oil. And when you checked inside the valve cover, like new. The cams had no wear. Seals on the motor never leaked. I currently run mobil 1 in all our cars which includes an '08 Toyota Avalon, '03 Maxima 6 speed, and an '02 accord. The accord has 140k on it, still running like new. I break in the new cars with dino then switch 'em to Mobil 1. I also extend the drain intervals to 7-10k."
2,Paint a room in no time!,"I bought the power roller when we moved into our new home. Once you figure out how to use it, and you MUST read the manual, it was a breeze. I painted two rooms and a hallway in under two hours. The only drawback is the cleaning of the roller. You have to take it apart and rinse every single piece. It could take between 30-60 minutes. Otherwise, it is a great machine."
1,Needs better information,"I ordered the PSD-200 and it was the wrong size. The PSD-210 would have fit my shower correctly, but I couldn't tell that, because the dimensions given for each part were useless. I needed to know the inner and outer diameters of the connector, but the PSD-200 gave a length and width (for a circular part?)and the PSD 210 description gave no info, at all. (The two parts have the same inner diameter, but the PSD-210 has a larger outer diameter.)I wound up taking the old connector (or what remained of it) to a local plumbing supply house and they matched it with a PSD 210 from their stock.I like being able to order parts like this online, but the descriptions need to be better."
1,Completely Overrated,"This flick was so hyped I just had to see it. What a waste. It's stupid, totally ridiculous throughout. Plot has more holes than the Houston Texans defense. Predictable, not even scary. I mean they never check the attic? Cut the comedy please. We never find out a thing about the girls, this guy or really just about anything. The other reviews are just so bad. Honestly, what were you watching? This flick is a dog with fleas. Trust me take a pass on this dud. A total miss."
1,Don't buy this CD,"Once again, Sony strikes. You can't put this on your iPod. Bette Midler: they're really targeting the artists with the criminal element as their fan base."
1,Much ado about nothing,"The dehumidifier is a great size, makes relatively little noise, and even gives off cooled air. The only downside? It doesn't really dehumidify. I used this product in my 5x8 bathroom for a few weeks, and it made no discernible difference in the bathroom's humidity level. I've used regular-sized dehumidifiers in the bathroom before, and they would fill up with water within a day; this product would take a week despite being 10x smaller. My mirror still fogged up, and my towels still stayed damp."
1,"This is a reference guide, not XML in plain English","You would think a book entitled ""...in Plain English"" would be about explaining a complicated subject in easily understandable terms. However, this book only gives a brief and very lame introduction to XML. Almost the entire book is a reference guide to the XML and XML related syntax. Since this information can be obtained over the Internet for free it is questionable why this book even exists (maybe that's why they didn't name it more appropriately ""Another XML Reference Guide"")."
2,HOT! HYPNOTIC!,"The Tyrese cd has got to be the best cd I have listened to ever! It's a good thing cd's are built to last because I've played it so many times, I worry that it will wear out! The Sweet Lady video sizzles so hot you almost get burned from the heat! The song ""You Get Yours"" is wonderful and great to dance to. ""Lately"" will rise to the top if the dj's are smart enough to play it! Can't wait to see more of Tyrese's videos and hope he continues to make such great cds. You all have to get this cd. You will not be disappointed. It's a true treasure."
2,Excellent book,One of the best books in the century. I finished the book a while back but decided to buy it as part of my. library collection
1,Delicate head phones,I was perfectly happy with these for about 2 months then the right side of the headphone broke. I taped it back together and a week later the left side broke. Now I am not rough on these head phones as I only listen to them when I'm sitting still on my computer. The sound quality was good but what good is the sound if they break. The construction of the pivot arms is very thin and cheap. Don't buy these they are not worth the money.
2,Very good quality cable,"Received the cable very quickly. Connected to my audio system and noticed the higher fidelity sound at a great price. However, opened up one of the connectors and the wiring was exposed. Better wiring insulation and some shielding should make this a better cable. You won't go wrong purchasing these cables for the low price. Good job Acoustic Research!"
1,Dreadful...Outdated design even for 10 years ago...,The interior design featured in this book was absolutely horrid. Even though this book is almost 10 years old I find it hard to beleive that garish clashing floral prints and variations of plaid were all the rage in 1997. Judging by the quality of BHG's magazines I expected so much more. Thank goodness I got it used for $1.59...
1,I hate wimpy women,"This book made me so mad. i can't buy that the heroine was so swept away by passion that she let the ""hero"" treat her this way. This is the person whose hands the fate of the world rest in. Boy are we in trouble. I got about halfway through the book and then ended up throwing it across the room. don't waste your time."
1,First one is better,This is a straight up slasher film. It has nothing to do with the first one. The first movie I liked because it was original and there was a hint of violence. It was scary without being disgusting. This movie is just disgusting.
1,ARRGGG!,"Dear God burn it, burn it! Holy Hell, i have no idea what these people did to these songs but they sound like crap. This is an aweful cd, it's just a collection of some of The Animals most well known songs, which have somehow been ""digitally remastered"" to grate on your eardrums. It's not even Eric Burdon and The Animals who sing the songs on the cd, it's some moron with a synthesizer. My God they should all be burned and sent back to Hell where they belong."
2,Results!,"I bought this from the beach body website but I wanted to leave a review here because reading these reviews is really what encouraged me to purchase. I just completed the 6 Day Supermodel Slimdown and I am impressed. I am 5'3 and overweight. In 6 days I have lost 3 pounds and 4.5"" total. I've lost a inch of my waist, an inch off my hips! I cannot wait to see what thirty days on this has to offer me! You will not be disappointed!"
1,Overated book,I probably had a huge expectation on the book as so many people talk really good things about it but the truth is I found it hard to go over some chapters and I really thing it is generally overated
1,One of the very worst of the series,"Neither scary nor fun. What a waste of my time. This is a pretty darn pitiful entry into the series. Probably one of the main reasons that Showtime did not pick it up for a third season. If you rent this, make sure it's cheap."
1,The Hatemonger speaks,"Mr. Peters is a rabid conservative partisan and known hatemonger who engages in peronsal insults. He is a disgrace to his country, and to the Miltary."
2,Very strong factual depictions,"I enjoyed this book for its factual & positive content regarding sea otters. If you are a lover of sea otter, Saving Sea Otters is probably a must. It's not fiction. It's not a compelling story per say, in terms of pure storytelling, but I found it very compelling to understand otters and the people who care for them. The photos are excellent. I'm glad I bought it but then again, I am an otter nut."
2,Excellent book!,I have read many books on this topic. It ismy favorite topic. However this is the first book I have read that actually touches on the fact that we are them and more importantly who Jesus really was. Many Christians would be shocked to read this but it is the ONLY story that makes any sense. Love this book!!!
2,Greener Grass,"A bank robber and a retired school teacher meet in a pharmacy.... It sounds like the set-up to a bad joke but is instead the opening to a fascinating and often charming study of two characters facing mortality who pause to consider what life would have been like if they had chosen different paths.These two paths meet at the aforementioned pharmacy and the two characters compare their differences each with a romanticized view of the role of their counterpart. In the short time they have before their mutual appointments with fate, they attempt to walk in each other's shoes (in one case literally) and each discover the secret of the other's world.The title of the film brings to mind the film ""Strangers on a Train"", perhaps intentionally, but here the two men are proposing to swap lives rather than deaths."
2,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!,I went and saw this movie trying to have an open mind sine i have never been to impresses with a lot of gay cinema... Man was i ecstatically surprised. I LOVED IT!!!!! I laughed... I cried... I was so glad i decided to add this to my San Francisco Pride festivities. I got to meet the director and a couple of the actors at the Loan Star and they are great great people. I just pre-ordered mine because this move was just amazing... The guys who made it did an amazing job and the actors were awesome... I wish I could be in the sequel.
1,Did not meet expectations,"I tried this product because I loved the grapefruit body wash from bath and body works but they discontinued it. I thought this would have a nice grapefruit scent, but it just smells exactly like plain dove soap. I really don't see how they can claim it smells like grapefruit when it doesn't at all. I was really disappointed and I will not be buying this product again."
1,Definitely Not Jason,"My friends brother got me absolutely hooked on Jason about a year ago. Waiting For My Rocket to Come, Jason's debut album, spent many weeks in my cd player and when I discovered Live At Java Joe's (by far Jason's best cd) I declared myself and avid Jason fan and was counting down to the release of Mr A-Z..So much so that we drove 35 minutes down the beach on vacation to get it the day it came out. This trip, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. Mr A-Z is completely different from the mellow, mainly acoustic stylings of Jason and encompasses many genres which Jason just doesn't work with. His voice is still amazing, and a few of the songs are highly addictive (ie. Wordplay) but the CD as a whole, if you like Jason and his style, in my opinion, bombs."
2,Good movie,"Cute movie, depicts somewhat of a realistic relationship. Fun to watch, would recommend to anyone who loves gay artist cinema!"
2,BEAUTIFUL - A TOUCH OF CLASS AT ITS BEST!!,"Andrea Bocelli is a legend in his time! Romanza is music from the Heavens that will linger in your heart and touch your soul forever - truly a masterpiece. After the trials and tribulations of the day, a warm bubblebath, a bottle of exquisite French wine and Romanza - what better way to soothe the savage soul. Bravo, Sr. Bocelli!!"
1,Not a pocket dictionary,"Just as a warning for persons purchasing a ""pocket"" dictionary for travel.This is not a dictionary that would fit into a ""pocket"" unless you had a backpack.It is 7 inches high, 4 inches long and 1.5 inches thick. It may not be a full size dictionary but this was too large to be kind of dictionary that I need to travel with me in my pocket.Other than the size, it appears to be a good product."
2,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I enjoyed Where the Red Fern Grows because of the courage,glory,and love that Little Ann and Old Dan gave to Billy.Wilson Rawls is a great writer and keeps me on the tip of my seat the whole time I was reading it.If you want to know more about the book,read it and you'll never forget this book.(#16)"
2,Diaper Champ,It is simpler than I thought it would be. No diaper sausage like with the diaper genie. We use scented bags to curb the smell a little extra. I would definitey recommend it to anyone.
1,Thank goodness for the extended warranty!,"I purchased this at Target in July, 2007. Because we have had trouble with various electronic gadgets, we decided to buy the extended warranty (3 years for $19). Good thing we did. This unit was purchased for our longer road trips. It really didn't have that many hours on it. Unfortunately, it failed on our recent 800 mile road trip. This was only 5 months after purchase. The kids were upset, as that was their main form of entertainment for the long ride. Since they were unhappy, we were all miserable (you know how that goes!). I have contacted the Service Plan people and they will be sending me a credit for the amount paid once they receive the broken unit from me. It is unlikely I will purchase this Disney unit again. However, based on our track record, it seems like unless you're willing to pay good money for top brand electronics, none of them last very long."
1,Laguna max-flo 800,"Yes, I said 800. You can't find the 800 series of this pump? All you have to do is order the 900, the 800 is hidden in the box. Too bad there wasn't room for the 900 too.Hagen says it's 900 GPH, the sellers say it's 900 GPH, but the pump says it's 800GPH."
2,lets compare...,the 4x memory card is way better.the reason i gave it 4 stars is because of mamory capacities. the vmu has very litle memory. if you only have 3 or less games this is good for you. but if your planing on getting more games or have a lot already get the 4x.the good things about the vmu is that you can play mini games like with chao on sonic adventure 2 you can view and erase files on the litle screen but the bateries get sucked really fast! you can also conect 2 vmu's to play head to head. for shenmue the vmu shows you what buttons to push on the screen if your learning a new move.
1,expedited shipping was a joke,"my issue is not with the product. the peel off strip was half off so it looked at first as if it were used, but it ended up being new thank goodness. my main compalaint is with the shipping. i paid for expedited shipping the morning of tues. 9/11/12 the estimated arrival was either 9/13 to 9/14. it did not arrive until monday 9/17/12. i would not have paid for the extra amount if i had known that it would be late. and i missed my first assignment which was due sunday nite for class because i was not able to start without student kit. i am not sure if i will buy a book from this seller again, if i do it will be when there is no deadline for anything."
1,Not performed by Burt Bacharach!,"Unfortunately I purchased this album believing that it was performed by Burt Bacharach. And not. I suggest to advert more clearly to the customers of it, to avoid dissatisfaction."
2,decent stick,"I had the rumble version of this stick for a few weeks, liked it and decided to upgrade to this force feedback stick. It works well, but seems to have a difficult time autocentering. This makes it difficult for use with flight sims and such.If you follow the directions, you should have no problems installing the drivers. But, as others have said, don't expect to call an 800 number and get help."
1,Not Reccomended,The cooling pad is very loud.The supporting lever is not doing the job. The little hole for the cord retracted and disappeared.I do not recommend this product at all.
2,Nice cage with a lot of extras,"I bought this cage to house a parakeet. The packaging stated that it was for a cockatiel although I would NOT house a cockatiel in this cage. I cockatiel needs a cage at least twice the size of this one. Although slightly smaller than most parakeet recommendations, I feel this cage is large enough for 1 bird. The extras that came with this cage were great even though cheaply made. The cage is not the highest quality but for the price and the items included it is a real good deal."
1,Break quickly,I bought two of these. One of them was the model with vibration and the other without. Both of them lost the ability to recharge their battery packs making them no longer usable as wireless controllers and even when they are wired they still can lose their connection. I emailed Nyko customer service about this and I never received any response. Not only that but the other Nyko product I bought also broke with light use in just 2 months. Stay away from these even if they are on sale for cheap.
2,Sasha works his magic again!!,"Sasha's new albums is exactly what i expected it to be, melodic, deep, uplifting and irie at the same time. As sasha said himself...this album is not for the newcomers or for the hard party people...this one is for real sasha fans who understand what his music is all about...its not about how mmuch u can jump and dance to this album..its really about what u can experience through it...where can u go on this trip...the more u listen to it...the more u understand it..its a life long adventureTo really appreciate this album.. one needs to be into music for another reason... This is a trip that i will never forget... sasha manages to take u everywhere in this journey... melodic breaks and smooth uplifting symphonies bring to mind the peaceful and serene atmosphere of mountain raves...where its just u and nature...and the music..so take of ur shoes...get comfortable and relax...cause u dont know where ur gonna end up this time..."
2,Great for one-sided decorating,"The bowl would be great for displaying Christmas balls or something similar on a side table. The only odd thing is that the snowflakes are only on one side of the piece, not the whole way around."
1,PLEASE BEWARE!!!,"You have no warraranty on this product if you purchase through Amazon. Usually, that would not be a big deal, but chances are you will have problems. Ours is shooting sparks after a year and a half. After reading the reviews on Folica's site, this is not uncommon. It's a lot of money to spend for that length of time.Also note, if you do buy from an authorized dealer on T3's short list, it has to be registered within 21 days of purchase to be valid.It is quiet and light, but others will give better performance."
1,HEY AMAZON! THIS IS A COMPLETELY FAKE CHINESE COUNTERFEIT,This is NOT the Artisan Release. They NEVER made a 2 Disc Version. The DVD will soon be availiable as a Criterion release. This is a COUNTERFEITED CHINESE DVD. China does not manufacture any legitimate Region 1 DVDs. Any R1 from China & Korea are BOOTLEG/COUNTERFEITS! AMAZON: remove these illegal fakes! Why does Amazon allpw Counterfeits?
1,"Makes things shiny, but doesn't really remove tarnish.","Purchased this to remove tarnish from my brass wood burning stove door. It made the brass shiny, but really didn't remove much tarnish. This is one of the few things I have returned to Amazon."
1,Even MST3K can't save the day.,"Far be it for me to knock MST3K, but even they can't make this garbage watchable. Honestly, there's just nothing there to work with. As already described, the film for whatever reason, eschews actual dialogue in favor of toneless narration, and the pace of the movie matches the monster: it creeps at you. Now, the boys on the Satelite of Love can do ok with plot wholes, bad acting, bad directing, etc., but they're at their best when they rip on the cruddy dialogue found in the films they watch. Without that, most of the jokes seem forced, or just aren't as clever as they should be. I can't even think of one really great line from Mike (or Joel) and the robots as I can in other episodes. The numerous flaws make ""The Creeping Terror"" unbearable to watch on its own. But those same flaws make it an unmockable film, even by the experts. Skip this one, and get ""Eegah!"" or ""Pod People"" instead."
2,Definitely fun,"Cute, cute, cute.... How can anyone resist him? This was not a ""deep"" movie but it was still great, of course Heath was adorable. Julia Stiles' character was a riot. Good movie to laugh with!"
1,Ignore the review from Robert C Taylor,My copy is packed with essential information on purchase and body restoration. I have bought and restored two MGBs using this guide and in both cases got slightly better than I was expecting. Can't speak the the later issue entitled 'MGB Restoration Manual' but have been assured by others that it contains more or less the same information. It is an *essential* resource for anyone contemplating buying an MGB.
2,"Fast, fun read","For a debut novel, I found this book to be very enjoyable. Can't wait for the next one."
1,DISAPPOINTING STERNS LIFE VESTS,"I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH THE RETURN POLICY. THE VEST WAS ADVERTIZED AS ADULT SIZE BUT WAS SO SMALL AS TO FIT ONLY A MID TEEN. THE STRAPS WERE SMALL . THE SNAPS WERE SMALL AND HARD TO WORK. THIS IS A SUBSTANDARD PRODUCT COMPARED TO STERNS PRODUCTS I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST. THE OVERALL RETURN POLICY AT AMAZON (GILROY'S) LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. I HAD TO E-MAIL FOR A RETURN AUTHORIZATION NUMBER, BUY A BOX, PAY POSTAGE, AND PAY A RESTOCKING FEE. IN TOTAL IT COST ME ABOUT 25% OF THE PRODUCT COST ( $71 ) TO RETURN IT. THAT WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND MY VISA HAS STILL NOT BEEN CREDITED WITH MY REFUND YET. I WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM AMAZON THAT HAS THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY ON NEEDING TO BE RETURNED. OTHERS, TAKE NOTE!"
2,AWESOME,"I've just gotten this game and it is awesome. what the most cool thing about it is you're not in the ring. you can choose to be in a train station, burning warehouse, ect. Right now my favorite fighters are ludacris, bubba sparxxx, and proffesional break dancer crazy legs. i recommend it to all people who like fighting games!"
2,Emperor 400 filter,This filter works great. It was a little on the noisy when I first started it up. After about a week it got quiet. Be sure to buy the correct filters.
2,best playpen ever!,"this is one of the best most practical porducts i have bought for my kids. i wish i would have bought it when my first one was born! we took it camping and my son slept in it in our tent trailer, as well as for naps down on the beach. the toys in it allowed him to play while he layed there and then would fall asleep! the square design gives more room to play when he can't be on the ground! just perfect! love it love it love it!"
1,Tallchief: The Homecoming,"I was very disappointed in this book. I usually always love Cait London novels, but this one is the exception. I tried to keep reading this book, but I just had to give it up. I really didn't like Michelle at all. I'm very disappointed to say that I just had to give up three parts through the book. Just couldn't get interested. Liam was lovely but why the heroine had to be like she was, I don't understand. Awful!"
2,"Not your ""typical"" 10,000 maniacs: a documentary","As someone who had his teen years in the eighties, I was gladly surprised to have heard this album which depicts the first recordings by the band at the beginning of that decade. There's a blend of styles that range from reggae to ska and new wave, that show where Natalie Merchant and company came from. Filled with an innocent flavor that makes it all the more attractive, not your ""typical"" 10,000 Maniacs album, yet an extraordinary documentary on the band's original work."
1,Overpriced and uncomfortable,I would not recommend this lapdesk if it's comfort and convenience you're looking for. The attachable mouse-pad is a nuisance and the mouse tends to slide off. The bottom of the lapdesk is bulky and lays uncomfortably on your lap. For what you get I feel it's overpriced and not very convenient.
1,Cute little item.,"Be careful about your purchase. The one we acquired was a miniture version. The type was ok and you could read it, but the book was about 2"" x 3"". It was a miniture and not at all what we thought we were acquiring. We wanted the whole book. When ordering we did not notice that it was a miniture edition."
1,Cliche,"This was an extremely cliche movie about a killer (Tom Cruise) who forced his cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to become his designated driver for the evening so he could kill people. The movie was so terribly cliche that for about twenty minutes of it, I got up and dusted and vacuumed with the movie still going. I added a new vacuum bag, came back, and the movie was still as boring as it had been for the past 45 minutes. The only interesting parts were when Jada Pinkett came in."
2,"Looks great, but dirty","I was looking for short fencing to go around my perenial garden, I needed 60 feet, so I ordered 3 rolls. This works perfect and looks great. The only thing, was that the rolls and box were very dusty and dirty, next time they might want to wipe them off before they're shipped."
2,Great sound...YES.....great value? NO,"I bought these for my GF to use on her recent trip to China. She loves them on the plane. Once she got home, I had a chance to 'test' them out. I tried mowing the lawn with them tonight and here is what I found:Pros:Great noise cancellation. That's a no brainer. they are built for itSounds great...trebble..bass...all thereComfortable and lightCons:Only two volume selection: high and low. I had the Ipod volume on max and it didn't seem that loud.Sweaty ears. Man did I sweat after taking them off. It wasn't that hot outside either. You'll get sweat all around the ear piece. I don't know if that's leather or vinyl.Flimsy cord-the cord is very small. I was afraid I might get tangle while mowing and pull the wires apart. I wish it could slightly thicker.OVerall a great sounding headset. I wished I had more time to research different brands before settling on the Bose. She is my princess and deserves the best!!!"
1,Disappointment guaranteed for old and new M:tA Players,"I have been a long-time player of Mage: The Ascension, and this version was a major let-down. First of all, there are new rules concerning Avatar Winds, a bogus idea that makes crossing the gauntlet harder for magi. Second, the traditions are now almost the same, only varying in their beliefs and specialty spheres. In the old version, Cultists of Ecstasy got all level 1 spheres as always active, but no more. They also cut out a lot of information concerning talismans, sanctums, familiars, and such. I will admit that the rules have been clarified, and that they made Paradox a greater threat, but they did not bring back the rotes list like I wished they would, and only barely even mention that rotes exist. In all, I'd say to go for the second-edition if you can get your hands on it. It is a much better version."
1,"Sadly, only mediocre","The premise of the book definitely has potential to be intriguing, enticing, and unusual, but the potential is just never fully realized. Two separate plots are loosely joined in the novel--the search for demonic books and the answers therein and the half-hearted muddling about a Dumas manuscript--and neither is fully fleshed out. Some of the plot twists are simply silly and the eventual denouments (two, one for each of the plots) are by turns ridiculous and boring. The main character is intriguing, but around him are assembled cardboard cut-outs of characters. Not a terrible novel, but just so much less than it could be. A shame. I was convinced to buy the book solely by the book cover promise that it was a cross between The Name of the Rose and The Three Musketeers--it is, resoundingly, not even close. Rather than buy this book, read (or re-read) either of those other two--it will be a much more satisfying investment of time."
2,Laughed hard and loud!,I just want to say that Margaret Cho is one of the funniest people I've ever seen.Notorious C.H.O. was filmed in Seattle and the show was just fantastic! She's raunchy and sexy and isn't afraid to talk about ANYTHING!The best was the midget lesbian... oh so funny! People should really check her out!
1,Ultimate Rip Off (LOGO) SMK,"This game is just another version of MK3. It has some new characters that I like, like Ermac and the old sub-zero.It is very crummy and should be bought for the sega saturn. Wouldn't buy if I were you. If you would like to know if i have any other reviews just look for my logo which is SMK that should be at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK"
1,ULTIMATE FAMILY TREE PLATINIUM,"DO NOT BUY. BEING SOLD UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. THIS PRODUCT WAS SUPERB IN ITS DAY BUT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY INTERNET DOWNLOADS OR THE MANUFACTURER. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP HOME ADDITION. NOTE THAT AMAZON.COM ADS DO NOT TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH (WINDOWS 95, 98). IN MID AUGUST 2003 I PURCHASED THIS ""PIG IN A POKE"". I HAVE USED UFT SINCE 1997. I SPENT HOURS CONTACTING THE THREE COMPANIES THAT, STARTING WITH UFT 2.0, THEN 3.0 HAVE OWNED THIS SOFTWARE."
1,READ B4 U BUY!!!!,This is not a PC to TV cable. If u want to use it for that do not buy this!!! It will not work.
2,Love it except..........,"Brad Paisley is one of the best artist to come along in a long while. However, I wish the record company would quit making us buy a CD 3-4 times so we can get the ""bonus cuts"" or atleast make the bonus cuts available as a download. Brad will be around for hits to come!"
2,it's a long-distance runner,"I bought this lamp in about 1993, used it for editing (all day, every day) until I retired in 2007, and have used it for at least a few hours daily in the five years since then. It just now gave up the ghost, and I'd say it doesn't owe me anything after 19 years. I'm ordering a new one.I don't recall ever changing the bulb, either, so that too is a long-distance runner."
2,"3 misfits, 2 powerful wizards, 1 fantastic adventure!!!!","Ms. Huff's characters are some of the most ragtag and troubled that I've ever encoutered. Still, they come across as people you can empathize with, rather than pity. You cheer them on as they try to tackle the problems of an entire nation while managing their own shortcomings and hang-ups...and there are plenty! A prince, a thief, and a young wizard seek the magic talisman that holds back the everpresent peril threatening the city. At the same time, each grows and matures, forming bonds of friendship and love to last forever."
2,"Another Nancy Meyers' Gem, Simply Charming","This is the best romantic comedy I have seen this year. It has all the great elements of a truly amazing ""chick"" flick. Humor, romance, solid likable characters, foreign locations, etc. make it so great. Cameron Diaz is at her bubbly best, Kate Winslet is so charming, Jude Law is terrific, and my fave Jack Black shows his range at being utterly charming and adorable. This is such a simple film compared to the effect block busters like Eragon, etc. that it made more of an impact with me, because of the character development and solid storyline. Go Out, Watch this film and ENJOY!"
1,Meandering and disjointed,"Ms. Hancox is all over the place, jumping from brief bios of Elizabethan figures to snippets about zoroastrianism, the Kabbalah, mathematics and alchemy. I think this hodge-podge of a text is somehow supposed to support an opaque theory of hers that ties together Elizabethan theatres, magic and aristocracy in a kind of vaguely-defined mystical knot. When she's not deviating wildly from this bumpy train of thought, she's lambasting the builders of the Globe reconstruction for not listening to her advice (whatever that is) about the design of their theatre. To give her the benefit of the doubt, since she also keeps coming back to the topic of cryptography, it is possible that the entire manuscript of her book is, in fact, a coded message to aliens."
1,"Oh, No, Not At All.","Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands of the 70's. They only made 1 decent song in Stairway To Heaven, which deserves 2 stars.I can't believe the top sellers of the world are Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles as they all suck. Even Appetite forDestruction by Guns N' Roses is better than this. Go get that.That rocks, this sucks!! Throw is in your trash can immediately."
1,I liked my textbook better,I am also a student at BU and personally I found our textbook to be a little more helpful. Maybe that's why I am getting a B+ in our class and doofus boy below is getting a C. Ha ha!I doubt very much that the author of this book could even pass a college course with as little as he knows about the business side of PR. I don't think this book was written with any target audience in mind because it just kind of jumps all over the place. Maybe its good reading for schizos. Or people with ADD.
2,Scarf Review,"Pretty good, but this scarf is itchy and a lot wider than I thought it would be. It's not really practical for every-day use, but for a costume piece this is good. The emblem is just a patch, so if you find a striped scarf and can buy a Slytherin patch for less money, I would recommend that instead. But this is a cute scarf if that's something that you're interested in."
1,Many bugs!!!! Will just crash.,"Attempted to complete my tax return. Got to an entry from a K-1, put in the amount, and whamo.....whole system just crashed. When I sent the error report Microsoft, they said there was no fix. So I called Tax Cut. Sure enough, there is no fix and if you have to enter an amount on this line of the Federal return, you can't use this software!!!!! How can they put out a product that they know doesn't work???? BTW, when the system crashed, it lost entirely the return I was working on. Don't buy this."
2,simply the best chile,"I have been a fan of randy crawford since i was 14 yrs ago and maybe by the time this post i will be 31.This was an amazing cd,I had to get use the sound......but once you do.....you're captured!Thank you randi randee randy"
2,Nice addition,Purchased for a kid's room that is jungle themed...Looks realistic enough...adds a noticeable touch to the top of the jungle hut
1,Best of Grant Green,"Although this book covers quite a few of Grant Green's work, It primarily only covers the solos. Instead the chords are only listed and not charted. From my experience there are several chord voicings to choose from and it takes a lot of time to look at the solos and find the correct voicings. I have purchased Hal leonard products in the past and they were much more comprehensive.This is a good book if you just want a little insight into Grants Greens music. But an authentic recorded version of some of his better works would be much better."
2,Another great book in the series,My 10 year old son has enjoyed all the books in the Harriet the Spy series.
1,"Ok, but SBM-200 is better","This massager is alright, I bought it prior to buying a Homedics SBM-200. I find that the stationary massage points leave much to be desired. For double the money you get a much better massage with the SBM-200 since it moves up and down your back."
1,Very tinny sound,"I bought this to replace a 40+ year old Panasonic AM transister radio that I've listened to every morning for many many years, but it died recently. Of old age, I assume. I've always trusted Sony to make quality products so I didn't hesitate to buy this radio when I saw it was made by Sony. The sound quality is pretty bad - very tinny, much worse than my old radio. I can't hardly stand to listen to it in the morning, it is irritating at best. I only use it for the AM news - can't imagine how FM music must sound on it and don't want to find out. As soon as I can find another one that is small enough and battery operated, I'll donate this Sony to Goodwill. Very disappointed."
2,"Great item, but a bit pricey",Like my tittle say this is a great item but it is rather expensive for the amount of bags you get. But the Quality is great! This is a must have when camping!
1,Not so good,"Puff Daddy left Harlem at age 12, but for some reason he seems to think he is a hardcore gangbanger. Despite being a millionaire through brilliantly over sampling other artists' work, he still manages to convey a thug impression to the greater percentage of his fans. Fortunately for those of us who truly understand hip hop and rap music in general, he shares his fans with the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, and other preteen appealing groups that otherwise have no influence on hip hop culture, as well as a few misguided others who attempt to have 'east side' pride by supporting someone so an object of scorn by those from the 'west side'. But wherever you fall, Puff Daddy's annoying, high-pitched and repetetive whining in no way exemplifies rap or even hip hop, and he can't even write his own lyrics; that's why he replaced B.I.G. with Mase as his writer and rips off Faith Evans AND Sting in one song. (that's his only talent)"
2,Wonderful and Beautiful,"Wonderful, Beautiful, and Talented can only describe Wendy Colonna. Right Where I Belong is a wonderful album that you can listen to over and over. Thank you Wendy for such beautiful music."
2,GREAT GROOVES!!!!! I'M DANCING!,"I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos!"
1,A disappointment!,"I ordered this video for my daughter, age 2, after she showed an interest in the alphabet and numbers. The fact that this was a Parent's Choice led me to believe that it would be the perfect educational video. Was I wrong! The 2 songs that deal with the ABC's go by so fast that my daughter couldn't keep up. Don't even expect that this video will help you child learn numbers. The first counting song only repeated ""1-2-3"" over and over and the second just showed a little girl randomly counting to 5, 6, 7, and 8. The songs didn't even keep my daughters interest. All the video contains are songs that are boring to a 2 year old and seem like they would be trivial to a 5 year old."
1,Nice Neutral Color,"That's all it has on the plus side.This thing is useless: the slightest breeze blows it away from the windshield and, if there is no breeze, the frost forms underneath it. You might as well just throw a blanket over your windshield."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap...",This device has the durability and quality of a preschool construction project as it broke within the first 3 minutes...no joke. Much better off just getting the Samsung headphones which are made specifically for the Blackjack. They actually work very well.
1,"Amateurish, typical","This books seemed to me to be written very amateurishly. It read like a conversation with a friend, unfortunately its content seemed only about that reliable. While the author starts out talking about sleep functions, etc., she then moves on to give gobs of tangentally-related parenting advice...my point being that this ""info"" was merely opinion, and an unprofessional-sounding one at that. She didn't back up what she said in a substantial way, and I found that in fact, she didn't offer any real solutions to people in dire need of a sleeping child. At best this book offers guidelines that would be good to keep in mind before a baby is born, and a bit of info on infant sleep patterns."
1,Good food basics,"If you haven't yet learned that sodas and sugar are bad for you, and more veggies are good, then hey, this is the book for you. While Rubin makes some excellent points, such as WHOLE honey having minerals and enzymes that can be lost in the heating process to refine it, he fails to point out the dangers of honey to pregnant women and small children. This may not sound like much, but then consider how many other things he may be failing to tell you about, or over emphasizing.Overall, the book is fine, with a few interesting recipes and discussion on how your lymph system works and how to best manage your intestinal health. However, I could have happily done WITHOUT him constantly pushing his company, his products, and the products of his friends (from whom I'm sure he gets a nice little kick-back). Take it all with a grain of salt, and it's fine, but frankly there are better books to read, such as Nourishing Traditions, Wild Fermentation, and Raw Food; Real World."
2,Tree Girl,I think that this is a good book for teenagers. It had a lot of good points. It shows a lot about real life. It tells a story about a little girl that has lost he family. and has to make it on her own.
2,Very funny...,this book is hysterical. we found it one night while on a dig in scotland and it passed the time at night very nicely. full of jokes about field workers and interesting shirt slogans. great to bring if your going to be with new people to break the ice
2,Help,"This CD is wonderful but I need to know what song was played on General HOspital on Friday, August 30- It was played at the very end on the show."
1,Dated and disturbing,"Emotional abuse, Racism, Emotional incest, Religious bigotism and just plain cruelty. NOT a book I enjoyed reading and I would certainly not give it to a child to read."
2,A beautifully human story with a timeless message in the search for peace,"A beautifully told tale and human account of the search and journey towards peace. I have read many books and teachings that point towards truth, to reaching full realization. I found this book in its novel form to be an enjoyable change from the 'heavier' content i so often read, yet its message, captivating and easy read in its story form, is full of depth and meaning. A wonderfully told story with an accessible, meaningful message."
1,Beware,I was fairly happy with the unit until it refused to copy files from my Kingston Elite Pro (50x) SD card. Their tech support blamed the card that it used outdated technology and I needed 80x or faster card. They should probably put correct information on their product page about which cards actually work with this unit. I do not appreciate being misled.
2,Arrived just as advertised,"I wear these under my body armor at work...not as comfy as some others, but I like the instant identification should I have to take off my uniform top in the field for some reason."
2,21 JUMP STREET!,21 jump street was my favorite TV series in my childhood..and I became Johnn Depp fan since 21 jump street...*_*....With this DVD my Johnny Depp collection is complete!! ^.^....Hope all seasons will release soon!!
2,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"Sure, it's early Hollywood - Maureen O'Hara's hair remains perfectly styled even after she is tortured - but the film remains for me as fresh and wonderful as when I first saw it in the 1930s."
1,Terrible waste of time...,"The only reason I watched the entire movie is because as a rule, I never leave a book or a movie unfinished. This one REALLY tempted me to break my rule... thats how bad it is. Rather than for prime-time viewing, this movie seems like it was scripted by, directed by, and made for 12 year olds. It looks and feels highly juvenile, immature, and really really stupid. I could trash this movie for hours, but I'll just leave it at this. I'm surprised so many people liked this movie, so go ahead try your luck.. maybe you'll like it too, but (as another reviewer pointed) if you dont like B-schlock movies, stay away.. stay FAR away... you have been warned... :-)"
2,Deals with a serious subject in an entertaining way.,Back in the Daze is an entertaining book that deals with drug addiction. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with a drug addiction.
1,Not what I was expecting,"I have to start by saying I am not an avid Anne Rice reader, with that in mind I bought this series of books based on a friends recommendation. We are almost no longer friends over this series. The book is literally nothing but continuous rape and subjugation. I forced myself to finish the book on the hope that it would improve but at no time did I ever see a plot. The book started with the raping of beauty to wake her, then the prince took possession of her and used her as his play thing through the whole book. It really is disgusting, and now I have two other books in the series that I refuse to read. My stomach just can't take that amount of crudity and cruelty.On a personal note, if you somehow have found joy or interest in this book there is really something wrong with you. The girl is 16 being raped day in and day out. I'm shocked a publisher even took a chance on this series...."
2,Cell phone...,"I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com"
1,Terrible Aspirator,"From the pic I thought it would be like the one from the hospital, but it isn't. It is much smaller and has no suction."
2,Traveler,Like it very much. Just be careful not to make turns too sharp. I wound up watering my neighbor's lawn because traveler didn't make the turn. Like the ease of adjustment both in angle of spray and volume of spray via faucet adjust.
2,"Beautiful, Peaceful Example of Living in the Moment!","This is one of the most beautiful movies I have watched. It is simple and the photography is breathtaking. Kate Winslet speaks gently over the beautiful scenery and the Fox and the Child. I have recommended this movie to a lot of people. The amazing insight into the world of the Fox is beautiful and the gentleness of the Child is clearly shown. I love this movie. If you are looking for an example of ""Living in the Moment"" this movie is perfect. If you just want to feel good - this movie is perfect! Enjoy!!! Over and Over and Over again"
1,Doesn't fit the 2011 Subaru Outback,I just tried to install this filter in the 2011 Subaru Outback Limited PZEV and it does not fit. It is a hair to big and the clips will not close if you put this filter in.
1,broken and doesn't play any music,the accordion arrived with a piece floating around inside. we tried to fix it but we could hardly get a sound out of it. we returned it!
2,Great music!,You can never go wrong with James Blunt! Great heart felt music. Easy listening. I would buy this cd 1000xs !!!!
2,one of the BEST GAMES!,"this game really is a sequel to the oringanal Kingdom Hearts,my ratings, graphics 5 stars, difficulty: medium,funess 4 and a half, you should get this game and its a great starter for the sequel Kingdom Hearts 2."
1,Offering a reprint of titles not even 2 years old,"The stories by both authors are wonderful, I am a devoted fan of McNaught. I just find it upsetting - and a easy way to mislead people into spending money on something they've already read - to reprint stories that appeared one or maximum two years ago under a new title and cover. Anyone not careful is just going to see the new title and the authors names and will buy to be disappointed afterwards. I really don't like this approach - so I'm rating that and not the content which is very good."
1,Buy a Capresso,"This stopped working for me after a few months. And while it was working, I was unimpressed. My roommate had a capresso burr grinder, and when he moved out, I thought i'd save some money and buy the cuisinart. Waste of money. First of all, it just doesn't grind quite as finely as I would like for espresso. Second, it is a freaking mess and really hard to use without getting grinds all over the place. Third, the grounds are not all of a consistent size.All in all, I ended up buying a capresso after all and I am pleased."
1,doesn't compare to original,doesn't smell like the original heaven scent nor does it stay with you..sent disappears after a while. Have to reapply
2,Great product at a great price!,"I bought 2 sets of these hubcaps to put on my 15"" winter tires/steel wheels. These snapped on snug and have not come off in the few weeks that I have been using them so far. I wanted something that had a similar look to the stock Chevy Cobalt wheels and these fit the bill."
1,hmmmm........,"do you get the impression that all these 5 star reviews are sorta the same? they all say the same-o-same-o. this game sucks cuz the graphics are the worst of any final fantasy game EVER. the hero looks so lame, i wish he had just got blown up or somting. overall a F-."
1,worst Hellblazer read so far,"This is the worst Hellblazer I read so far.It is disappointing because I read two other volumes written by the same author ---Garth Ennis--- (Dangerous habits and Fear & loathing) and both were very good. Unfortunately Son of Man is written like a parody: as if the author tried to ridicule its own work. The attempts at humour are lame (e.g. a demon insults Constantine's by telling him that his dad is sucking c**** in hell. To which Constantine replies ""does he swallow?""....umm, really? I stopped this kind of jokes when I turned 16.)Despite these lame moments, the story itself is interesting. However the art is of poor quality. Especially if you compare with the runs illustrated by Leonardo Manco.I regret spending money on this graphic novel..."
2,Love It!,"The first time I watched this I immediately fell in love with it.It's crazy, funny, random and adventurous.May not be better than the first but it DOES break from the story.The characters even talk about it during the beginning.And how can you not love Feldman and Haim playing Bobby and Dinger!Even though ""Bobby""(Feldman) is more mature in this one he is still funny.As for ""Dinger""(Haim)...he didn't change much at all.Still cute and hilarious.If you have a Corey's Collection this is defiantly must have."
2,Awesome,The Kratt brothers were great. You really get to know the types of animals they meet and the way they get so close to the animals is awesome. This is a great DVD.
2,Amazon needs more than a 5 Star rating system for this one.,"For some reason, this album has been compared to Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" since its release three, four years ago. I don't know why - except maybe for the fact that Nirvana's was the best secular rock album ever, and dc Talk's was the best Christian album ever? I'm not sure about Nirvana's album being the greatest ever, but ""Jesus Freak"" is by far the best Christian rock album ever released, and probably will be. The band strayed from their traditional hip-hop/rap and turned to a rock/alternative beat. Uh, the change was incredibly good. I never get tired of listening to this album; it's greatness never ceases to amaze me. Musically, awesome - though, probably not as good as ""Nevermind's"", but close. Lyrically, much better than Nirvana. Buy it, you won't regret it. A spectacular album with spectacular songs that should be played on secular radio stations nation-wide."
1,Not what I thought I was buying,"I was looking for wooden puzzles like Melissa and Doug puzzles that are nice and stable. These puzzle pieces are flimsy and everytime my son lays a piece, the whole puzzle breaks apart. Wish the pieces were a little bigger or more heavier so the other pieces wouldn't fall apart."
2,"Fresh, upbeat tracks!","PYT's debut album consists of upbeat, radio-playable hits, one right after the other! Highly recomended to fans of Britney Spears and Mandy Moore."
1,Skip It - Better Books Are Available,"A previous reviewer mentioned giving away 500 copies of this book. If that is accurate then it begs the question ""Why this book?"" Because it fills a void? This book IS a void! The author obviously hasn't bothered to keep the book updated since its original publishing date of 1996 and it shows. There is a substantial gap of knowledge present in this book and the reader is advised to seek a more modern discussion of the topics. An excellent alternative is 'The Prostatitis Manual: A Practical Guide to Management of Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome'. A bit more expensive, but it leaves 'The Prostatitis Syndromes' in the mists of time where it belongs. You get what you pay for."
2,Most excellent!,"This experience of sale was like the movie said ""tonight forever they will remember the Titans."""
2,Hot Southern Nights,"This book is really different. Revenge, lust, love, murder, time travel, a shape-shifting devil's minion villain (oh, what a wicked, vile, evil creature!), and a romance that transcends time. This is a book that stays with you long after you close it. Whew! One of the greatest ever."
1,this book made me cry,I had originally bought this with two other books.The other two being Meg and The Trench.I read this book first and it was just a disgrace to the shark itself.Besides switching scenes every other sentence the author treated the shark as nothing but a soulless beast. i read up to the last five pages and couldnt bring myself to even finish the book because it was so bad. Stick with Steve Alten
1,"Anymore shallow, i'd be a cheerleader","I have never read a more racist, dismal and irrational response to the question of gender. Connell goes on (and on) about the symptoms of the problem without actually addressing the cause. Much word over nothing, me thinks."
2,The game,"While a very fun game it is a bit repeatative, and hard right off the bat. I just got a x box 360 so I haven't really played much of this game"
2,solid blender,"Good, solid piece of equipment. Easy to operate and clean. Makes great smoothies and is the right shape and size for making mayonaise, etc... Not flimsy"
2,Gene Kelly does fancy footwork of the swashbuckling kind,"Wow!!! All of the swordfighting scenes were EXCELLENT. Gene was incredible with the sword, the fancy footwork, the gymnastics, the use of props in these scenes, etc. There was absolutely NO LOOKING AWAY from the screen when he was doing his swordplay. I want to watch this again soon - that first swordfighting scene must have been nearly as long as the famous swordfighting scene in 'Scaramouche', and every bit as good, possibly better. I was truly amazed.It was just a really good movie, and the four actors portraying the Musketeers had great chemistry together, especially Gene & Van Heflin. The sets were okay, the costumes were very good, the acting was great, and in some cases, such as with Vincent Price, outstanding. But the swordfighting is THE thing I will remember most about this movie when all is said & done.1-10 scale, I'd give the movie a 9.0-9.5, but the swordplay scenes a 10+."
1,Not My First Choice for Fondant,"Actually, Wilton fondant isn't even my 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choice. I have used this fondant for covering cake boards and for figures that will not be consumed, but I would never use this fondant to cover a cake that was going to be eaten as I find the taste of Wilton fondant to be disgusting. There are far too many other brands of fondant out there that are superior in both taste and ease of use to settle for using Wilton fondant."
1,Don't be fooled by the cover...,"This is the worst movie to ever be made in the history of movies. However, if you like softcore porn, you may actually enjoy this because that is about all there is to it. I would have to say there is more plot in porn movies than this movie. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. After you watch it, you don't know whether to laugh or cry that you actually spent the money on it. I have seen some really bad movies but this has to be the worst. No joke... However, if you don't heed my advice and you do buy this movie you can always use the disc as a frisbee for your dog or a coaster to put your drinks on. Personally, I'd set it on fire and see how fast it burns. That would be more entertaining than what this film had to offer."
2,"It is a good item, just not that useful...","I liked it and works fine, as expected. Just I still cannot understand when is better to use this instead of your fingers, not much difference. Maybe a lady with long nails or if you have any issue with your hand or fingers that prevent you from using them comfortably."
2,Eric Darius Shines,"I recently purchased the debut CD by Eric Darius, and it is great! I had the pleasure of being able to hear Eric play a few times in church in Sarasota, Florida before he was known, and loved his music immediately. He knows his way around the sax, and he is a hard worker when he performs. I hope he has a long and profitable career. You can't miss with this CD."
1,Headbands Cracked for Me Too,"I was given a pair of Logitech wireless headphone as a gift and loved using them with my iPod. The headband very quickly cracked and the whole headset stopped working. I loved all other features so much that I bought a second pair and tried to reinforce the headband with electrical tape right out of the box. This did not help as they headband on pair #2 cracked as well. Once cracked the wires stretch and break and the headphones then become worthless. Too bad, except for this flaw these are great headphones."
2,Good Read,This book was very good but very sad. I liked hearing the perspective of someone from that era. You really feel for all the characters. I really enjoyed it.
1,A need to EXCORCISE this move from the market...it's awful,"I thought the acting was very bad-many times downright corney. CORN RIGHT OFF THE COB. I was thinking to myself..you gotta be kidding. Not much plot to it, and it bored me to tears (yes I was bored so much it really made me yawn excessively producing tears from the yawning!). The excorcism itself was a big joke with more very very bad acting. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING-I honestly felt a teenager could have written a better script, and the acting I thought to be just as bad. I DID NOT LIKE OR ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL!I rented this movie and felt cheated out of my money. I can't imagine paying the full price for this loser. YAWN YAWN YAWN and corn--that was my exact feelings toward the movie.I wish there was a negative integer for ratings. I thought it didn't even deserve a ""one"""
1,Not what I thought it was,"Although as a teacher I appreciate the literature included, I was under the impression (from the title) that this book would have sections for children to read, and complimenting sections for parents to read. I bought it for my young readers, and it is basically a read aloud book."
1,Don't waste the money.,"As much as I love Sailor Moon, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! The picture that this page shows is actually from the live action version of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon called Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon. Moreover, this CD is of all the horrendous dubbed songs that helped butcher one of the best animes of the 90s. Lyrics are beyond corny. Don't waste the money. The Japanese songs are far superior."
2,"good visuals, but pretentious narration","This DVD is very good at giving the viewer a true sense of traveling on some of the finest trains in the world. Unlike some train travel vids, this one focuses as much on the train itself as it does on destination and sights en route. On lesser trains that might be tedious, but here it is very welcome. One drawback: everyone interviewed is falling over themselves to tell you how 'faaaabulous' the train is. By the third episode, I started mocking them in Monty Python voices. I checked the prices for these journeys on the internet and they are certainly pricey, so I can understand their desire to make them sound luxurious (which they are). But they lay it on way too thick. I found myself hitting the mute button whenever they paused to interview staff."
2,Easy to use and no cords,A can opener should be light and do the job right with ease and be easy and mobile and this thing does all of that and it's always fast and ready to use if you have it in the charger cradle all the time.Ergonomically it's very nice and make the job very simple for my wife so she loves it and I got one for my mom too!
1,Ehh...,"Im a huge fan of The Offspring but the cd just didnt do it for me. I loved their last 6 but this one is just... different. The lyrics are weird and the style is different. Im not saying that you will not like this CD but if you liked the other 6 you wont necessarilly enjoy this one. All in all, if you are a dedicated fan then you should still own this CD."
1,Written in OLD English!,"It became very boring! The story is told by several different people, making it alot to keep up with! I finally just quit reading,which is something I have really never done before!"
2,The most terrifying position on the B-17.,"This book will verify all the terrifying elements of the ball turret. It's impossible to imagine hanging in a sphere underneath the B-17, 5 miles up without a parachute, looking flack in the face and sweating at 40 degrees below zero. It even gets worse in a fighter attack when the gunner is moving up, down and around like a barrel going over Niagra Falls."
2,"Britian's answer to ""BOB Books""!","""Have a go"" is number 2b in a series (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.) which takes beginning readers slowly through the process of learning several new words in the context of everyday adventures. The stories are interesting, based on stories young kids can identify with, and beautifully illustrated. We've found the pace to be perfect -enough to keep a child interested, but not overwhelmed! They are not as silly as the Bob Book series, but seem a little more ""grownup"".I found this book and a few others in the ""Key Word Reading Scheme"" set in Toronto three years ago. My daughter is now starting to read and I'm very glad to have this book and the others in the series. For some reason they are almost impossible to find in the U.S., while other Ladybird Book series are available. We've loved all of them! Maybe Amazon could find a way to make the whole set available?"
2,The Anatomy Coloring Book,"It is a great product, and it has a high quality, also it is a great supplement for studying purposes."
1,Disappointing Toy! Buyer beware.,"I just gave this to my 7-year-old daughter for hanukkah. She was very excited as she loves to make up stories and draw. She immediately began playing with the toy and ended up in tears. The pens don't work well on the pages--the ink doesn't stick and the stickers don't adhere well so when you try to turn the page to work on another one, the stickers all fall off. We never even made it to the recording. It's going back to the store tomorrow."
1,Alarm DSL Filter: RJ31,"I ordered one RJ31 DSCL filter. The packing list stated the filter was one RJ31. However, item sent was the more common RJ45 for regular phone lines (different size). I already had RJ45's. Needed RJ31. Needed this item fast. VERY DISAPPOINTED that wrong product was delivered."
1,Kid Vengeance,"The movie has a good story; however, the quality of the DVD is not good. It looks like it was recorded from a bad VHS. I was disappointed that the seller does not inform the buyer that the DVD is not digitally remastered. Unless you like poor quality DVDs with no chapter list, do not waste your money on this DVD."
2,BRING THIS TO DVD NOW!!!!,I either have to stay up until 0300 to watch this during the week on A&E or hold out to see it on Friday. Just hurry up and release the DVDs already!!! The show is brilliant! If I could buy all 6 seasons on DVD it would be the only box set I could justify spending $200+ to get.
1,Rap Music's worst moment...,"run-dmc was mixing rock with rap almost twenty years ago, and did a great job with it, so when i hear bands like korn and limp bizkit ape the style, i just yawn...crazy town brings nothing new to the table...same old song, same old insanity, simply tired lyrics...this is one of the reasons why i dont buy much new music now..a lot of artists aren't making music that's real and from the heart...they just care about demographics...but that's what you get when suits in the music biz can't tap their feet...cd's like these only make good frisbees....avoid..."
1,fair warning-for ages between 5 and 12.,"I buy anything with promising females on cover so this is how flick ended in my collection. One visible future in this eahh.. for kids is excessive violence mostly by females aganst males, well, as long as it balanced with something sinister I dont mind but it exactly what was avoided at all cost--any hint on sexuality. When watching I asked myself numerous times--Ok, chicks look sexy whats next. Next never happened."
1,Crossroads of Boredom,"Now I have been a huge fan of the WOT series. Books 1-6 were absolutely awesome. After ""Lord of Chaos"" the series started to die down. ""Crown of Swords"" was an ok addition, ""Path of Daggers"" started the slow movement of the plot, ""Winters Heart"" almost brought the story to a standstill, but with this new addition ""Crossroads of Twilight"" RJ has brought the WOT series to an all time low. This book contained 678 pages of pointless detail. The highpoints in this book as far as im concerned were Mat's brief encounters with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Rands VERY brief appearances. To summarize you could read about three chapters of this book and still know enough not to be lost when the next one comes out. And since RJ is taking his sweet time releasing these you can expect the next one some time in 2007!!!"
2,Dog Lover,Great treat for training and rewarding your pet. My dog loves these treats. The size works so well for my dogs too.
1,Piece of crap,"The simple old one I had from CH just wore out after 10 or 12 years. That's expected. But now they don't make it anymore - they have this newfangled fancypants one which leaks like a sieve. I put tape around the threads, everything, and the old one that's all cracked and dry rotted still works better. I just lost 5 pounds of air pressure in a truck tire. I'm not happy, and will be trying to return this."
1,Good for a time,I've had this cord for about 2 1/2 years now and up until this time it worked great. The the cord rolls in and out smoothly but just recently it stopped working properly and it will only play from one side of the car.I would have liked for the product to have a greater longevity than 2.5 years... most people own a car and ipod for much longer.
2,Gift idea,I got this thinking that I would give them out as gifts. These are great knifes and made really well.I recommend this product fully.
2,"Coby 7"" TV","The Coby 7"" TV that I ordered from Amazon.com last month is a very good TV and it is working very good."
2,What I think the book's strong points are.,"I loved it. While this is not Vonnegut's most powerful book, this is still a great read. The characterization of Rudy Waltz (aka ""Deadey Dick"") is touching and funny. Vonnegut's absurd tale of Rudy Waltz's accidental shooting of Eloise Metzger could happen to anyone. I also liked Vonnegut's X-Files touch of having Rudy's hometown of Midland City, Ohio hit by a neutron bomb explosion that probably came from the government in attempt to oppress it's people. Vonnegut's book offers something for every reader."
1,Pass this one up!,"I bought this gate based on the metal construction, ability to screw securely to the wall and the alarm feature. Once I got it home I found that the locking mechanism is very poorly designed. The locking latch pivots on a center pin with a spring to return it to the locked position. The only problem is that the spring isn't strong enough to return the latch to it's home position which allows the gate to be opened without having to use the latch - which kind of defeats the purpose of the lock to start with.Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the Safeway gate - a friend has it and it actually works."
2,Stunning artwork and great recipes!,"This is a beautiful book worth purchasing for the watercolor paintings alone. The book is organized by vegetable type, and several heirloom varieties are described in each section. Interesting, simple, mostly vegetarian recipes are provided, as well as historical and cultural information. This makes a great gift book!"
1,Not quite sure,I received the item and I used it for about a minute and the fuse blew. My husband put in the fuse that came with the cutter and it also blew. We are going to buy a new fuse and try it again. If this does not work I will be returning the item.
1,"""Horrible Ending""",I lot of what I enjoy most about reading romance novels are the happy endings. I was so dissapointed in the story when the mistress shows up at the end. It really took away from the reconcilation that was happening between John and Viola. I think it would have been a better story if the mistress faded out of the story with no attachments. There was a lot of forgiveness envolved in the story....but enough is enough. I don't read romance for that kind of drama. That was a bit upsetting for me. This book is not a keeper. I gave it a two because the ending destroyed any likes of the entire story.
1,Pretty...but pretty worthless,"These books were originally written for a French audience, and so unless your climate matches that of France, the statements about the weather that accompanies each season will be inaccurate! ""Spring is the season of mild, showery weather""...summer is a time of brief thunderstorms...beaches aren't cloudy for long...autumn is ""cool"" and ""damp""...and it snows in the winter. In addition, like virtually all the books in this series, it contains factual errors--""no two snowflakes are alike."" That's substituting folklore for fact, which is common with these books.The good points:-The illustrations are lovely-There is a brief, accurate (as far as it goes) description of fog, rainbows, and snow (""ice crystals"")-There is a discussion of the seasons, even if all the details are unlikely to match your climate.This saves it--barely--from one star."
2,hilariously quirky,"I remember this movie when it was first released. I have always thought that it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The lead character Dennis Cooper is disinherited by his father and scorned by the woman he loves. Thus, he sets out on his own to make his way in the world. He succeeds beyond his dreams and in the process wins all the things he doesn't want. Fame, adoration of the people and the hand of the princess in marriage. If you get a chance to see this movie or to own the video I highly recommend it."
1,JNDI for truck drivers,"I don't know who writes such books and who reads them. 800 pages of garbage. Instead of explaining what JNDI is, they show millions of lines of code, use us how to import packages and catch exceptions.I only wonder - are technologies failing because there are no good tutorials, or bad technologies provoke writing bad books."
1,A big disappointment,"I really like the book, it was a good alternate history . And was a great spoof of all the Lincoln books flooding the stores these days.As for the movie, a poor script and the producers,trying to adhere to the strict PC code of Hollywood, caused a disjointed editing. All these factors doomed this movie to the pitiful, was of time and money that it is. Save your money see it on Cable"
1,Mumbo jumbo,"I saw the author in the magazine Yoga for Everybody was inpressed by the article. The book had to be just as good? NO. I was looking for yoga to stretch and exercise and instead got more religion and philosophy. If your into the yoga as a religous or spiritual quest, this is a good book for you. If you want to learn how to become more toned and limber there are much better books out there. Yoga for men? No. Yoga for New Age Mr. Poneytail types. Yes."
2,Yummy!,Amazing cookie recipes. Just love Rose's introduction. She writes from the heart and as in all her books her recipes are so precisely written which makes baking so easy!
1,"Dude, Where's My Car?","So, my brother, his friends and I decided one saturday night to check this film out.The previews made sure to avoid the ridiculously stupid ""aliens"" are after them plot that takes over the movie. It really isn't even about finding his car. The acting was bad, the plot was from one of the worst scripts ever made, and the only funny parts were all shown in the previews. The only reason this has received any good reviews is that almost all the people who watched it were young kids who think it is cool to like this horrible show. Do not even waste your time.If you're into stupid comedy, watch ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"".SHIBBY..."
1,Repeats itself too much,This book spends more time telling what you're going to read than the actual material you're supposed to learn. I returned the copy because the jacket was damaged but with no regrets or replacement.
1,Doesn't work with Intel Personal Audio player,"Don't buy it if you own an Intel Personal Audio player, they're not compatable."
2,"""I don't think you understand. These boys killed my dog.""","I understand. Because I love dogs too.Shooter was exactly what I expected, an exciting, action packed story about an expert marksman who is framed for a political assassination. Along the way to proving his innocence, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swaggert has to enlist the help of an FBI agent, the ex-wife of his former spotter, and a crooked US Senator.I didn't expect much from this film, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm also pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and entertaining this movie was. I'm all for vengeance in the name of man's best friend. Really. They shouldn't have killed his dog."
1,"Gun Valkyrie is ok, but it is nothing compared to Halo","I was a little put out on this game. I gave it a good hour, and I tried to get into it, but I could'nt. The fine people at Sega, I would say, missed a really good chance to make a really good game. Its basically a point and shoot game, but it does alot of the pointing for you. The controls are frustrating and the whole concept seems un-original. Like I said, its ok. But not a great game."
1,The Polar expresss in 3d,"IT is not a very good 3D DVD, I got it because there are good review that was I got it. I'm dispointed."
2,Best book I've read,This is one of the best books I've ever read out of all the books I've read. It's even better than the Hunger Games in my opinion.
2,Loved it.,"I personally loved this movie dearly and am going to watch it again tonight with a group of friends. I having heard very little about this movie before seeing it so I didn't know what to expect from it. I had heard one friend of mine say it had okay acting and questionable music. Now I disagree with her. Something about this movie made me feel happy. I love Sara Rue and Kett Turton both madly. I loved watching this, and ended up teary eyed at the end. It is not a movie that everyone would love for their own reasons but I want to own it..."
1,Bunk,"I started reading this book which echoe'd a lot of other books in this genre, but partway through the book something seemed off. I went online and started to look more into David Hawkins and Kinesiology, which is used as a basis for all of his claims.Pretty soon the entire world of woo and pseudoscience that this book is based on came crumbling down and I realized just how misguided books like this are.It's ignorance and prejudice masking itself as enlightenment, with Hawkins as the self-appointed arbiter of good vs. evil (but cleverly hidden behind the practice of kinesiology).The only redeeming thing about this book is that it precipitated the undoing of a lot of unfalsifiable and erroneous beliefs that I had accumulated over the years that has been based on bunk like the kind Hawkins peddles to the unwary."
1,YOW! Buy something Else!,"This ranks among the worst software that I have ever used. I have Professional Home Design Suite Platinum version 10. You set the elevation for each floor, the program changes it to something else. Walls appear in the 3-D renderings and can't be erased. The keyboard shortcuts don't work. You apply shingles to the 3-d elevations, and the program renders the windows with shingles. You try to get tech support answers to the above issues and you can't even get past the first tech support screen. Hello...Is anybody home?"
1,aren't we smart?,"This is a glib romp through difficult terrain. The authors seem to answer lots of questions, but after a while their answers become predictable and increasingly superficial. No problem is so tough that they can't solve. No doubt is so deep that they can't dispel. They write as if they are the C. S. Lewis of the 21st Century. They aren't."
1,Read at your own risk!,"This book would better have been entitled ""Deviant Irish Women."" This is no children's book, as a quick glance at the graphic and gruesome illustrations prove. More horror than history, its stories of greedy, murderous women are not for readers interested in women and their roles in Irish history, but for those interested in gory, almost misogynistic stories about the most irredemable women Irish history has to offer."
2,Still using after 8 years,I got this bag when my oldest son was born. I love it because I have always traveled light and I hate bulky bags. I got the black/graphite color so my husband won't carrying. This bag has survived two kids and my youngest is now 4 1/2 years old. And it still looks great. I still use it as a purse and for outings. People always ask me where I got such a cool bag!
1,Tries to be 2 types of shower but not good at either,"This shower head can function either as a rain shower where it uses all the jets, or as a more traditional shower where it only uses the nozzles in the middle of the shower head.The problem is it isn't good at either.In rain shower mode, you notice the rain pattern isn't very even. Its stronger in the middle, and very soft towards the edges. It feels weak and disappointing even for a rain shower.In the traditional mode, there are insufficient nozzles for it to compete with a single function head like a Kohler Katalyst model. Further it's not that powerful even without the flow limiter.Final issue is the build quality is really poor. It's all plastic and feels really cheap. Can't imagine this lasting."
1,Short-lived,"Total disappointment! Initially, it worked great. 4 months later, dead in the water! Talk about built-in obsolescence! $45 dollars X 135 days = stealing!"
2,Ella shes cool,"Ella's been cursed ever since she were born, when she is sixteen,her life start to change. Prince Char had fall in love with her ever since they met in her mothers fineral. But Ella didn't feel it the first time, but not until she start writting letter to him, they loved each other, but do you think her wicked sister will let her, or can she break the curse herself?The answers in your hand, just read it, this book are great!"
1,Snob,"I'm Japanese and knew of this book in 1996. Many people applauded it, but I'm against them. I thought the authour seemed as if she had knew everything on anime, assuming an authority on Japanese culture. Ms. Levi takes a superficial view of anime."
1,Specs are not Detailed Enough,"I am not an expert in heating and ventilation and sure enough don't know much about bathroom fans. Never got around to testing the unit simply because it didn't fit our vent pipe in the bathroom. The shape of the pipe wasn't mentioned in the item description. This particular fan has round pipe and the one I have in my bath is square, of course. Doesn't take genius to realize that round and square don't go together for a proper fit..."
1,"Snoozle, no way! I like the Bumpil pillow and baby play combo.","I had a snoozle for two days and returned it. It was a pain to get comfortable with. It was like a tube that needed flattening. My mother bought me a bumpil from this little boutique downtown and paid about the same amount that I paid for my snoozle. This pregnancy pillow is awesome because it is so easy to get comfortable with and when baby gets here in just a few days, he can also enjoy the pillow because it opens up to a baby play area. Just My Opinion."
1,NOT like the picture shows,"the picture shows a gold plated quality cable. this one came 1. not gold plated 2. not a good quality cableIn fact, it didn't even work as a substitute for my current cable. I am mad i payed 5 bucks including shipping for this.. definitely not worth it. the first one i bought was 3 and actually worked, i got this one as a substitute since it appeared gold plated.What a piece of..... (you name it) How does this get such good reviews?"
1,Not that great,The case has a nice tight fit. Almost too tight. If you ever need to get it off - you will struggle. The main complaint I have with the case is the plastic that covers the front face is so tight that it makes bubbles on top of the phone's plastic front - making it difficult to read. The thumbwheel is also hard to use when in the case.I don't think this case would be much protection if you were to drop it either.Overall I think there are better case options for this phone.
2,this is the bomb,"this album is deep. it has heaps of hidden messages, and the beats are all good as well. the song against all odds is phat, and how it sticks it to nas makes it evan betta. westside till i die. Tupac aka makaveli R.I.P"
1,It's little me vs. the masses and one very rich Mr. Golden,"Can you argue with money and wicked mad sales? Sure! My boss said, Must read! Must read! And, I did! I did! The opening was beautiful, and then...ZZZZZzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzZZZZZZzzz *clunk* Whah?"
2,Disgusting........,"I already wrote a review a few years a go...which is still posted, but I must now say that I am even more disgusted by the price that is being asked for this disc:Places like ValleyCD should be shut down for pricing a bands CD for over 200 dollars...going against exactly what the music stood for at the time!!!What's even more sad is the fact that there is going to be someone who would actually spend that much on the disc!!! I remember buying this tape in the 80's for around 4 or 5 dollars...Stop feeding into capitalistic scumbags by purchasing amazing music that stood for freedom of self without opression for what most of the individuals who listened to the music could not afford in the first place!!!"
2,Crank it up!,"I can describe this ""lost"" e.p. in one word: bitchen! It delivers from beginning to end. A super group of sorts they put out this e.p. and then nothing. Hopefully more is on the way. In the meantime, if you find it, buy it!"
2,A Must Watch Series!,"When this series came on television, I ignorantly overlooked it. I was so in tune with the ending and beginning of shows on HBO, Showtime, etc. Television shows weren't doing it for me. They were cliche and boring. A friend asked me if I watched ""Breaking Bad"", and I said no. He insisted that I watch it. I was 2 seasons behind, so I went and bought the first 2 seasons. Wow! I couldn't believe what I was missing. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue..absolutely incredible.I can't wait for this to be released so I can watch Mr. White and his counterpart handle their business...."
2,Good if you know what you're doing.,"For my supra 88, I had to punch holes in it which was kind of dangerous and the bolts for the holes has to be at the right distance to the tube which can cause problems but lucky I have a friend with the right equipment which really helped me out. All in all a good product but require good measuring skills and the proper equipment for it. Make sure you have the tools to punch holes and its the exact holes before you take out you're old air box."
1,Head Lights,How would anybody know what these are like when Amazon says they are not available and dont know if they are even going to have them again! Ridiculous!
2,My third purchase and probably not my last,"Nowadays every time a new electronic comes into the house it seems to need a HDMI cable. And every time I come right back here to Amazon to buy more. I have purchased a total of 9 cables in varying lengths, anywhere from 3-10 feet and they have all been shipped fast and of good working quality. The price makes them my number one pick and I don't even bother to comparison shop anymore. Overall I would recommend them if you are looking to make a purchase."
1,"Prehistoric Menu Options ~ What Were you Thinking, Disney?","Cartoons are swell. However, it's a MAJOR disappointment/ Hassle to have to click ""Play"" on EVERY Single toon. You can't simply ""Play All"". You must reload each toon from the menu. Not only that, you must click down to the next one, it doesn't do it automatically. It's not out of laziness, but necessity! I put this on for my 2 year old so I can do some household chores but every 6 minutes my son's screaming for me to change the dvd. [A real Horse & Buggyesque Menu, Disney!] I think these discs should be recalled and replaced to us owners free-of-charge by the corporate giant."
1,String broke in 2 weeks,"I'm new to cello, so not really sure what happened, but this string broke within two weeks of purchasing. Since I am a new student, I'm really only practicing ~30 min/day. Very disappointed that this string broke so quickly."
2,Great help for DIY boaters!,We just used this book as reference for redoing our teak on a 20 year old sailboat - it looks great - she gives the boater all options of removal and then the same options for varnish? oil? or Sikkens? Always the issue on what to use - we went traditional varnish and are seeing great results. Very helpful book.
1,Can't take high heat,Received a set of Calphalon kitchen tools last Christmas after placing them on my wishlist -- hoping to update a sturdy set of All Clad ones I've had for 10+ years that were starting to show their age. The turners have both melted at the ends and looked terrible after only a few months' use. Terrible product. Very disappointed. Now looking for a different brand to replace them already. :(
2,loved it!,I watched this movie YEARS ago and I just recently picked up reading again the past year and read the book. It was soo good that I had to buy the movie to watch it also! reading the book is 100% recommended. Movie is just beautiful.
1,Not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy,"Knowing the controversy surrounding this book, I bought it anyway thinking that the story might be a good one, even if it had been fabricated. I kept that attitude for about 2/3 of the book. At that point I got tired of listening to Frey, an admitted criminal, additct and all around loser, criticize those around him who had been able to do what he was incapable of--stay sober. His attitude that he was better and more sophisticated than the program he was participating in sounded like the immature rantings of an adolescent. I found it laughable that someone whose life was so obviously out of control had such a sense of superiority. I was also left wondering how he managed to maintain this sense of superiority when it was obvious that the program managed to help him, seemingly against his will. In the end, not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy."
1,Incredibly frustrating toy,"This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately."
1,Just one man's opinion,"Not only was this book homophobic, the whole book was fiction strung together with quotes and studies that are not footnoted. Some of the studies I recognized and have been debunked. This is not to say that the topic is not a worthy one for discussion. However, the book was boring and amaturish. I was expecting the caliber of Jared M. Diamond or Sperm War by Robin BakerA heterosexual male"
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this book last year and found it more annoying than helpful. The author's ""cute"" rhetoric was more distracting than helpful nor did I find any of her advice all that beneficial. The examples were overly simplistic and did not reflect the difficulty of the test. Her approach is superficial at best and downplays the rigorous nature of the test itself. This book was definitely a waste of money. The Barrons vocabulary list is far superior to anything in ""Dummies."" I am going with Kaplan this time and anxiously awaiting the new edition of the ETS book."
2,Many true-to-life scenarios,"I was very entertained by this book--by the genuine feelings and actions of the main character--Joey Becker. Jo's rationalization of her actions and her criticism of those rationalizations was something many female readers can relate to. However, I did find Daniel's character a little too saintly and the daughters a bit too nasty. I was enthralled however with the youngest daughter's explanation for the nastiness in the twins. This book was filled with many experiences that are true to life!"
1,Not researched well enough to really do that much good.,I wasn't that impressed with this book although I agree wholeheartedly with her message. A very sloppy effort on her part.
1,unrated version,"the other reviewer must have seen the xxx version ,this is the unrated version .if you like softcore porn and comedy i would recommend this however the movie is not so nice,i would avoid this movie like the tears of gypsies"
2,"Terrific movie, terrific CD","The movie was so amazing that I bought it along with the CD. It encompasses all of the Mama Cass songs from the movie plus many additional Mamas and Papas songs. It's truly a great CD from start to finish. Feel good, upbeat music. Definately worth it."
2,A MUST HAVE!,"After watching this just a few times, my 2-year-old daughter went from recognizing most of the alphabet to flawlessly knowing her letters and their sounds. She loves to watch and gladly watches the entire show without losing interest. The results are simply amazing!"
2,Editing would have produced a great mystery!,"Why didn't an editor cut most of the first 100+ pages? We mystery readers already grasp the efforts inherent in starting the search. Also, I agree with others' comments that the humor isn't as prevalent as in the earlier Kinsey Milhone mysteries. Too, I was disappointed by the ending, which required a few more pages to resolve the mystery. However, Sue Grafton can write, and I wouldn't miss reading any of her mysteries!"
2,What a ride!!!,Wow! After hearing Mindi's music on the radio for some time I finally decided to buy one of her cd's. I am so glad that I did. This album is an emotional journey from start to finish. There were times when I felt like I had to catch my breath. Some songs made me want to dance and some songs made me feel. This is easily the best instrumental album that I have heard this year. I especially love the song Rain that she wrote for the victims of Katrina. It kind of reminds me of something Sting might do if he were a sax player. Thank you Mindi!!!!!
1,. . . The PF's Greatest Hits . . . Not Quite . . .,"Arista's lack of care & concern for detail shines brightly in this disappointing compilation! While it may be true that the majority of the songs do indeed belong to the ""Partridges,"" there are two which clearly do not -- ""Cherish"" & ""Could It Be Forever"" -- both of which can be easily located on David Cassidy's first solo album (1972's ""Cherish"").A little bit of research goes a long way!"
2,Learning,"i bought this for spiritual enrichment and sadly it didnt deliver, however it will grow you in knowledge on new hero's and facts that have been long forgotten."
2,Fabulous Naturopathic History Book!,"I highly recommend this book for study. The author gave good background information for each of the important 'pioneers' for Nature Cure, leading up to the Naturopathic Movement."
2,Hail Lennon-Saviour of Rock and Roll in history,"John Lennon ""Walls and Bridges"" was great.This album was made at a time when Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono had collapsed.1974 was a year of chaos and joy for John Lennon.""Wheatever gets Thru the Night"" was a great rock dancer song(Elton John was colaboreted in this song playing keyboards).The supporting cast of musicians is too numerous to name, but there are two 'guest' musicians of note: Elton John and Harry Nilsson. Kudos go to Elton John for his role in getting John Lennon back on track and reunited with Yoko Ono.Hail Lennon, you are great. The album is ESSENTIAL"
2,Great book,I am a beginner and it's a wonderful book with proper descriptions - I use it at home and very glad for it.
1,This headset in 3 month is not charging,"I recomend to buy other brand this one is not good, in less that 3 month the battery life last only 2 hrs. (BAD)"
1,Description on item is wrong.,"I actually love the Petzl headlamps, very light and comfortable and well made. The reason I am giving this one star is the descption indicates that the light has 3 brightness levels and an blinking mode which it doesn't. It also indicates it has 4 leds which contradicts the title of the item. I think it's worth the extra money to get the version that actually has the 3 brightness levels and the blinking mode."
2,"""The Dr. Is In""","I don't know why some say this was not as good as Hellraiser. I seen Hellraiser and the hooks where pretty much the sickest thing in the movie. This one on the other hand goes over the deep end. Not to many movies dare to show a viewer what a trip in hell might look like. I remember way back in the day seeing this for the first time and it was one of the only horror movies I could remember keeping me on the edge of my seat. No I wasn't scarred, just so into it I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Definitely own this movie!!"
1,Yawn! Mars seems to be a straight world.,"Oh my, the characters are straigt. Being described during the first pages of the book, they don't stop to act in predictable pathways... if they act at all. Quite a lot of the pages are filled with boring details of technology and science. Of course technology and science are not boring, but this is supposed to be fiction, right? The action of the protagonists is being reduced to some kind of micropolitics. There don't seem to be feelings involved. Then suddenly the characters are old and so what!"
1,"Beautifully written, without a plot","After waiting 10 years for Donna Tartt to write another book, I alternate between being sorely disappointed in this, and vastly impressed by her beautiful prose. Though the writing is splendid, the imagery vivid, and the characters are sublimely developed, the plot plods along at an interminably slow pace, and the ending is atrocious. By the 555th page, the reader would appreciate having an ending, but Tartt refuses, merely ending the book wherever she saw fit, with absolutely no point whatsoever. This doesn't hold a candle to her debut novel, ""The Secret History."""
1,What the f?,"I'm appauled at the person who approved this screenplay. He probably thought they could capitalize off the success of Barbershop.I didn't laugh at anyone really. I thought Alicia Silverstone was awful. She wasn't her usual jovial self. Queen Latifah's role as the strong black woman who thinks white people are crazy is getting old. The rest of the cast seemed to try to parallel Barbershop's cast. I saw one woman trying to be the old wise person(Cedric the Entertainer), but she couldn't pull it off because she just came off as ignorant and annoying. For the most part, the hair masters did their best to live up to the stereotypes we all have in our minds. It wasn't outrageous.Skip this movie."
1,"Should have ""multipassed this one up""!","We purchased this product because of Canon's reputation. We have used other Canon products and were totally pleased, however, we were disappointed in the need for frequent ink tank changes. Also, we believed we were getting a color scanner as well as black and white. We should have done our homework more thoroughly. Very disappointed!"
1,Leases & Rental Agreements (NOLO),"It was not what I had expected and the disk will not run at all no matter what I try and do. What a waste of money.Very, Very disappointed."
2,"Simple, low-tech, and wonderful!","If you're looking for a digital appliance, with timers and auto-this and auto-that, than you're looking at the wrong oven. However, if you want something that packs a lot of good uses in a relatively small space, this is it. I've roasted chickens, defrosted frozen items, made small pizzas, re-heated pizza slices (vastly superior to microwaving!), baked rolls, cooked small casseroles, and I'm very pleased. The only thing it can't do (at least not to my satisfaction) is toast bread, but that's just a fact about all ""toaster""-ovens I've ever used. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first one I received was damaged (clearly at the factory, not during shipping), and the door on its replacement occasionally requires a tap on one of its hinges when shutting it, or it won't shut completely (I'll fix that, one of these days....) But, all things considered, it's well worth its place on my kitchen counter."
2,Suggested gift for the falsely accused,"There are many unexpected gems in this book: Chapter 10 has a wonderful, very useful explanation on anatomical dolls; I particularly liked pages 105, 108, and 112. In Chapter 11 on ""Agencies,"" look forward to page 121. And Chapter 12 describes a volunteer court-monitoring system which excited my pronounced sense of proactivism. Sate your appetite for very useful information. Happy Holidays from falseallegations.com!"
2,Wow...WOW!,"This is a total want purchase. It is a gamers fantasy. I suppose some would have other uses for it but for gaming I was blown away. And, um yeeaaaahhh, if you don't know how to change your desktop settings steer clear of this card and while you're at it, cellophane bags and sharp objects.There isn't a game out there that will stress this card-- yet.I am running Homeworld 2 at 1280 x 1024 with all the settings cranked. (The EMP of ships exploding is awesome!)BF1942/Desert Combat 1600 x 1200 16bit color or 1280 x 1024 32 bit color.Medieval: Total War is maxed.Fun, fun, fun."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"If your a fan of shocking and crazy videos of people getting shot, ran over, or people jumping to their death. Then don't buy this dvd it sucks plain and simple all it shows is the aftermath of people who died and it doesn't even tell you how the died all you see is people like cops and EMTs poking at a dead body. Waste of money and time save your money for something else like BANNED FROM TELEVISON... NOW THAT IS A GOOD DVD."
2,THE TRUTH!,"Here's what's up with dis'.If you have ever been caught up in one of those ""twighlight 'kind of dreams,but you were really awake,then you probably might have listening to this,or one of the other gems that WORDSOUND has realeased in the last10?years.All I can say is that this is a soundtrack to your inna-illbient-self.I collect this stuff,believe me when I say that SLOTEK 7 is a classic.With Numerology being the underlying theme here,always interesting,never boring.I set out to find music that has a formula,and found this bubbling up from the crypts! starz"
1,Don't waste your time,The first third of the book was good and fast paced but as you keep reading the book gets dull and boring. I really don't know why I finished it. Maybe 20 years ago it was a blockbuster but I don't think it is now.
2,A solid effort,"The Corrs are back, and it's a joy to hear the dozen new songs they present on Borrowed Heaven. Highlights include Angel and Goodbye, the contrasting but touching tributes to their mother, Jean, written by Andrea and Sharon Corr respectively. The title track is infused with the African beats of Ladysmith Black Mambaso, which lends a lovely dimension to the Corrs sound. The beautiful Time Enough For Tears, from the film ""In America"", is a worthy addition, albeit a little different from the rest of the album. Even If is impossibly catchy, but overshadows the similar-sounding Confidence For Quiet - indeed, there seems to be a standard song structure formula across a few songs, but other than that, the album as a whole is more than pleasant and showcases some fine work by the band."
2,Pappa's Progression,"Pappa continues with his strong progressive sound, forcing his way forward. Pappa's track selection includes music from breeder, humate, narcotik, and hybrid. Pappa keeps this cd moving with Breeder's Angel Dust. Great song with strong powerful beats. Hybrid's Kill City is awesome. Soft and full of vocals yet a powerful and progressive song. This song takes the icing on the cake. In this cd Pappa keeps the energy flowing and continues with his strong momentum, never slacking up. Pappa definitely has a lot of talent and a driving mixing style."
2,Best Darn Music,The songs from this movie have always been great dancing to & listening to sounds.Just what the doctor ordered
1,Not Good Shears At All,"Potential buyers of the Wusthof Come-Apart Kitchen Shears,I bought these shears to replace my very old Chicago Cutlery ones that I have had for over 10 years. I was unimpressed by everything except the sharpness. The handles are not ergonomic at all and actually hurt after a while, which I can deal with, b/c I don't use these for more than a minute or so each time I use them. However the most disapointing thing about these shears is that they started to rust at the pivot point where they connect after only 2 months. These shears don't even stand a chance at lasting one quarter as long as my Chicago Cutlery ones, which I thought were decent but nontheless. I will be looking at different brands to replace these soon.Sincerely,The KitchenConnoisseur"
2,Large,"What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
2,Almost there,Almost perfect but I have found some roads that are not on this disk that were constructed early enough (within last 5 years or maybe longer) that they should have been on there.
1,Don't bother if you have a thick beard,"Like a few others said, don't bother if you're a man with a thick beard. I followed the directions closely and it made no noticeable difference on my chin where the hair is thickest. I wish it would work because I can't shave without getting bad ingrown hairs but I might as well be putting lotion on my face as this stuff."
1,Did Anyone Actually Research This Before Filming?,"I saw the Faye Dunaway scene and it was pretty inaccurate as far as its alleged account of a gathering at Mae West's home. The filmmakers couldn't research a simple fact as small as where Mae actually lived? That info is so easily available. It certainly made it hard for me to get absorbed into the film. If the rest of the film is as bad, it's definitely not worth buying. I wanted to give this 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me."
1,wendyr,"We purchased this because I wanted a whistling tea kettle. I am very disappointed because after only several months of occasional use, the whistle component has broken off and fallen out of the kettle. It can not be repaired.The look is sleek and the kettle opens automatically when you start to pour but this does not justify the cost, esp, when it does not last!! Find another kettle that costs less!"
1,Nothing cookie about it...,"These bars taste nothing like cookies or cream. They're a strange flavor of cocoa flavored cardboard and chewy stuff. Stick with the peanut better flavor. It's 1,000 times better."
1,beware,Buyers beware this is not the study guide for the current text book it is for an older version. Don't make the same mistake I did.
2,Welcome Addition to My Set Up,"The Canon Hand Strap is a welcome addition to my 40D and battery pack. It offers the ability for a bit more stability and comfort in handling. The set up allows the choice of hand strap, neck strap or both. The only thing that's a bit confusing is how it attaches to the camera. No instructions are included. I wrote to Canon and they sent me a pdf with well written instructions."
1,what the hell is this?!,"This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Who is this guy doing eminem's songs and how did he get a CD? I could've done this myself. He can't even flow. If you buy this, then i have no pity for you."
2,Dryer Vent,This is just as described. Makes it so convenient since I'm renting and don't want to do any changes to the house structure. The only thing is that over time the clips may become worn out but that is really no big concern.
1,Didn't do what I needed them to.,"These food markers may be good for writing on some food surfaces. I needed them to write on white chocolate covered marshmallows. They did not work at all. No matter how much or how little pressure I applied, they simply scratched the coating, but didn't write. They wrote on the paper towel I wiped them off with, but I could write on paper with a Sharpie. I tried holding the marker straight up and down, and at several different angles. It simply did not work. I ended up using icing and a lettering tip."
1,dosent deserve even 1 star,"This is possibly the worst book that has ever been written. There is no plot, and no aparent theme unless you count death, misery, space, and martians. I have heard kindergardeners come up with stories much better than this, in fact i dont know how this book was ever published. This is a book that inspires you to write a book becuase it shows that basically it can be as crappy as you want becuase obviosly publishers cant tell good literature from bad. This big is terrible! dont buy it!!!"
2,My new go grill,"This review is for Weber 121020 Go-Anywhere Charcoal Grill .Used it for patio/deck/camping barbecue.Assembly is simple(SAR).It toook me 5-6 min to fully assemble this.It is big enough for family of four for light grilling.Although my thought on paying 50$ for a boxed metal sheet too much but then the quality on this is good if not the best.Hope I will get few years out of it.I highly recommend some cover or atleast a plastic bag over it ,if you are planning to leave it on deck/patio.Also highly recommended is a small/medium grill cleaner.To protect the base cover it with aluminum foil so that you dont have to clean up the mess falling from the grill.There is a little heat transfer to the bottom so a wooden plank or a flat stone is recommended for those expensive decks just to be safe."
2,a fun & cute movie,it was fun. i love the director's cut. just wish those scenes were shown when it was first released in the theatres in 1984. some were very crucial. i hope someone will do another supergirl in the future. a smart producer will. enjoy.****
2,Whistle Lanyards,What can you say: it's just a lanyard. I buy these for all my volleyball referees on the NYC Board because of the good quality.The seller was very efficient and quick with the order - a great pleasure to deal with. I will buy from them again next year.
2,Excellent product.,"This is a great DVD and used along with the book (by the same name) it has been a wonderful tool in my university class. Not only is the interview between Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell interesting, but there are many clips from _Star Wars_ and images of great art to augment their discussion. And the bonus interview with Bill Moyers and George Lucas is fascinating too."
1,Brian Yuzna should have steered clear,Brian Yuzna should have avoided being associated in any way with this waste of celluloid.
2,A Special Insight Into Muhammad,"This is a wonderful and in-depth look into Muhammad Ali's life as told by those closest to him.My only complaint is that the chapters ran a bit too long - not in content and not long as in boring or bad/useless information - not that at all. I'm a slow reader and it was simply time consuming to finish each chapter.The chapters are told to you by Ali's friends, family, contemporaries and the man himself.You really get a feeling for Muhammad - the person not just the boxer - through his family, friends and those that know him. I put the book down feeling closer to Muhammad Ali and feeling a warmth from him and a warmth towards those he loves and cares for...I walked away from this book with such great feelings for Muhammad Ali. I felt as if I'd laughed alongside with him - and that alone is worth reading this book"
2,Its an ending,"The movie ends the full metal alchemist, the first anime adaptation, all right in my opinion, The picture quality is great as is the audio dubbing if you are interested. I didnt much care for the first adaption since it was so different from the manga but im just glad things ended unlike so many other anime adaptations where the series just ends without any conclusion whatsoever. If youre looking for some closure go ahead and get this movie."
2,Barry Manilow TV Specials,I am a huge Barry Manilow fan and remember watching these specials in the 70's and 80's so I was very excited to find them on DVD's. They are just as good now as then and if you are a Barry Manilow fan I think you will enjoy them.
1,This is the wrong size,"WARNING!!!I purchased this item because the review said it was 5.9"", however it is only 4.5"".It may fit the camera it was intended for, but I purchased it for another use based on the measurements in the description.I guess the joke is on me.You have been warned!"
1,Liz was gorgeous but movie was not so good,"When Liz passed this year, I bought many that I had never heard of before. This one was ok - she was so pretty - but not so keen on the story line."
1,not the bargen i thought,"the add does not show the optional spline or sds drive shankes needed for this tool the're expensive! now i have to weld a broken spline shank i saved ,not everyone can do this.i,m not happy i suggest you change the add"
1,Caution! Damages your carpeting,"This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet."
1,Junk..,I ordered the heater to help heat my basement. It sure is a disappointment . It has no thermostat and can not be left unattended. Who ever heard of a heater without temperature control. Will it burn my house down?
1,pretty good... but not really,"This is a good piece of equipment when it works... when it isn't working it is sometimes the buggiest internet connection ever. Maybe its the combo that sucks... I have an airport express wireless router by apple, since I have a couple mac laptops in my house, and my desktop (a hp media center m7750n) is a door down the hall. I never get 5 bars... sometimes it just doesn't work... and sometimes i get a message that says access: local only which just means im so close yet so far away from internet connection. Do not buy this product unless you're very patient."
1,Not the Best,"This is a reference book, so keep that in mind when reading; meaning, do not read it chapter by chapter. Secondly, the organization of the book is good, but it fails in its explanations. Lastly, if you need this book for class or an excellent Assembler reference book, get AND USE Bill Qualls' ""Mainframe Assembler Programming"" book...especially if you're using the PC/370 emulator."
2,Dorman 38437 Door Hinge Repair Kit,"This Kit did work , but if I was to do it again i would go for the kit with threaded studs"
1,Arrgh!!! Wish I was six feet under for much of season 5,"Can this thing drag out ANY longer than it did? For a show whose pilot episode was the best episode of the entire series, man these final seaons 4 and 5 dragged. I would have to give it just a 1-star but there is PARTIAl REDEMPTION because the finale was unique and actually uplifting. I realize it might be difficult to make a funeral home show uplifting, it was not just depressing in a more normal funeral home kind of way... it was depressing in a boring, milking-this-thing-too-long way."
1,Silk purse that's really a pig's ear,"I wrote a favorable review earlier, but that was before I knew (it was recently found in USSR records) that John Reed recieved over 1million from his pals in the bolsheviks/soviet union in the 1910s and 20s.It's not the movie's fault, because the makers had no way to know, that Reed was not so much an idealist who did too much dreaming for everyone's good, as a flat out paid communist agent serving his masters for cash and probably not asking too many hard questions to keep that cash coming in.Everybody admires an idealist (even one who is wrong), but nobody likes a toadie, and this revelation makes the movie, no matter how well done, mortally flawed and a waste of time."
2,Definitely is the Gold standard,"Mixes well, tastes great and is great for you. Casein protein from animal products are harmful for you body. 100% whey protein is very beneficial and this deal was a steal. $98 for 10 pounds of this. Can't ask for a better deal."
1,Very Disappointing,I would have never bought this movie if I would have known it was dubbed in English. Nothing on the outsite of the DVD box states that it is dubbed in English.
2,Wonderful book. I would highly recommend it.,Father Richard John Neuhaus of First Things Magazine recommended this book. For that I am truly thankful. I am only about a third of the way through it but am enjoying it immensely.
2,BANNED in Malaysia April 2005,"According to a article I clipped in KL, Malaysia during late April 2005, ""A History of God"" and ""Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet"" both by Karen Armstrong were just banned under the Printing and Publications Act 1984 (Amended) 1987. The possession, printing, reproduction, sale and distribution of the publications were prohibited and offenders could be jailed for 3 years or fined RM20,000 or both.Any book banned by the same government who banned the Bible (in one native language and later recinded the ban) should be seriously considered for reading."
1,Nothing Righteous,"Usually when a new album comes out from a favorite artist, you're excited. Finally five years after ""Relish"" out comes ""Righteous Love"" It surprised me initially how low key this release was. Why didn't they play anything from it on the radio, after how well ""One of us"" did on the charts. I quickly realized why after popping ""Rightous Love"" into my stereo. The first few tracks are okay, with a different sound from her previous album. Unfortunately the album goes down from there. The edgy, bluesy sound I liked so much on ""Relish"" and her ""Early Recordings"" is gone, whether filtered out or just a change in her singing, I don't know, but the result is disappointing and so so singing at best. She butchers through Dylan's love ballad ""To Make you Feel My Love"", which is probably the most unforgiveable part of this album. Its a shame but ""Righteous Love"" suffers the second album curse, DOA."
1,Just so disappointing,"I was just so disappointed with this book. Betancourt seems to have missed all of the opportunities afforded to him with this brilliantly realised universe. Gone are the interesting characters, gone is the sense of a deep and dangerous plot, gone is any semblance of the world that Zelazny wrote of.So much could have been made of this series -instead we seem to have Conan story or a Star Trek book by numbers.Utter rubbish"
2,serbian and yugoslav mauser rifles,"A little dis-appointed . Thought there would be more historical, specific info on particular models. Overall, I am ok with it. Thanks."
2,A definite MUST READ!,"The Three Musketeers series is so aesthetically written. The characters literally take hold of you and pull you back in time with them. There is an amplitude of adventure within each chapter. If you are attracted to sword fighting and galantry, then these books are for you. It would not be very sagacious to avoid reading these novels!"
2,Must read - shame you can't!,What a shame that this wonderful book is now out of print. Frankly it ought to be compulsory reading for anyone who ever ventures near a statistical test. Anyone who understands the assumptions behind a t-test should be able to grasp (and enjoy?) the arguments.
2,Wonderful Read!,"This tale of cross-dressing soldiers brought a smile to my face, in a way that only Terry Pratchett can! I can only imagine that, back in the day, women really did dress as men to be able to join the military.While giving bit parts to some old favorites, Pratchett introduces a whole new cast of characters to entertain the reader, in this book. Continuing with the theme of all Pratchett books, this will make any reader laugh, not only at the fantastical humor but also at the silly puns incorporated within...This is another of the Discworld series that does not require having read any of the previous books to be able to enjoy it. It would be a great stand alone novel for someone looking for a quick read.And ladies, remember that socks are the key...Courtney ConantAuthor ofThe Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))"
2,queen size memory foam mattress,Got the mattress exactly when I expected it. Slept on it that night. Outstanding nights sleep. I read other reviews on this before I ordered one and never really expected it to be as good as the reviews stated. It was that good. Every nights sleep has been awesome. If you dont have one of these mattresses get one!
2,Great for use on a slide board,I needed to make a melamine surface slippery for training on a speed skating slide board and this product worked perfectly.
2,There are no happy endings,"There are no happy endings. Things are the way they must be. In style this book is a lot like Clark's Law, you can almost see the chaptersas scenes already filmed and shown to you. I know that some may think that short chapters are distracting and hard to follow, but in my opinionthat isn't the case; it keeps the tempo up, and helps the reader to keep track of everything that's happening in multiple places at the same time.The story has two or three separate plots. The main plot concentrates on events surrounding G'Kar's incarceration. One plot studies whatLyndisty's plans for Vir really are and a separate plot allows John and Delenn get some time together, but not in the way they expected.The events take place in 2261, before ""Falling Toward Apotheosis""."
2,Good frame for the price,"Was looking around for a decent quality photo frame to gift to a friend. This frame was well within budget and had good features.It displays decent resolution photos, also plays MP3s along with the slideshow, and has 128mb inbuilt memory, which is sufficient for 100-200 photos @ 800x600 resolution.The only disadvantage I found was that writing to its internal memory was pretty slow."
2,a more thorough track listing,"This is a rare compilation of music recorded on radio station WXRT (either in studio or during broadcasts of concerts), some of the archives going back to the 1970's. Since there wasn't a proper run down on this page, I'm adding a track listing.1 Talking Heads - Pulled Up 4:062 Robert Cray - Guess I Showed Her 4:083 The Freddy Jones Band - In A Daydream 6:294 Richard Thompson - I Can't Wake Up to Save My Life 2:585 Lou Reed - Walk on the Wild Side 6:426 Bob Mould - Wishing Well 4:397 Buddy Guy - Dust My Broom 4:308 BoDeans - Sylvia 3:419 Concrete Blonde - Dance Along the Edge 5:3010 Bruce Cockburn - If I Had a Rocket Launcher 6:2111 Bob Marley - Natty Dread 8:3112 The Smithereens - Blood and Roses 6:40"
1,Jesus Certainly Does Walk! And I think he's a rapper! Bow Down To Mr. West!,"Probably one of the best records of all time. Kanye West goes to outshine every hip hopster ever with this album and his amazing rhymes and lyrics. Probably my favorite part of this album occurs on the hit single ""Gold Digger"" with Kanye's buddy Ra...Jamie Foxx.In this amazing feat of skillz, Kanye rhymes ""18 years"" with ""18 years"" in the line:""18 years, 18 yearsShe got one of yo kids got you for 18 years""He then follows it up with an even more amazing task of rhyming ""money"" with ""money"" with ""money"" and follows it up with rhyming all 3 ""money's"" with one more ""money"", as follows:""She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya moneyShe went to the doctor got lypo with ya moneyShe walkin around lookin like Micheal with ya moneyShould of got that insured got GEICO for ya money""!AMAZING! Bring on the Grammys!"
2,Tom Selleck in this role.,"I love Tom Selleck in any movie, but after reading the Jesse Stone books by Robert Parker, I feel he was made for the role. I hope that some of Jesse Stone can continue in spite of the passing of Robert Parker."
2,Excellent service,The jewel case was cracked on the original so they sent a new jewel case along with it. it was shipped and arrived before it was expected.
2,Insightful Journey to India,"Told through rich imagery along the sacred waters of the Ganga River, Claire invites you to embark on a very personal journey of self-revelation and spiritual growth. Her search to know and serve God is fueled by a willingness to leave behind past attitudes and to love without judgement or separation. Faithful effort is given to understanding situations that arise and learning that there are no accidents. When met with the unexpected river voyager - be it human or animal - Claire's account is told with humor and honesty. You feel her rapture with each realization and her uncertainty with each challenge. I hope she takes the advice of her newfound `angel' and visits Nepal. We could all benefit from the trip."
2,very strong drill bits,"Very standard set of drill bits, but they do their job and are very high quality. I am very happy with this product"
1,"40-pages of screenshots and sparse, poorly written text.","This is not a ""book,"" it's just a thin pamphlet. Its text is sparse and poorly written. I would be embarassed to have authored and released this title, if only for its abundant mechanical errors. Don't waste your money--add your $7.50 to the purchase of any of the multitude of legitimate Access texts available. If you only have $7.50 to spend on Access tutorial literature, you'll be far better off by just beginning to read the help files that accompany Access."
1,"""Ecco the Dolphin"" Sinks","This game has great graphics, great underwater AI, and Ecco is just like a real dolphin, but this game is TOO puzzling. I only managed to get past the first level. I regret buying it. Don't buy it."
1,I don't like it,Don't allow air to flow through the shirt. Sticks to your skin. Stitching from the reflective strips cause skin to itch
2,Baby book,"Cute book, arrived with seam coming apart. We fixed it and it seems to be ok now. The kit inside is very nice to have. I believe it will be a great book just the one problem, but pages are nice and book is nice."
2,BEST CANDY EVER!!!,"It maybe pricey, but damn it's good. It was worth the money I spent on it. I had my first taste of it back when I was 7 or 8 at an elementary school. The teacher was always giving this out as a snack for the students. For years I tried to remember what this candy was, until I came across a pic of it on facebook. By then I knew exactly what it was and I decided to buy it here. I don't regret doing so. Enjoy!!!"
1,*sigh*,"Well, I have to say that I am saddened by this album. GC is relying way to much on the way people lable each other to market their music. I've seen way to many ""punk"" , ""preppies"" and ""posers"" in these reviews. When GC first came out, they were normal people. Yes, Benji had his tatoos and such, but nothing was nearly as milked as it is now. Now, bands like NFG and GC rely to much on the whole ""punk"" look and ""lifestyle""(no pun intended). No one seems to see that the music that they all play isn't ""punk"", it's just ""rock n roll"". Power chords and a nice drumbeat with a little acoustic ballad or so. And if you like it, more power to you, but I see it as way to generic. If you like music that is catchy and kind of repetative, with some meaningful lyrics, then go for it. If you want something with a little more originality and some very thought provoking lyrics, then go for Radiohead - The Bends, or At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command. And Green Day is always good."
2,Great!,One of my favorite authors. Great book to help you overcome the traps of the devil. Great insight & revelation.
2,Everyone should own a copy...,"Everyone should own a copy of this album because of the ""Sunscreen"" song that Luhrmann wrote like a commencement address. I listen to it at least once a week as a reminder to not lose sight of the forest for the trees. it touches on universal truths that you hope everyone understands. they're so simple, but so important to enjoying life today."
1,Cheaply made,The gold trim on the shoulder and around the bottom is already frayed. The eyelets have already torn loose after only one use. The seams on the pants are not sewn straight; pants twist when put on
1,Save Your Money,"I purchased this heater and it was a problem from day one. Out of about one hundred attempts to light, it has only worked three times! The pilot light ignites without problem, but it refuses to work beyond this point. Two out of the three times it worked, it went out when I tried to turn the control from high to low. I have since purchased three butane heaters that work flawlessly. I would not recommend this unit."
2,Genuine Man and his Fascinating journey thru Jewelry design,"I read the book and enjoyed all the photos from cover to cover!Robert Lee Morris is such a great natural designer, very genuine as human being.I found many similarities with his life and mine as a jewelry designer.I discovered that my first pieces were much like his style, when I didn't knew who he was and never saw his work before.Totally inspiring. You can be tempted to tear and frame the photos of the book as art pictures!Benjamin P.Puerto Rico"
1,Mixed Message,"The engaging and well-crafted main storyline in this novel earns it one star. The underlying message loses four stars. Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father. She still loves him but purposefully marries a slob, using him as a cover for her son. Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother. I can forgive his short-sightedness - he is a kid. Unfortunately, the author of this book is not."
2,YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS!,"This was my first Duran Duran album, and I have to say it is great. I'm only 22 years old, but I still can remember hearing some of these songs on the radio when I was a kid. They are as good today as they were then. If you grew up, lived through, or even thought about the eighties, you've got to have this album!"
2,Lots of power for its intended purpose & then some,"Looking for a way to cut higher branches too large for a rope-pull lopper, this is a great item. I'm encouraged at it's power and long battery life - both beyond what I was expecting. Do remember to oil the chain/cutter bar frequently, as others have mentioned. It'll be a happier helper. It cuts thicker (3 1/2"") boughs much more easily than I was expecting, with nary a protest. I'd get one again, for certain."
2,You need to see this movie!,"This is such a good movie! Kevin Kline plays a man who has a bad relationship with his wife (the lovely Kristin Scott-Thomas) and his son (Hayden Christensen, pre-Anakin Skywalker). A terminal illness forces him to reevaluate his life and try to make the most of the time he has left. This is an incredibly emotional film that always, always makes me cry. All three of the lead performers should have received Oscar nominations, in my humble opinion."
1,Offensive trash.,"What is this book about? If you're a pregnant non-Christian, your baby will die. If you're a pregnant Christian, your baby will be just fine. That's what it all boils down to. Just like Soul Harvest said that the only role for women was to get pregnant or die, now Apollyon says that good girls have babies while bad girls lose them. Such drivel is hardly a charitable presentation of the Christian gospel."
2,"Unique, breathtaking, a must buy.","FOX marketed this as a western. I hate westerns. I LOVED Firefly. The final (original?) two-hour episode ""Serenity"" is still lovingly saved on my TIVO because we can't bear to part with it. The writers of Firefly created characters that are human - not an idealized or perfect one in the bunch, all have their secrets and flaws. In spite of that (because of it?) the viewer is left with a deep connection and a desire to know them better. This isn't all CGI flash. It isn't just schmaltzy character development and human interest either. Firefly is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a very long time, and it is a tragedy that FOX didn't realize the gem they had and promote it properly. Buy the DVD set and watch it - you'll see fantastic acting, action, adventure, suspense, science fiction, frontier justice, and yes, great special effects."
2,"Excellent, but don't pay inflated prices","This was a budget import compilation, and dealers should not be demanding prices that would ordinarily be put on personally autographed first pressings with concert programs and other frills. Let them sit on their overpriced discs that wouldn't fetch $5 in a used CD store. There are plenty of excellent in-print cds by both Gordon and Jo, including other duet cds."
1,Daphne- not of the brilliant blue,"This movie is just a waste of money and the story is so juvenile that it might as well be rated NC-17 for how much skin can we show and not be rated XXX. Don't waste your money, especially if you have young children at home."
2,Excellent,"No ads. Large print. Beautiful illustrations. Interesting age appropriate stories. Every magazine by this publisher (Cricket, etc) are all quality magazines that are child centered.My daughter is five. I think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads' it cover to cover. She also enjoys looking at the pictures as well.This is worth every penny."
1,not happy,"We have many Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles that we are happy with...however, we are EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this puzzle. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! As other reviewers have mentioned it splinters and the pieces separate into layers. It is difficult to pull the pieces apart in order for our 3 year old to work on. Additionally it is dangerous with the one year old in the area. We would have taken it back but never returned to Discovery Center where it was purchased. Shame on you Melissa and Doug...need to re-work this one."
1,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I was looking for an inexpensive, but functional, bird feeder for my 8 year older bird-loving daughter. This looked like a great product. I liked the design of 3 distinct levels, but the construction was shoddy. The side seams were badly molded, leaving gaps. Also, the roof was missing altogether in my shipment. So while I like the idea of this feeder, I wasn't pleased with the actual item. I am, however, very pleased with Amazon's no-hassle return service. I guess I'll hope for better luck next time."
1,Broken out of the box,"I bought one that was broken out of the box. There was no physical damage, it just would not power on."
2,Excellent and much needed if not somewhat difficult treatise on Biblical historical study,I will say in short V. Philips Long is a masterful and capable theological communicator. This book is both accessible and necessary for the historical study of the Bible. He presents a wealth of information in a concise and readable form. It's only flaw(if it can be seen as such) is that it is very scholarly in its communication of the topic making it more difficult for a layman to read and digest at times). I wholeheartedly endorse the reading of this book if you either appreciate biblical historical study or desire to learn more about the process of biblical interpetation as it applies to either your own personal study or the teaching of the bible on an academic level.
2,Different,Very original. I've never read any book that contained the same basis of fantasy as this book. The warrior enters the body to fight against the demons. There was a lot of intregue and even a hint of mystery. I especially liked seeing the characters grow. The character of the prince was extremely well rounded. My only complaint was that it dragged just a little bit in a couple of areas.
2,Halo 2 review,"This game is so much fun. The many different game modes/maps, make this game a must buy for both xbox and xbox 360 owners. Even when just playing with 3 friends, this game is still incredibly fun. The single player story mode is also long and satisfying, and really fills you in on many aspects of the halo plot. The graphics are very nice looking, and the sound is great too. I would definitely either buy the map pack, or if you have xbox live, download the map pack/patch. The patch is especially important as it fixes many glitches like the rocket/sword lunge, and many others."
1,Don't be ripped off,"This disc is made up of practice sessions and other second-rate material. It is made from stolen goods and many of the tracks bear only a passing resemblance to the original songs from the LP's. If you are a Starbuck fan at all, you will be hurting them and yourself by buying this product.Instead, go to the artist's site at Moonlight Feels Right dot com, and buy the disc being sold by the original artist, instead of rewarding and encouraging thievery."
2,So far so good!,I've had this razor for a couple weeks now and can say that it's worked well so far. I haven't been as dedicated as I need to be in using it every day/every other day so it's tough to say how well it would work if I used it as I should. From what I've read it takes around a month for your face to get accustomed to the razor to get the cleanest shave so I'm going to give it more of an effort and hope it goes as well as I hope it will :) Overall I would recommend the razor after seeing what a good job it did with my 4 day old scruff. One thing I will say is be careful if you have a gotee. Mine got caught and it hurt a TON!
1,I keep looking for another Patterson thriller but this wasn't it,"A lot of loose ends abound, such as why the innocent victims were selected, how the master minds operated from solitary confinement in prison, and how all the evidence was fabricatedSince I gave four stars to the first three books in the Alex Cross series, I wonder if Patterson really wrote this book. This plot was simplistic, unbelievable and too pat.I have complained about all the white space in each of the eight books by Patterson that I have read, so I will just say that C. H Mitchum (Chelmsford, MA USA) posted a review on January 27, 2003 that captures my sentiments exactly."
1,Not Funny,"""Uses for a Dead Cat is NOT funny and promotes cruelty to cats. If you buy this or think its funny you need your 'head examined'.c"
2,Great carseat,"I love this car seat. We own a 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan (with stow and go), and a 2008 Dodge Ram truck, and it fits great in both. I love how it is not overly bulky - a HUGE plus. There are spots on the back to store everything, and this works well. I do not like how unnecessarily long the tether is. But that is my only complaint. We also own a Britax, and I like the Radian more, again mainly because of it not being bulky. My DS, who is 2, loves it. It is comfortable for him, and that is a big thing - he is 2 and 40 lbs. Anyone with bigger kids, I highly recommend this seat!"
1,not new cd's just a package of allready produced cd's,These were not newly produced cd's. They were a composition of cd's that had been put out before.
1,Please Don't Buy... SAFTEY HAZARD,"Hey, Please DON'T BUY if you have ANY KIND OF HILL! My mom was using it on a hill and guess what, Her Tractor FLIPPED because of the collector and luckily she ONLY BROKE HER ARM! The Troy-Built tractor is pretty much Totaled! The front fell off. The Deck wheels bend totally, and the Bagger is totaled fully! Please, DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF HILL!...So much of a $300 Birthday Present"
2,Great movie!,"My kids and I love it so much. All the pets are really cute and the story is interesting, too. Highly recommended."
1,Not worth the read..,This book is definitely not worth the read. It should be noted that it is written by an AT Kearney dude and as an ex-EDSer I can see the resemblance of the consultants that made all consultants look bad. It had no substance but choose to use big words and complex evolved scenarios to provide the pretence of intelligence. It is everything bad about a pompous consultant roled into a book. Please note that the positive reviews of this book are all from the Dallas / Fort Worth area which is home to the AT Kearney legions. I gave it a 2 only because all reading is positive and it started off good.
2,Really Comfortable!,These boxer briefs have an excellent fit and dry much quicker than other types of underwear. Definitely recommend . . .
1,What was Quinn thinking?,"Or WAS he?!? I had to read the sequal to this book for a class last semester, however, it was very thought provoking. . . i.e. I never thought it was going to end.The Prof. was pitched the class at the last minute and this was on the agenda. Luckily, she finished before we did and was so unimpressed that we didn't even have to take the test!This book is to positive solutions as twinkies are to bicycle repair. If you really want to feel ecologically progressive, buy a book on solar power! Take a walk! Plant a tree! Just don't sit on your butt wasting time on this book when you could be DOING something about the problem!!!"
1,Spalding Batting Tee,The actual advertisement in Amazon stated it included bases - apparently they no longer are included. The tee broke after 15 minutes of hitting! Piece of junk.
1,Not to be recommended,"This is definitely not a CD anyone could use for an Italian wedding. It was obviously mass produced and hastily put together. The songs are badly recorded and, above all, there is no life in the music. And you need life to pull off an Italian wedding successfully without a live band. Thumbs down."
2,"Great toaster, the whole family loves it.",This is a great toaster. It has a push button to toast if it's room temp. or if it's frozen. It is simple to use. The kids cook small pizzas with the push of a button. It toasts the bread perfectly. It cooks leftovers great. You won't be dissapointed.
2,Great product,"I really enjoyed this tea! My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for two years an had been unsuccessful until recently. I can't say that the the tea was the one that did it but maybe it helped because we are now expecting. I'm 6 weeks pregnant and I started drinking the tea two weeks ago. If you are trying I think that you should give it a try, it doesn't hurt. :) good luck and many blessings to all."
2,"everything you wanted to know about the Runaways, but was afraid to ask","better than i expected, that said i really really wish Joan Jett could have contributed to this film. it was never really explained but anyway it was cool to see the indepth interviews especially with Lita- she's great, but Joan is my favorite.i had no idea that kim fowley was such a freak. anyway for those who are interested in the founders of girl punk/rock. this is it!i gave 4 stars instead of 5 cause Joan wasnt interviewed."
2,Love is amazing,I totally love this new CD by Love. Hole fans should enjoy this as well as any regular Courtney fans. The lyrics are great and each song is carefully crafted. I say 5 stars for a great solo debut.
1,Save your money!!!!,"This is a terrible product. The bowl spins and the beaters do not. It broke after about 6 months of light use. The motor burned out mixing cookie dough.It was a gift so I do not have a receipt to have it replaced or fixed,"
2,romance and happy ending,the best adaption of jane eyre i've seenthe actors were perfect in their roles
2,refreshingly positive view of business,"Mr. Pascarella is able, in this book to let the working man and woman know that there are people setting atop large corporations who not only live their lives according to sound,ethical principles, but also conduct business according to the Golden Rule. The book is written in an interesting and easily understood format. Thank you Perry for the reasearch and the work..."
2,Any Judy Blume book,"I loved them all! How to Eat Fried Worms and Blubber and Are You There God, It's Me Margaret were my fav's!"
1,Big Disappointment,"We purchased this book for our moms' Bible study group and are very disappointed by this book's peppy, shallow nature. For example, the chapters on Sarah's remarkable faith fail to mention Hagar and Ishmael. We will be abandoning our study of this book for one with a more complex and in depth discussion of the triumphs, struggles, and failures of women in the Bible"
1,waste of time,"I love Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't wait to find out what became of Elizabeth and Darcy. If you want to read about the 101 ways they had sex go ahead and read this book. BORING, DULL, REPETITIVE...."
2,sorry.....,"This is the REAL last thing, ""There's A Lifting"" is a beautiful worship track with great musicianship. C ya"
1,Average to the extreme,"Perhaps if this movie was a mini series,it could have worked. I would hold nothing agains the director or script writer, because I think anyone who has read the book will agree with me on my next point:The novel was too much to cram into just a few hours.It caught the minor details that the novel portrayed of four children locked away in an attic for years, but on the other hand skipped major milestones in the story. For this reason, the characters lacked depth that the novel allowed to be seen, the relationships were not as believable and the plot seemed just far fetched. But if you have nothing better to do, go for it."
1,Not much use if can't hook up to a compressor,"Does anyone know where I can buy a 3/8"" NPT male with a 1/4"" Series Coupling for this Hitachi air nailer?The nailer arrived a month ago and we still haven't used it due to fact we can't find the 3/8"" air fitting. Would it have cost Hitachi a lot of money if they had just sold the nailer with one installed? I would have gladly paid $10.00-20.00 for them to do so. I'll bet I'm not the only one with this problem as everywhere I look they have 1/4"" NPT male or 3/8"" NPT male with a hose clamp fitting."
2,Great Overview of Why Railroads have come back from the dead,"Railroads Triumphant has given me an excellent history as to why railroads died, and why they are coming back. The author's explanation of the various forms of governmental intervention and how they led to the railroad's demise were enlightening. The Stagger's Act of 1980 clearly was the defining moment when the government stopped micro-managing the railroads and allowed them to serve the public again. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who thinks that railroading is dead! I also reccomend it to anyone who thinks that governmental control is good for the public.."
2,harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban,I like the book Harry Potter cause I like wizard cause have power. Harry is a powerful wizard and smart and quick at fling.Harry is a good but he has lots of problems and even Harry has learn all the things and he a good person.
1,Expected something else...,"I expected this to be the character background music from the series, but it was not, and was not up to the quality of the music from the show... very disappointing."
1,very poor sound quality,"The sound quality is extremely disappointing compared to the old JVC micro system it's replacing.(sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.)"
1,The devil is in the details,"The problem with this book is that it covers various SQL dialects, but don't tell you how to convert between them. Because of this basic flaw the book falls flat on its face as far as I'm concerned."
1,Waste of Money,"From day 1 this iron took forever to heat up. On top of that, the boast of 'no drip' was completely untrue. It drips, drips, drips and sometimes the steam works and sometimes not. If you're into self abuse, buy it. If not, get any other."
1,Wow! I blew my money on this????,"Calling Neil Gaiman... Calling Neil Gaiman.... Where is Neil Gaiman? After reading much of Neil Gaiman's work, I seem to have stumbled upon what has to have been one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker and many others have a knack for writing that makes you want to take the day off work just to keep reading. However, this novel was predictable, dull, and devoid of all characteristics that would make most of us want to keep reading.It has been some time since I have been compelled to write a review of a book, but I hope that this review can save even just one more person from wasting their time and money. Do yourself a favour and pick up ANY of Neil Gaiman's other work (WHICH IS FABULOUS I MUST SAY!), but leave this on the bookseller's shelf to collect dust rather than your own. They should give these away free!"
1,Forbidden City- Begiuin and Morel book bad for the money,"I was disappointed at the size of the book for the price. I've seen as the same, and as good historic photographs, on a bigger and better scale. Being in the printing business, I don't believe you take a maginificant picture and put it on the fold. Stupid for so so-called authors Beguin and Morel. Shame, shame, shame. Good subject, very bad presentation."
1,They should have kept this one on the vault shelf.....,"Someone should educate 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment about classic movies. Just because a movie is old, doesn't make it a classic, and certainly doesn't justify a DVD release.Fox is sitting on hundreds of great unreleased films, while they end up releasing junk like BORN TO BE BAD. A more accurate title would be FILMED TO BE BAD. Dull and boring (in a poor transfer), this is a waste of time and money."
2,A wonderful learning tool,"I have had the Kindle 2 for about 2 weeks and I have really enjoyed it. I have been reading a lot more than I have in the past, more rapidly and 2 or 3 books at a time.I have used the Read to Me feature which I have also enjoyed. The voice needs a little work because it will state quotes and it is a little mechanical, BUT it is amazing. I like the fact that you can choose a male or female voice.I have enjoyed the Kindle and I say this is a great option for people who like to read but have run out of shelf space. If I wanted a new book. I had to sell others from my collection to make room for the new editions. I also like the fact that not all of the books are $9.99. Once you purchase the Kindle and get over the sticker shock then it is nice to get a book for $0.99.Overall a wonderful product and I hope to own this one for years to come!"
2,"Nonfiction, but reads like a novel","The U.S. Was once an innovative, commercial, seafaring nation. I've been wondering what happened, when and why. This book explains the entrepreneurial spirit that was alive in the 1700's and how the U.S. shipping industry changed through to the late 20th Century. I wish the author would update the book for the past 15 years. I rarely read nonfiction as it fails to capture my imagination, but this little book does. Kudos to the author."
1,Great if you don't want to see behind you.,This shade blocks almost all visibility out the back window. The suction cups don't stay up very well either.
2,"Almost 2 years old now, best printer I have ever owned.....","I purchased this printer to use for my small part time photography hobby/business as well as for text printing of worksheets for our homeschool. After 2 years it has flawlessly printed more than 3000 8 1/2 x 11 photo sheets as well as at least 1500 paper sheets(worksheets/documents ect...). My pictures(using HP premium plus photo paper in satin/soft gloss) come out better than any local stores prints. And unlike other Hp printers I have had in the past, this one does not jam paper or ""get a mind of it's own"". It is suprisingly not too bad on ink. The scan feature is nice also for scanning negatives and old slides, it works well. I have used the fax a couple times and had no issues. All around a fantastic printer, I would(and will) buy it again."
1,Extremely Displeased,"This unit has died unexplicitly. We have replaced numerous batteries and the unit refuses to work. After reading some of the other reviews (albeit too late), I guess I feel a bit gratified because the unit worked for 68 days instead of just one week. I have made repeated phone calls to customer service and have yet to speak to a person. I am simply told to leave my name and number and someone will contact me. The call has not come. Summary: I regret buying this product (Christmas present for my son) and I will most likely not purchase other Memorex products, even their tapes...this experience has left a sour taste in my mouth."
2,An amazing book about how women get equal rights with men,"Elizabeth Cady would always speak her mind if she thought something was wrong. She was a bit of a tomboy, and thought she would be able to do the things that boys did as a child. Then, as she got older, she relized that women's right's were not equal to men's rights. When she was old enough, she got married to Henry Stanton and Became Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She decided that since she had a little more freedom, she would go around, discussing the about this problem. She started doing protest speeches about it, too. Henry Stanton thought she took it way too far and decided to move out. Being that she had three boys, she was a single mom, struggling to spread her word about this and still trying to take care of them.This book is very interesting and shows how a women could do this. I believe that if females keep strong, there will soon be a women president. Read on.............--Chenda Anne Bunkasem"
1,Not recommended for BlackBerry,"To start, other than the pulsing blue light - I love everything about this headset. I really tried to make it work. I bought both the black version Verizon puts out as well as the gray version from Best Buy. In both cases, I could not hear. The person on the other end could hear me fine but I could barely hear them. I tried everything to remedey but to no avail.The guy that the store told me that they are not rated to work with the BlackBerry products. Oh well - maybe with the next model."
2,Great Product!,"I've been using this product for many years now. My dermatologist recommended it to me and I'm glad she did. I have sensitive skin and this does a nice job of exfoliating my skin without causing irritation. It is pricey, but it does last a long time. My husband uses it, too, and it doesn't irritate his rosacea. That's impressive! I highly recommend it!"
2,Easy to use and fairly comprehensive,"I actually picked up Hawaiian fairly easy with this book and tape. I'm fairly proficient in learning languages (German, Spanish, French) so that may help. The background information and context exercises really help."
2,Dirty deeds sung rock strong,"I haven't heard the original Australian release, but the international version of ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" looks superior; the cover art's definitely better. As for the record itself, they aren't the Stones, but they sure like showing that they have the stones--and they show us, alright, from the rowdy-backwoods-bar-on-Saturday-night title anthem to the deliciously class-hostile ""Big Balls."" It fizzles a bit on Side Two, but things end right with ""Squealer."" These guys take genuine pleasure in sinning just because they are born with the freedom to do so, and at the end of the record all I can think is that, despite the objections of my moral center, they sure make doing so seem admirable."
1,Keyboard DOA,My computer recognized the keyboard and installed drivers and listed it as working properly. However nothing on the keyboard would work. Also the power indicator light came on for a few seconds when plugged in and then went out. I have windows 7 and I have tried to use it on 2 different computers and recieved the same results.
2,Andy Rooney Rocks!,Grew up listening to Andy Rooney on 60 minutes every Sunday night. I had forgotten many of the quirky ways he presented real life and said the things we all have said or wanted to say. Well worth the cost.
2,Mobilizing Gun Sniper,"The Gun Sniper.I really like this model. I have bought two of them. It should take you about a half hour to fully assembel it (this includes the decals).The reason I got two is because I want to have one fthat looks like Leena Tauros's and one that looks like Naiomi Flugel's. I have already painted my Naiomi Gun Sniper Red , it loks pretty cool actully, just remember to take it apart before you paint it..As for Leena's I still need the following parts..1 Wild Weasel Unit2 Dark Horn Gattling Guns2 Dark horn Launcher units4 Dibison missle podsshesh I need to save my money..I recommend this Zoid to anny one who likes zoids or Mecha.I am going to get another one for my Bday, just because I like it so much.. maybe I will paint it black (good song) and put the Shadow fox's gattiling gun on its back. If It is ever released that is.. ..."
2,Free Wearlink Strap,"Great product! I love my Polar FT4; however, I wish that it came with a strap that had more of an adjustment. I am a large guy and was very uncomfortable wearing this strap. As I told the Polar customer service person on the live chat...""the strap rolls on my rolls."" LOL I kept having to adjust the strap in the middle of boot camp and spinning classes. I felt like a high school girl on prom night pulling up her strapless dress the whole night. Anyway I digress, after chatting with the Polar representative and asking if they had a larger strap or extender, she just asked me for my address and said she would mail me a larger strap at no charge. I love Polar products you always get what you pay for, buy a good product and it will pay for itself in the long run with great quality and great customer service."
1,Love GO AWAY!!!Please,"Alright now Larenz Tate is an excellent actor, but this movie is not worth applying towards his credits. The story line could have been good, but the way they unfolded this story line was boring!!!!!!Deborah Cox is an extraodinary singer and the little bits that you hear in this movie is the best part of the movie. Now this should have been a made for t.v. movie, because the little nude scenes could have been omitted and the few cuss words were not necessary either. I wish Larenz Tate had scrapped this movie and went back to the drawing board and started over. Sorry, not a good dvd."
2,Storage Rack,The storage rack was smaller than I expected but very sturdy and ended up being the right size for the space I placed it in. It is very easy to put together. One person can do it and no tools needed. It is a great item and would buy it again if I need another one.
2,I Loved This Book.......,I loved this book because I love books about people's lives that are earthy and real and deal with hard times. Please read Random Passage first by the same author. The two books together are wonderful and are connected historically. If you only read Random Passage you will be like a person that has a sip of water and dying of thirst. A lot of unanswered questions that this book ties up.If you ever read the book The Shipping News I think you will like this book also. But read Random Passage first. Please.
1,Hey Read My Negative Rolling Stones Review.,"It is a huge joke that the Rolling Stones could make more than 20 albums in 40 years and each one of their albums suck horribly ever since 1964. They only made two good songs 'Start Me Up' and 'Shattered' and the rest of their songs stink! Their vocalist Mick Thornten wears his hair like a mohawk just can't sing at all and uses makeup like a girl. Keith Richmond, their guitar player is the worst guitar player in the world ever who never took guitar lessons doesn't know any of the chords,always out of tune and only two strings on his pink guitar. Willie Whatts,their drummer cant drum at all never took lessons and he was no comparison to drum greats like Lars Ulrich. Do not buy any Rolling Stones CD,they are the worst band ever besides Pink Floyd. Put Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones albums in the freezer. Mark Knopfler is 10 times better, get the Ragpicker's Dream insted."
1,Can adversity lead to peace?,"I did not like Prisoner's Wife and I did not dislike the book. While it had no redeeming message for me, I cannot say that Ms. Bandele's experience is invalid because it is not my experience.As I read, I kept a sad feeling because she appeared to be defined by so many negative life circumstances (ie, sex abuse, drug abuse, abortion, prison experiences, etc.) I guess she wanted to let the reader know her love for Mr. Rasheed was her empowerment, but, I could not tell if she found peace at the end of the book."
2,comfortable and clear,comfortable and clear view with a nice shade tint. i wear them driving for work so i don't ruin my good sunglasses.
1,Less than meets the eye.,"Games should be challenging. Humor should be funny. This book is neither. When the revolution comes, someone must answer for this."
1,Whoops,"Whoops, I just wasted 13 bucks. These guys suck! Maybe one of the worst records I have heard in a long time. Think Lit with some back country. If you like the single, that's all you'll like. Don't waste your money...you'll soon forget about them."
2,What a joy!!!,"This is a MUST for Africans and Lovers of African music! It's not only the marvellous work of Paul Simon,but of other artists,specially Myriam Makeba and the FABULOUS Ladysmith Black Mambazo. You feel the love,and almost...the smell of Africa!"
2,mario kart,"first of if u have read any of the other reviews nocking this game dont listen.they say the ai is hard?that it takes 200 hours to unlock everthing?on the contery, the ai is unfortunately a bit to easy and its too easy to unlock everything.BUT this game was made for multiplayer and its the best multiplayer game available on the 'cube.you just have to practice.if you and your mates are fairly similar in ability on this game, the ai is more of an anoyance, as you and your mate battle it out with seconds to go and the a computer lobs a blue shell just as your mate hits a bannana.he recovers more quickly and takes the checkered flag.this kind of thing is a regualar ocurance in this game and thats what makes it great................................Matt Clough"
2,Core only?,"Although I read this book and must say, it was more than enough info for the core module. I thought it lacked the material on the Windows/dos module for the exam that I just took and passed. There are only two chapters devoted to windows and a whole chapter for Windows NT, that was not even on the exam! Know your way around explorer and device manager for the windows/dos exam! Being that windows 95 covers about 75% of the exam,I found that a good Windows 95 book for the MCSE exam is the ultimate way for passing the windows exam."
1,We must remove this book for our School's,"This book sits on a shelf in my son's school, for any child to read.....maybe for a Highschool Teenager but not for Elementary School children....My 10 year old son brought this book home to read from his school and all that day he kept telling me that it has bad words in it, so after he went to sleep, I stayed up to read it and by the time I was done reading it, I was so upset I didn't sleep all that night. This is the worst childrens book I have ever come across......so now it makes me wonder how many other books there are out there like 'Crazy Lady' and we wonder why kids act the way they do now a days.....Geeeez!! look what they give them to read.........Thank You, from one very upset mom in Florida................."
1,Rip off artist,"This album should be boycotted by real hip hop heads//before biggie comes back from the dead//and puts this buster in a hospital bed....For ya'll that don't know G Black hasn't always sounded like biggie. He just recently switched his flow up(check his mixtapes from two years ago). He jacked BIG's entire style from rap to clothes to video's, and that beat he jacked for his ""hit"" single compton is from a classic dancehall song from over 10 years ago. He's a biter plain and simple....pick up Wordsworth ""Mirror Music"" or Jean Grae ""This Week"" for some real HIP HOP, or if yous a youngin grab some BIGGIE and call it a day!"
2,"""when my time comes to go, is on fire Bluegrass""","When I hear this group many thoughts of the late Bill & Charlie Monroe, The Delmore Brothers, The Carter Family, Hanks Williams and Jimmie Rodgers...early Country & Bluegrass shades of Gospel give us a whole new reason for living.Remember some of their earlier works ~ ""Letter To Home""...""Living on the Other Side""(outstanding album, possibly their best to date)...""Live at the Mac""...""John & Mary""...all the mentioned released on Rounder Records, and this ""Back To The Mac"", all feature the Lester Flatt & Earl Scrugg's test of time.Relive those days when ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" shined through, and every day was sunny, regardless of how much money you had in your pocket...music was your recreation, a stress reliver...it works today as it did then...so sit back, spin this CD and ENJOY!Total Time: 48:46 on 19 Tracks ~ Rounder Records 11661-0487-2 ~ (2001)"
2,For newbies and gurus alike!,"Alan Pringle and Sarah O'Keefe have provided an excellent introduction to the field of technical writing. For those just starting out in the field, you'll understand precisely what you will face. For those who have been around awhile, you'll find nuggets of inspiration and true-to-life humor that will help you face another day.As a tried and true technical writer, I found the chapters on ""Getting Information,"" ""Editors -- Resistance is Futile,"" and ""Indexing"" to be excellent explanations of key parts of the technical writing process. Technical Writing 101 is well-written, summarizes the technical writing process with appropriate technical detail, and is enjoyable to read! You can't go wrong with a text like this!"
2,Great product,This is a great product. It is very easly to use and has a great scent. After use my face did look and feel refresh and tight. I would recommend to anyone who has tired dull skin to give this a try.
1,"Order for ""Cat Who....."" gift items","AMAZON WEB PAGE SCREW-UPI tried 3 times to have a gift sent and failed. Each time after entering the name and address of the gift receipent in the SHIP TO column the order web page ""auto corrected"" the shipping address to the billing address. FRUSTRATING! The 'gift' is being sent to me. I'll now have to mail it to the intended gift receiver--extra work, extra cost, delayed Christmas present, extra time for failed attempts. I have been pleased with Amazon service in the past. Not the time, AMAZON FAILED!!!"
2,Underneath You Know The Names Is Genius,This song makes me cry over and over and over again.I love this band....like Mew's Comforting sounds. It's genius!
2,Crosley songwriter cd recorder,Produces supurb sound quality CD's from records and tapes--very easy to use! Attractive compact unit. Great for anyone who wants to reproduce records and tapes economically. Speedy delivery service. Highly recommend!!
2,Captured my attention . . .,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Once I got past the misleading synopsis on back of the novel and accepted the novel for what it really was, I became intensely involved. Roger Williams and Vivian Twostar are stereotypes, which is the point. They are cariactures; Dorris and Erdrich having a little fun with the stereotypes people have placed on them. The depth of character found in Erdrich's other novels is clearing missing; however, _The Crown of Columbus_ is a different kind of novel. It is a modern romance, detective, adventure, and historical novel at the same time. I recommend this book to someone looking for an entertaining read; anyone seeking high literature should read Erdrich's _Tracks_"
1,The money driven purpose,"Complete and utter pile of religious tosh. The only ""purpose"" this book serves is to line the wallet of Rick Warren. Its repetitive drivel. How to completely enslave your mind to a doctrine. Rick Warren doesnt live in the real world.But like all scam-preachers, the real world to them is how much money can they fleece their audience by. Avoid this book."
2,"i heard it,..but uhh where are the song titles","it was an outstanding cd, i personality wish i had my own copy of it, well i really enjoyed it so keep up the good work"
2,Helps with transition,"Having a new sibling can be confusing and frustrating. This book helps to answer questions children might have like ""When can my baby brother play with me?"" ""Why does he cry so much?"", etc. It presents it well so that kids can understand and it can allay some of their fears. My niece really enjoyed this book when her little brother was born, I think my mom read it to her 10 times in one day."
2,Hallelujah!!!! We'll Finally Have 'Em All!!!,"In the first place, I am so glad that Fox has finally come to their senses and released Lost In Space on DVD. We have waited long enough for our show, but our big disappointment has been that there are no extra features - (no interviews, no outtakes, no behind the scenes stories, not even a photo gallery of the actors - especially Guy Williams, he is why I watch the show).While the writing was more intelligent in the first season, I believe that the show would have been much better if the producers and writing revolved around the adults more instead of ""Danger, Danger, Will Robinson"", 'Dr. Smith' and 'The Robot'.Season 3 - 'Great Vegetable Rebellion', guess the actors needed the money (How Embarrassing)!!The overall quality of the DVDs are very good. I don't notice any 'Ghosts' or 'Shadows', just wish they included more special features.Rose ParkerCharlotte, NC"
2,Amazing,I do not know how someone can not like this series. If they rate it less than 5 stars they are obviously stupid and ignorant to good shows.
2,Great to learn from,"I think this book is great, I think that it does just cover the basics, I have been weight lifting for years and have a mild background in training and I learned somethings from this book. It is solid for learning some good basics plus a little more."
1,See the Sci-fi Channel version instead.,"David Lynch's dune is a monumental mess. The novel's fabulous story is now incomprehensible, and the film's poor editing and unwise choice of scenes to adapt makes the film feel choppy and unfocused. The special effects are terrible, the idea of a weirding module is hilariously bad, and the battle scenes are so poorly filmed, you'd think you were watching an Italian spaghetti western (actually, it's arguable action scenes in those were better). So see the 2000 sci-fi channel rendition instead, which unfolds in a captivating, enthralling manner."
2,Found Fried Maine Clams,"Here in Texas I can get Maine clams and Lobster, but not the fried clams. The ones I got from Great Gourmet are pretty close to the ""hidden"" clam shacks of NE. When I can't get to NE, these will sure fit the bill.The service was excellent. I recommend this company highly."
2,great show,"love the show, although this is season and the last one were the ones where they ""jumped the shark."" still had to watch it though!!"
1,"Should be called ""Advertisements for Kids"" ... where is the Geography?","I ordered this magazine for my son expecting the same level of quality articles as National Geographic Magazine has but, written at a kids level. After seeing two issues full of advertisements pushing things like: junk food, Video Games and Movies and even a review of video games, I am cancelling the subscription. This magazine is very disappointing and not at all up to expectations. All parents should cancel and send a message to the owners of this junk magazine that is doing nothing more than pushing advertising on our kids. Stick to a high quality magazine like National Wildlife's Ranger Rick."
2,The eternity of Beethoven,"Listen Bernstein ahead of one of the best orchestras in the world is pleasure, contemplation and time of profound inner journey before what is great and eternal.I recommend all people sensitive to music and also to those who will not be able to stop listening to Beethoven"
2,My little 4lb man loves dragging this around!,My Maltese likes cloth toys that he can play tug with and drag around. He loves this and after more than a year it still looks new!
2,The Duke falls for the Redhead!,"Hey, do you like John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara movies? Then why are you wasting your time reading this? Just buy it! This movie is a must have for your ""Duke"" collection. Yeah, the basic ideas for husband/wife are on the non-pc side. But, consider when it is set and when it was made. My mother is the one who got me hooked on this little gem when I was a kid (uh, because of the conflict between husband and brother-in-law..if I say anymore I'll give it away..don't want to do that!). The fortitude of Wayne and the spunk of O'Hara have made this a favorite of mine since the 4th grade! And when it is all over you'll watch it again and again...........then you'll find yourself humming that crazy little tune later in the day."
1,Very disappointed,"This is a great phone if you like to buy new phones every few months. The half-life of mine was 7 months. It was actually great up until that point. One day I answered it and the caller couldn't hear me; they hung-up thinking no one was there. From then on, it was unusable. This phone didn't even live through its warranty. This is the second time I got burned by a GE product; never again."
1,Blahhhhhh,"Okay, here are the main flaws;BoringBad graphicsBad sound effectsHorrible musicWAY too hardImpossible-to-remember passwordsI love Spongebob but this is just plain dumb. They switched A and B around; usually B is to shoot and A is to jump but here it's A to shoot and B to jump, so it's easy to get confused. It's also real old(It's for gameboy color)so I guess that's why it's boring. And the people in it talk like this: ""hi spongebob"" or ""okay fine take it"" or ""hi spongebob"" or ""no you cant be hall moniter"" or hi spongebob"". It's incredibly boring. Hope the newer games are better."
2,Two dogs and works well,Works as advertised. Particularly good while training. I can quickly reward dogs since my hands are free. Easily adjustable leads.
1,Cornwell Definitely At Risk,"First and foremost, I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK. And I'll not read it based on the reviews posted here and my reading of her last Scarpetta debacle, ""Predator."" I do believe Cornwell has lost her touch. Case in point, her last two Scarpetta offerings, while fairly well-written and suspenseful through the majority of the books, the endings were simply anti-climatic and bordering on farcical. I think it time that Ms. Cornwell take a break, read reviews such as these & take them to heart, and go back to her literary roots that made her an outstanding author. I only hope she can do so as for now, she's been removed from my 'must read' list."
1,Not Worth Buying,"I wish I'd rented this movie instead of buying it. I was looking forward to watching a beautiful love story unfold between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Yes, there's a huge age difference between the two in this film but the romance between them was not totally unbelievable. It just wasn't very inspiring. And the entire movie wasn't very interesting or fun to watch."
2,So glad I found this product!,"Several years ago I was prescribed a medicine that not only made my hair fall out but thinned the actual hair itself. As my hair was to my waist and quite thick this was devasting to me. When I attempted a ponytail even bands for children fell out. I was left with a smaller than a dime size ponytail. Thanks to this product my ponytail is almost back to a quarter size in circumference. From the roots to my eyes is all the new growth from this product. Mind you that is about one years' time. However, without it I would be stuck with the dime sized ponytail. It has been worth the wait. It is not an overnight fix but then nothing is. Try it!"
2,Incredible,"This album is incredible. It's the best CD I own. The songs are exquisite, the lyrics are beautiful, and it's just as good at background noise as it is at a dance club. It's great."
2,True ICP,This cd IS ICP. This is what they are all about. If this is not even in theory supposed to be they're best work than we are in for a treat come the 6th Jokers card. This CD has it all. All the heavy beats that you would expect from ICP. no tinkerbell beats or lyrics. This is realhardcore rap. ICP is not afraid to break hip hop boundaries and i think that is why there music is so fresh.
2,Good up until the ending,"Our family liked the action in the movie, except for at the ending of the movie. We liked the special effects. -The End"
2,"Yummy, and ""more healthier"" as my kids would say","We love these!Beware, though, the warehouse is sending out the wrong amount. You should get 3.3 pounds of product. That's 6 boxes of 6 packets. If you get a single box, email or call Amazon!Annie's Mac and Cheese is also GREAT - both the single serve and the different flavor boxes.Enjoy!"
2,All of the Curwood books are forgotten classics,A Mountie from his deathbed confesses to a crime in order to protect the actual killer -- then recovers & must face the possibility he may hang. The resulting struggle for life & honor provides one of the great classic adventures of the Royal Mounted Police in the Canadian Northwest & the far-frozen North
2,For Greater Glory,"Amazon.com, thank you for your expeditious delivery of For Greater Glory. I have viewed it three times and each time I learn more about life in Mexcio and the United States in the 1920s. I found the story well done. The plot moved well. I strongly suggest that viewers view all the credits. Some call it violent, because people do die violently but without all an over-abundance of gore and blood. I did not think it too violent even for junior high teens. If allows one's imagination to work. I recommend it. It has a good story and a good message. Dave Vincent"
2,Epic..!,"This shirt is fabtabulous. So much so that it autonomously wrote it into all copies of the dictionary. It took some time before I got used to all the marriage proposals but there is no way in hell I could ever go without this shirt now. I was already pretty confident but this shirt made me absolutely sure I am awesome! I'm thinking of getting the long sleeve to increase the effective area.Since I purchased this shirt:- Have folded time and space- ABSORBED a black hole (three Wolf-Power vacuum is superior)- Found Waldo- Solved my Rubik's cube in 5.4 seconds (Would have been 4 even if I wasn't distracted by the awesome moon on my shirt)- Simply walked into Mordor (I mean who wouldn't let you in with a shirt like this??)- Won the lottery- Divided by zero- Found the meaning of life (if you're wondering, it's ""Awroooooo!!!!"")I can't even begin to rave about this shirt honestly. I'm considering having it surgically grafted to my body for a more permanent solution. I'm so happy! AWROOOOOO!"
2,THISS ISS DAAAAAA BOOOOMB!,"I think this is a great movie contrary to some. People say DiC cut it up pretty bad as well as all the rest. I cant say much about that because I've never seen the original Anime,because we didnt have a computer till a few months ago,so I never new you could get the original Anime.Anyway I thought this movie was DAA BOOOMB!"
1,Doesn't scratch the surface,The book was well organized but did not even scratch the surface of any technical topic. Most of the info was on how to click on the user interface. The labs are for beginners and do not prepare you for real adminitrtion. This is a beginners book at best. Most of the material in the book was not on the Cert test. This book will not help anyone preparing for MCSE.
2,Fast paced and entertaining,"This was a fast paced, entertaining book. It was hard at the beginning to keep all the characters straight, I found myself referring back to previous chapters. However, the characters are developed at a good pace, just enough to keep wanting for more at the end of each chapter. The lead characters are interesting and intriguing in revealing their back stories. All in all a good read, definitely worth your time."
1,Dont buy this guys,"I brought this item couple of weeks back, i have tried with various mp3 but there is no signal at alllllll"
2,More than adequate for non professional use,"How many cars do you have in your household? Any motorcycles, boat, lawn tractor, generator, golf cart, anything else with a big battery? This tool is not appropriate for small batteries, but anything that needs to power a starter motor or a pump can be checked and you know for certain if the battery needs replacing or you might have another problem. As such it will pay for itself rather quickly. Easy to use, clear instructions, looks very robust."
1,And the story is...,"It would appear that Mr. Jordan is letting the Wheel of Time go 'round and 'round. It's time to either change the wheel or let it come full circle. It's been fun and exciting, but this one has a few broken spokes. I must agree with previous readers...it's not what I had expected and I'm truly disappointed that there wasn't some conclusion to any of the mini-dramas. Even the ending was so so."
1,This is a really bad book,"Making your way through this book is a difficult process that requires a great deal of patience and probably a dictionary. Unfortunately, the awards are few, made apparent when you realize the points that the author tries hard to obfuscate are superficial. Not only is the writing style nearly impossible to get through, the book lacks any deep analysis of culture or economics. The visual tools that the author uses to illustrate his theories are made up of huge oversimplifications of international economies."
2,Its worth every penny!,"Well its cute, dosent take up too much space, and my baby loves it at 6mnths. My son loves it when i put it on his tray he plays on it i only see him sitting up playing with it later, its a great buy, and not too expensive!Oh p.s. they dont say this but you should really watch your kid and not let them fall asleep on this it is plastic and could form to the shape of their face i do not reccomend leaving a sleeping baby on it or near it, just saying not a water bed. I have a friend..... I know some people...."
2,Great Avery product - as usual,"You know the feeling... after you get used to using a product for a long time...the manufacturer either discontinues it or takes a few shortcuts to cut costs and it just doesn't work like it used to??I get that feeling a lot. BUT, not with Avery products. It is one brand that I feel I can trust to deliver a quality product time after time.The clear labels were no exception. They work great and look good."
1,Christian movie??? ...Far from it.,"There are many things about this movie that is just downright blasphemous.For example...Joshua(Jesus),plays pool at a tavern.Then after he beats his opponent,he tells him ""You suck at pool"".Jesus would NEVER tell somebody this! Saying somebody ""sucks"" at something,is a crude reference to oral sex.In another scene,it shows a woman who's nipples are poking through her blouse.It is VERY clear,that she is not wearing a bra.This is an invitation,to temptation,amongst men who view this.I could go on and on.This is NOT a Christian-friendly,or a family-friendly movie at all.Christians:Stay far away from this filth.It's a shame that Third Day would appear in this God-less movie.I used to really like them."
2,Rescue Ranger to the rescue,The original shipment of the DVD Rescue Heroes arrived with no disc in the box. I was amazed at the promptness of the vendor in correcting this problem and then the follow up to make sure I was satisfied with the product and service. This is so untypical of the customer service we as consumers receive from most companies. I would give Amazon and the company that actually shipped the DVD 6 stars if I could. My grandson loved the DVD and plays it over and over.
2,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the best DVD I have ever seen in my life. The performence was great, the crowd was great, everything was great. Although, the reason I am giving this DVD 4 stars and not 5 is because the amps for james and micks guitars were to quiet. But other than that it was great. My words of wisdome are...just buy the DVD, I have no other comments."
2,This is the one that started it all.,"This is the first one in a series that really started the entire fantasy craze. The Hobbit and the subsequent Lord of the Ring Series really launched an entire generation of Fantasy readers. I loved this book as well as the books that followed. While this is more light hearted than the ones that follow, it certainly is just as great as the others."
2,One to Read and Reread,"There are few books I never like to be separated from; this is one. As of this writing, I own it in audio (a constant companion on my iPod), on Kindle, and in paperback. When friends ask for recommendations of spiritual books, this is at the top of my list.All that is surprising, as I generally dislike New Age writing. I find it tends to be smug, preachy, and assertive rather than persuasive. But this book is highly persuasive and highly engaging. Chopra offers compelling frameworks for thinking about issues, but puts full responsibility on the reader; he offers suggestions for integrating his insights into one's life, but avoids the nagging To Do lists that mar the works of people like Dyer.Of course it won't speak to everyone. Nothing can. But do your self a favor and give it a try. It may change your life for the better."
2,Fast paced thriller!,I could not read fast enough. It grabs you and puts you right in the middle. This was right along the lines of Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code; a book you just don't want to stop reading. I found it very interesting that I could look up the locations in which are referred to in the book and get a better visualization of the images so brilliantly written of throughout the novel. This made the book that much more intense! It is a must read!
1,misrepresented waste of time,Total piece of junk. A grown up flick w/kids thrown in the mixso parents blow 50 bucks at the movies. Had my two kids not beenthere w/me I would've walked out after 20mins. And demanded mymoney back'
1,Description is wrong,"This is the listed Product Description:Make your work life E-Zier! Quality-built, premium steel unit has a strong steel frame, shelves and dividers with a solid fiberboard back. Interlocking design of the shelves and dividers add extra strength to hold up to the heaviest load. Wide shelf fronts serve as generous label holders. Unit features 72 letter-sized compartments. Each compartment will hold up to 750 sheets.Scroll up and read the specifications published directly above the product description. It says it's made out of wood.Houston, we gotta' problem. (reason why I gave it one star. The actual product, made out of wood and which I bought a month ago, is great.)"
2,Van louvre,"Installed the van louvre's this weekend on my 99 Ford van and they fit perfect. The price was great compared to other places I looked at the same identical product. Installation was not bad but you have to be sure the mounting clips are in the correct position, once they touch the glass they definatly do stick. The items were shipped very quickly and well packaged."
1,Not useful.,"Unless you're going to use these for something other than table tennis, stay away. These are cheap mass produced balls... But they don't behave at all like a table tennis ball, not even good enough for practice. To be fair, it says practice and they're cheap, I should have known better."
2,Great for storytimes!,"I am a children's librarian at a small public library, and I used this book during my ""silly stories"" week. The repetitive structure and clear, colorful illustrations make this a good one for sharing with a group."
1,A disappointing curiousity,"What started off as an interesting insight into the process of a well respected filmmaker working with students in a true master class process dissolved quickly into a rambling discussion about anything but the process of cinematography.Sure there were moments of hope when Lassally would touch on an element of framing or composition but then he would ""wax poetic"" about things that, I'm sure were important to him at the time but, were hardly relevant to what is pitched as the intent of the film: cinematography.From an aesthetic point of view, the images of the rock sculptures that populate the film have a symbolic meaning...perhaps. But from a practical perspective where one would want to expose students to the thought processes of a master filmmaker practicing his craft, this film was a disappointment."
2,Worth reading for the ending - don't tell how it ends!!!,"A little slow getting started. The abuse and sexaul description are more graphic then I care for - but close your eyes to them and read on. It is worth reading. The ending will knock your socks off. Six Ladies at work have read ""the book"" with the understanding you can not talk to anyone about the ending that has not read ""the book"". We all thought it was Great*****"
2,An Excellent Book,"I found this book to be exceptionally good at cutting through the baloney that we so often find ourselves confronted with, and helps to set us in the right direction. I recommend this to anyone who wants to succeed in business -- whatever it may be."
2,Lady Killer!!!!,"Gentlemen!!! my review title says it all, I had tested this beauty in a shopping mall last month...n finally got it yesterday..guyz u got to believe me, this is one of d best EDT's out there..sure a lady killer..get urs soon..here in India this is available for 1200RS(24 USD)"
2,Thought provoking reality check,"Goal oriented woman realizes just in time that who she thought she wanted to be with was a tool, and she ends up with someone who loves her as much as she loves him."
2,TOTALY PLEASED,"I was very impressed by this chain. Actually, it was a lot nicer than I had expected. I couldn't have been more satisfied with the chain AND the price. i bought this for my wife and she was totaly pleased with the size and the large clasp. i would reccomend this chain for its beauty and ease of use, her pendants slide on nicely and she wears it daily.thanks again for a great productjohn muoio"
2,Together for the First Time,"When someone attempts to kill him Jim Chee goes to his new partner Joe Leaphorn. Three murders are similar to the attack on Chee. Tony Hillerman brings his two Navaho detectives together for the first time in an uneasy alliance, SKINWALKERS. Total opposites the two explore their heritage of witches (skinwalkers) in a fast paced police procedural sure to keep you turning the pages.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
2,amazing !,I love mama mio oil. my baby is 2weeks old now im almost back to my pregnancy weight and have not even 1streatchmark. i was using mama mio from 4th months of pregnancy and loved it
1,You Have to be Kidding? Who are these pianists?,"The sound was terrible. This was not the F&T pianists I had the privilege of seeing and hearing years ago. One piece sounded like my grandson pounding on the base keys, no melody could be decifered! Very disappointing recording or else it wasn't Mr. F and Mr. T! The music sounded better on the RealPlayer sample than on the CD I purchased. Very poor sound control."
1,Returned twice....,"I was not satisfied with this product, no fault of Amazon, but from the manufacturer. When i received it and opened it up, there was a residue on the clear plastic front of the rainforest soother. I tried to clean it off(couldn't really tell if it was on the outside of the plastic front or inside) but it would not come off. I shipped it back to Amazon and within days they had a replacement out to me. But, on the replacement, it had the same issue, so i mailed it back again and Amazon promptly refunded me. I ended up finding this toy at a local store(although at a higher price) that did not have the residue on it. So, while i'm unhappy with having to go through the trouble of returning it twice, Amazon did a good job getting me a replacement then a refund very quickly. The Rainforest soother is great-i bought it for one of my twins(the other has the fisher price aquarium) and he LOVES it!!"
1,Shame on the fakers,"My rating for The Rockville Slayer would have been a 2.5 stars or around there. I'm farily new to Amazon reviews but even I could tell that most (or all) of the 5 star reviews here are fakes. There's so much refrence to how great the director or the script is and how great the film is that it's all just got to be done by friends or family or even the director himself. How dumb does he think we all are? But anyway, the movie isn't that bad. It has some good parts and there's even a modicum of suspense here and there. But beware: the movie breaks down, literally, about 3/4 way into it, the sound goes off and you watch the last part of the movie like a bad Japanese children's monster film with the voices, sounds and lip movements all way off. Anyone who gave this 5 stars and didn't mention this is a big phoney. I like Linnea Quigley and Robert Zdar is always creepy. They aren't great in this avg. film but they always lend a good b movie air to things."
1,LaCie Rugged 80 gig triple interface,"Bought in June 2006 and got it installed without too much problem.Every 2 months or so hooked it up to Dell Inspiron 9100 for file back ups.The 1st and 2nd times I did this I had to re-start computer or do something again to get its icon on the laptop to transfer data. The 3rd time in March 2007, I hooked it up, the external drive got hot and never connected to the laptop. I will NEVER purchase another LaCie product; NEVER had these problems with an HP external hard drive. Moral;buy HP external drives and SHORT lac.pa ! Nuff said. Who has time for this !"
2,I like this book.,"This is an easy book to read.Mr Rankin has written this book from his unique perspective of Theater, Philosophy, and Sales. He is, of course, also a very successful businessman. He has provided us an insight into the interrelationships of these disciplines, and the tools to use them.The reader doesn't need to be an experienced sales professional to enjoy and benefit from this book. Although the book is easy to read, it is also full of good ideas that experienced businesspeople can learn.Don't be scared off by my review. The book is well written, and besides providing us with tools to live with - it is a good story."
2,garage indie nerds got nuthin on this,"yeah, its sloppy. yeah, the entire band sounds out of it. yeah at times its even unlistenable. but only on a few big star cuts does alex chilton tap the primal spirit of rock and roll as he does consistently on this disc. standouts are my rival, hook or crook, ive had it and the title cut. this version has extra tracks my old cd dont have and if they're anything like the other 10 cuts, you've got a true bonus. i dont even CARE if you don't like it, I like it"
2,Tongue Fu Packs a Powerful Punch!,"As an executive coach and communications trainer, I am always on the lookout for excellent resources for my clients. Tongue Fu! is a winner! The book is easy-to-read and hard to put down. Unlike other books that are all talk but are thin on tools and tactics, Tongue Fu! provides real-world examples that any level of excectuve can use to immediately improve their day-to-day communications. The ""words to use,"" and ""words to lose,"" examples are especially helpful. My clients have let me know again and again that this book packs a powerful punch."
1,zoom does not capture image clearly,"It's cheap, and works that way. It's ok for a couple basic photos, but anything up close will not work."
2,BUY THIS,"The first ep on the tape deserves a 5 star in itself! It's very emotional and sad. However, it loses a star because I HATE the english singing voice for Priss. IT REALLY BAD!"
1,Not for a Mac,"I have used a Kensington turbo mouse for years, but no more. Kensington has not updated their software to work with Mac OS X 10.7, and the mouse is worthless without it.In addition, my Expert Mouse came with a very stiff and difficult to use trackball, so even if the software had been usable I would have sent it back."
2,Great Beginning to Wealth Building,"If you like reading an informative book that teaches rather than preaches, this book is for you.I expected Kim to tell me the steps she took to start investing in real estate, along with the pros and cons, but she went one step better. She sidestepped the stiff, one-person approach in favor of educating me through the eyes and stories of a multi-women reunion.You find yourself trying to identify with one of the women, but even if you cannot, you quickly and easily learn wealth-building steps throughout the chapters. Some situations seem extraneous, but that made sense, too, because life doesn't stop while you learn the ins and outs of real estate buying.If you're ready to build wealth through real estate, you'll keep reading to the end. And then, if you're serious about moving forward, you'll be motivated to proceed just like Kim."
2,Good lite reading,"It wasn't exactly what I expected to read, but I found the story interesting and fun to escape into.Would have been even better with more technical info and historical background of the hedge fund business and derivatives markets in Asia."
2,BOO!,"This was a pretty good film which was similar to BEETLEJUICE. I love that song at the end (Don't fear the reaper, by The Mutton Birds) Overall a clever plot and brilliant special F/X."
2,Excellent,"Alarm Clock continues with the ideas on Richie Haven'sMixed Bag: take good popular songs, and apply Richie's vocals and madman strumming.This is a little more guitar geared than Bag, and is not the tight folk-pop masterpiece that album is , but it is still a great album.Absurdly, Havens' albums from this era are hard to get or out of print, only available on pricey imports. More absurdly, people now think of him as ""the guy who opened Woodstock.""But back in their time, these were important for kids into folk rock, expecially African American one's who connected to the genre through Richie, and were regulars if not staples on early FM radio.There is no good reason all his albums from 1967-72 should not be in print."
2,IT'S NOT A WAR MOVIE!,"If you want to see a war movie then rent one. Also, this is not a documentary. It's a movie, not a factual account of anything. If you don't appreciate Chapter 1 of this movie then you have no appreciation of great acting, brilliant dialogue and great film making. True, a lot of unnecessary gore but gore is always a part of Tarantino's movies and you should expect that before you watch it."
2,El espíritu de Beethoven,"De las muchas grabaciones de la sonata ""Claro de Luna"", esta es una de las más equilibradas y coherentes que he escuhado. Un lírico primer movimiento, unido a un fogoso tercero, hacen de esta lectura una puerta al mundo de Beethoven, por un pianista inteligente y comprometido. Sale muy bien parado de la la competencia (Arrau - excelente 1er mov -, Kempff, Ashkenbzi). En la N 4, es contagioso,y en la op 27 n1, es misterioso y sabe mantener la tensión. Un poco de resonancia en la grabación, pero no es tan importante. Una hermosa grabación"
2,omg u r soo true,"omg i read what the person from Agoura Hills said about this cd and thats exactly what i think every timei listen to it i'm not saying this is a bad cd, i happent o be a fan but those guys need to think about there lyrics more"
1,Douglas Lacks Original Insight,"Much like most books on serial killers, Douglas covers already known information on a popular topic. If you're looking for information on a few cases, it may be of help, but it provides little new information to an already hot topic."
2,Fantasy perfected,"Okay, it may not be perfect literature, but it is perfect childrens fantasy. The originality of the cats and other animals and the nightworld they know of has been unjustly neglected. You may have trouble finding the books, but read them if you do!"
1,Litter Pan,"The item arrived late, but it arrived. I did have to write Ozbo (the company) to remind them to ship it, and upon replying they had not shipped it. They promised that it would arrive on time, but it didn't. I suppose you should hope that your item isn't anything valuable that might break, since they don't package items well. Other than that, the product was fine and as advertised. I am giving it two stars for the service, not for the product."
1,Obvious Question,How can there be class differences between the kids if they live in a nation that's been communist for over 60 years? Wasn't the whole point of La Revolucion to do away with those kinds of distinctions?
2,amazingness,"This machine is by far one of the easiest machines to use. Not to mention that the cleaning is a breeze. I go my closest Bed Bath and Beyond and buy coffee, which they have a great assortment always in stock and the coupons save me money. NO SHIPPING. I would recommend this machine over any regular coffee pot any day of the week."
2,A Stab at Brevity,"Like Thomas Mann, I have been accused of prolixity. Sadly, for me, Tom and I have only this alleged vice in common, for I claim none of his virtues. I will try to be brief, then, as penance for past sins._Magic Mountain_ is my favorite novel, because it is inexhaustible in the way that great art always is.Also, I am in love with Madame Chauchat, for though I know that she is named after a machine gun, when I see her name, I always think of ""warm kitty,"" or something like.Despite its longueurs, _Magic Mountain_ is a snappy read, I think, and I may yet change my name, here deep in my dotage, to Peeperkorn. We all go some time, after all: why not go spicy and big?"
1,Scratchy--doesn't feel like 440 thread count!,"These sheets are more scratchy than other 440 thread count sheets I have had. These sheets feel more like 200 thread count. Even after washing, the sheets are still rough. I ordered the color Saddle, and it is a few shades darker than what appears in the picture."
1,PC VS XBOX on couter-strike,"Ok, so heres the deal. If you own a pc, have a fast internet connection, and have a mouse, not a touchpad for your PC, go and buy counter-strike for PC, belive me it is way better. If you don't have a PC and still want to buy counter-stike, go and buy Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3, it is way better than counter-stike for Xbox. If your still not satisfied go get cstrike for Xbox. THIS GAME IS A DIFFERENT AND WORSE GAME ON XBOX. i love it on PC, hate it on Xbox. I bought it all happy that I had bought cstike on Xbox but then played it for 10 minutes, turned off my xbox, took out the game and I haven't played cstrike on Xbox for 3 months now, not a good game at all."
1,"Once fully charged, won't hold charge for any length of time.","Ok, I figure, being a Lenmar brand, the battery should hold a charge,but it doesn't.I figure I'll give it a complete charge and discharge a few times and a month to determine how reliable the battery is, before any reviews.After you fully charge it, it will work, but don't expect same power length as your original.Also, if you have it fully charge and let it sit for a week, without use, the battery will show empty, when you try to play it.So if you are going to use it, you must charge it the night before. Kind of a pain.One note, to replace the battery was pretty easy, just watch the videos online, took about 10min."
2,Plano is still the greatest.,"I was looking for a box to use as my field box for R/C airplanes and this box has been perfect. Anyone that is into the R/C airplane hobby knows you have a million little parts and pieces along with special tools, glues and lubricants. I am amazed at how much gear I can stuff in this thing! The side compartment w/ the small divider boxes was perfect for my small screws sets. I have had many storage type boxes but this is one of the few that was easy to fill and continuously use. Other boxes just never seemed to fit my needs. I have been using this for 3 years, it has held up very well and I couldn't be happier. Thanks again Plano."
2,Awsome glasses!!!,"I bought these glasses (along with the Waring Pro ice crusher) for my wife's birthday after she told me ,while we were at a Stewart's Rootbeer stand, how as a child she and her family had an ice crusher and how she loves frosted mugs. So, I looked around online and found these glasses. They're really great. There isn't an annoying seam (like I've read on other mug reviews) and they're nice and thick. They arrived in perfect condition with no chips or cracks. And, you can't beat the price. I highly recomend them. These glasses(frosted) + crushed ice + Sterwart's rootbeer = total happiness!"
1,Best Part,"The best part of this book was the last page, as I knew it was OVER.I have always liked this writer, and her books. We have a 'gaming magazine' here- nothing more- oh- not to forget a murderer who considers shooting over a dozen people near the end.It was wall to wall video games, a murder with a mouse cord, and karate moves, and a buzzard.There were no leaping loons, however-unless you consider the entire cast of this book.If I were a video person, perhaps I would have liked it better. I am happy to say it was a library book~ no money spent here."
1,Horrid!,"FX is way too stuck in the ""Nam"" mode with this piece of trash. I love that guy lighting up a joint at the motor pool, I thought for sure some Jefferson Airplane was gonna kick in. I won't even begin to start on the stereotypes that are supposed to be characters. This was clearly written by some boomers who've ingested way too many Vietnam flicks. I'm sure guys who've actually been to Iraq ""love"" this show's ""attention to detail"". The flag on the IED is a nice example. If you thought Cop Rock was a good show about law enforcement, you'll love this!"
1,"Skimpy, overpriced and overhyped. NOT A TURNON.","The author tries hard to convince you of his ""tantric"" credentials. Maybe then you will believe he knows something about sex that you didn't figure out for yourself at the age of 15. Warmed over hippie era hype at its worst."
2,Canon WP-DC2 Waterproof Case,"This is an easy case to use. The only deficiency it has is shared with most other waterproof cases: there is no pressure release to make opening the case easy under all temperature conditions.Other than that, we are happy with the two of these that I purchased."
2,Original and Outstanding,"Everytime I hear this CD it takes my breath away. The last track ""Ojos Asi"" is a fabulous blend of latin and arabic influence."
2,Amazing,This movie offers an amazing and stunning view of a totalitarian society in the future. Wesley snipes does a great job at playing the villain. The story is told with a comedic twist that makes it so enjoyable to watch.
2,"Hey, What A Concept!","Rachael Ray delivers yet again! Before she was a Food Network favorite, this hard working former server and PR genius wrote up a number of recipes for genuinely appealing meals that could be prepared in a half-hour or less. She used to go to supermarkets and do demonstrations and sell her books that way. She's earned her current status as one of America's favorite cooking personalities and this book shows why. Unlike so many cookbooks, everything in here is kitchen-tested, it works, and it's absolutely worth the time it takes to make. Rachael Ray has kept food preparation simple and she really goes the extra mile in passing on her time saving tips on how to prepare fine meals in today's hurried world. This is a fabulous book and I recommend it without qualification!"
2,A must-have for every pilot,I got this book just a month prior to sitting for my IFR Rating exam.I had other books but this illustrated me!I seriously reccommend it.
2,One Hell of an album,"Buy it! Simple as that. This album is very dynamic... melodic, rockin and punishing."
1,The second book was much better,"I read first El Reino del Dragon de Oro and I like that book very much, then I read this one and the first part is very good, but the second half of the book is just boring, when Alex and Nadia went with the natives and they want to make you feel that they live better than any civilization is just pathetic, and I won't tell anything about the ""invisible Nadia"" the last 100 pages could be written in 50 or less pages. If I read first this book I would never read the second one."
1,Noise Noise Noiise,"Purchased this 4port after using the 2 port for a long time. However, I can't even use the audio jacks because it creates a high pitch sound that irritates and won't go away. It is in the box itself. While this is enough to negate the function of the audio plugs, to add to this problem the kvm apparently still passes noise coming from some peripheral that wasn't there before. I am going back to my 2 port and just deal with the physical changing of cables."
1,Why buy this when you can have the original?,I don't understand. Why buy this version by Janet Schulman when you can have the original written by Felix Salten himself? Is Salten's version out of copyright? Is someone else trying to make money off of it?
2,"I like it, except...","The mouse is great, very sensitive. It's nice to use in Photoshop. The five programable buttons work well and are easy to program.The keyboard works fine. I like the zoom slide and calculator button. This keyboard has more features than I am likely to use, but I am a gadget junkie.The only things I have a beef about are lack of a light on the caps lock key, (I often hunt and peck and I sometimes type all caps). I realize a cap lock indicator would be a battery drain. Occasionaly, a window pops up to tell me the mouse is out of range or low on power. When I check the mouse application, all is well. My last complaint is a matter of taste... I am tired of silver plastic. It's the fake woodgrain of the new century. It's about as tasteful as Courtney Love at the Pope's ordination.The keys are worse than the silver board. They are a translucent grey. Roboturd grey? I am happy with the functionality of this keyboard but it makes me think of the ugly kid down the street."
2,Very informative,This book has given me a window in understanding how and why a liar lies. It has helped me gaina clearer picture of what it si that I am dealing with.
2,A Meistersinger to end all other Meistersingers!,"Karajan's live '51 recording under the direction of Walter Legge is truly a testament to Art herself.Perfection and Excellence are the mottos of this historic performance.The intensity Karajan brings to the score is overwhelming..just listen to the overture for instance!The sound is in wonderful mono...better than Naxos's recent re-issue or that of Uarania. Unfortunately this set is discontinued from EMI, and only comes with the German libretto. Nevertheless, what is most interesting in hearing this set is the ""dramatic through line"" which is rarely captured on record, but is self-evident and vivid thanks to Karajan.A fantastic display piece is you ever find it used. You will fall in love with Meistersinger all over again listening to this recording."
2,Great Book!,This book was so amazing! I loved it... it truly took you away and plopped you right in the middle of the story! I was so sad that it ended and then I found 'Swimming Lessons'... what a gift!
2,Rappin and Rhymin,"An Excellent Childrens Video, My children loved it and now my grand-children are learning it too, From Numbers to ABC's and all done in a music, fun format. It has been great for them, They will play it over and over, that is why I am ordering another. I have worn out 2 of them already. They play it constantly."
2,LOVE IT!!,Had one - lost it - thought I'd die.....looked everywhere and finally found it here....no one who uses garlic in cooking should be without this litttle gadget.
1,Disappointing,After reading his earlier books this one was a real disappointment. The plotline was not very convincing. It appears that Mills has a contract to produce a book per year. This one felt forced. Stick with the earlier ones especially Sphere of Influence.
1,POOR CONSTRUCTION,"I just ordered this machine and in assembly, a hole on the machine did not align with a hole on the part to which it was to be secured. The 2 holes are 1/4"" apart. Unable to get any customer service from HOOVER, who did not even include an 800 number. Called long distance, phone rang then just stopped. Will never buy HOOVER again - customer service is non-existent. I'm returning it immediately. I would rate it no star but have to check one star to get this review shown."
2,We are all loved.,We enjoyed this book very much. I think it has a good moral to tell. The humans only have of the truth and really begin to worship it and fight over it. Eventually a small child finds the other truth and unites them all. I have it recommended for grades K-3rd but I would recommend it for all ages.
2,Sushi your way,Gave the book as a gift to a sushi enthusiast and they gave it high praise. They are excited about trying some of the examples.
1,a disappointing bore,"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
2,"Fantastic, inspiring -- an amazaing book!","David Bornstein captures the spirit, determination and passion of social entrepreneurs from all around the globe.I was especially delighted to read about my friend and mentor Bill Drayton, of the Ashoka Foundation. I met Bill in Rio de Janeiro in 1989. During our meeting Bill introduced me to Ashoka, and the stories of the social entrepreneurs they supported. It was my introduction to this wonderful world of committed people.Bill Drayton encouraged me to create my own foundation, and for many years it supported Ashoka Fellows world wide. David Bornstein has encapsulated for me the world of Social Entrepreneurs and their ""Power of New Ideas"" in a vivid and dramatic manner -- more so even than my personal visits to my Ashoka Fellows ever did.This is a powerful read!Joe MillerThe Joseph F Miller Foundationhttp://jfmillerfoundation.org/"
2,this was good,i really this book whoops because it focused on wonderful characters and has a very creative title that fits the book well.
2,A glimpse of reality!,"I just want to say a special thaks to Lorenzo, for his confrontation and courage in writing the book. I hope the very best for him, n hope he remains in tranquility!"
1,waste of money,I bought this months ago for my 10 yr old. He couldn't wait to get it. We did exactly what the directions asked us to do. We saw one to two of these hatch and then they were dead within 24 hours. My son kept checking for the other ones to hatch but they never did. He was disappointed and I was disappointed in myself for spending money on this product.
1,Paris Big Tex Holster Set,It is a well put together toy but has some defects in the firing mechanism. The clip that holds the barrel and cylinder for the caps in place is made of plastic and can come loose quiet easily. Also the lever to advance to the next cap sometimes jams.
2,Was Great Series,"This was a great series, Great Acting and and a very good Script. It kept you interested , Should have never been cancelled."
2,Delius' Champion,"British composer Frederick Delius basically owes his legacy to conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In fact my introduction to Delius came via Beecham's disc in EMI's ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series. This Sony import title captures TB in mono performances from 1950-55 of Delius works not included in that aforementioned EMI CD. Here he leads his Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the fantasy overture ""Over the Hills and Far Away,"" ""Sea Drift"" for baritone, chorus and orchestra, featuring text by Walt Whitman, and ""Paris (The Song of a Great City)."" Many classical music devotees dismiss Delius as a lightweight, but I find this music to be compelling if not absolutely essential. In all, another fine Beecham reissue from Sony UK."
1,Very shallow pop philosophy,"I tried very hard to like this book but was quickly turned off by Dr. Dyer's protrayal of ""low level"" and ""high level"" frequencies that supposedly mirror different qualitative levels of thought. From these essentially unsupported constructs, he provides advice for living as if the entire structure is an a priori given. The commentary is very shallow bordering upon new age pop psychology. I found very little depth in the first one hundred and twenty pages and finally gave up on the book. If you are interested in something much more substantial and helpful, study more well thought out Zen or Buddhist texts that provide much more substance but do a much better job of conveying the ideas that I believe Dr. Dyer is trying to share."
2,Better than OREO's,"I decided to start an organic diet. I started with Newman's cookies. Amazon had a sale, and I decided to give County Choice a chance.I am SOOOOOOOOO glad I did. I love them. They are better than OREO's."
2,great ARPG game ever,"this is probably the best game i've played for the longest time.the battle chest set comes with all the CDs for diablo 2 and also it comes with diablo 1, which i didnt really play before. but it should be a good game.it also comes with a lot of information about the products from blizzard, i think most people know what blizzard is.no more need to say,lets enjoy the game.oh,btw, the CD-KEYs really worked.lol.."
1,Not for the inexperienced woodworker,"This book has some nice patterns, however, the instructions are incomplete. Whenever a joint is not 90 degrees, or some shaping is required, the angles for mitering are incorrect, or just missing. You need to do some figuring and even experimenting to get them right, resulting in what can be a major waste of time and materials, or just accepting that the outcome will not be satisfactory."
2,GAP CREEK and THE TRUEST PLEASURE,I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read. I am now reading The Truest Pleasure. It is also by Robert Morgan. I plan on reading all his books. I love the way he writes. I have not been able to stop thinging about Julie and Hank. I felt like I knew them while reading the book. I am half way through The Truest Pleasure and can not forget Ginny and Hank. These are books that give you a great read.
2,it's time for a new world order,"After a lengthy hiatus spanning 8 years, the original synth-dance band from the UK is back with a smashing new single Crystal. If their contribution on The Beach soundtrack leaves you wanting more, you've got it here.The song is heavy on hooks and is extremely well-suited for that smashing dancefloor. Add a couple of those hi-energy dance remixes, you'll get a smash! Plus an incredible non-LP track..."
1,Clay Aiken will not be getting any this Christmas.,"Clay, Clay, Clay. Knock it off. Seriously, you are getting on America's nerves. You didn't win American Idol, and you don't deserve to release this album. What's really annoying is that there are only positive reviews of this album on Amazon.com. Hopefully Amazon.com won't censor the freedom of speech, and the freedom to let you know before you do a stupid thing, that this album is a disgrace to Music as we knew it. The only reason one should buy this album is to discourage someone else from buying by publicly setting it on fire or by letting your friends listen to it... a word of caution: listen near the toilet so you don't have far to go when you have to throw up."
2,A liitle campy but good,"This series from the 70s is about a group of young people who discover they are the next phase of human evolution. They are naturally telepathic, telekinetic and can teleport (jaunte). They are also in possession of an alien supercomputer ""TIM"" explicitly capable of original thought and a hideout with advanced technology. uThey also have the handicap of not being able to kill even in self defense. Despite this, they have numerous adventures with human and alien bad guys and have become the acknowledged (by the ""Galactic Federation"") autority of Earth though almost no one knows about them.I found the series enjoyable but a little campy. There is also a couple of points where the characters take actions which arguably are inconsistant with a prohibition on killing (like sabotaging a spacehip)."
1,hard to understand,I had trouble with this book. The instructions were hard to understand and the examples didn't start from the beginning. The action script was already done for you and there were bugs in some of them. Not for beginners! If you have none or even little knowledge of flash forget about his book. It's not for you!
1,What a disappointment!!,I bought this vacuum to replace one just like it that I had owned for two years. I returned the first replacement because it was impossible to use on rugs; the brush was too long and hung in the rug. The second replacement was the same so I returned it also. It looks like the quality control in these vacuums has disappeared. I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemy.
2,In My Nav-Kit Now,"I have sailed since I was a teenager [a LONG time ago].For most of those years, I was involved in navigating the boat/ship I was on.These days, I sail on Other People's Boats [OPBs].Hopefully, I am the navigator, since my days as a hand on the foredeck are long past.Sailing on various OPBs, I found that on-board navigation tools varied.I wanted a set of my own compass/dividers that I could bring to the boat....NOTE: [I also bring a chartbook, a GPS, and a W&P; Vectormaster]That set needed to be-- compact, but accurate. [These tools need to work.]-- in its own 'case' [don't want those divider points poking holes in my seabag -- to say nothing of my GPS].-- inexpensive enough that I didn't need to panic if I discover I left it on board after a race or passage.This set meets those criteria.IMO, it is the soft plastic 'case' that makes this work.A leather [cordura?] case would be even better, and worth paying more."
2,my review,"I received and have used my vacuum and am pretty happy with it except for the vacuum attachments. The attachment head provided with the Metro to vacuum the floor of my car sucks, there is no opening on the attachment fitting and there is so much sucking powerthat it's hard to pull it off the carpet, so I couldn't use it and had to resort to just the hose opening. The other thing is the length of the hose, it absolutely needs 3 more feet. Other wise I'm very happy with it, this vacuum has more suck power than you can imagine, maybe too much."
2,THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO!,"THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO! Be prepared to read the whole book once you start because you won't want to put it down until you finish it!I met Michelle Whitedove when she was doing research for this book at The Lodge in Cloudcroft, New Mexico where I work. I found her to be a very exciting and intriguing person.Ms Whitedove has the uncanny ability to include you in the saga as you travel with her, so that you experience what she experiences as she travels from California to Louisiana visiting famed ""haunted places"" in Ghost Stalker. In many places you can feel the hair on your neck stand up as you participate in the adventure!I am very honored that Ms Whitedove saw fit to include my non-fiction short story, ""The Unruly Guest on Friday the Thirteenth"" in Ghost Stalker."
1,Not pan & scan: Open matted,"... The film was initially shot in the academy ratio (full frame) as a tele-movie. When it's released in theatres it is matted. So the currently-available DVD should be showing the entire frame, not cropped.Still there's no excuse for Artisan's barebone tratement for the title. Not even a trailer is there! We waited so long for it to come out on DVD again and it must be one of the biggest disppointment of the year."
2,zoom h4,"I own the H2 and the H4 is a better machine though it is a bit harder to work the menus. The condensor mics get a better vocal sound than the H2. I record a quartet of eletric guitars, bass and percussion live, no P.A. and get a good sound for mp3s to put up on the net. Both are good but I wouldn't spend the extra if you don't need the cubase software."
2,Fantasitic,"This book basically lets you know everything you need to know about Arts Management. I'm currently taking a course in Arts Managment, not knowing what I'm getting myself into, and I love it! It's a fantastic resource and this book helped me by letting me know that Arts Management is what I want to do."
1,You can do better.,"Cheap, Too cheap actually, even by my standards. Couldn't see the numbers very well. Didn't even open two of them. I was too embarrassed to gift."
2,"The Other ""Must Have"" book for first time dog breeders","This is the best of the dog breeding books I bought when wanting to learn specifics about breeding my bitch. It gives time lines, what to expect when and also info on what to expect from the stud. I found this book to be very practical as it answered most of my breeding questions."
2,GREAT!!!,I bought one and my child hasn't put it down. He's taking a picture of me right now. It's very education and teaches your child the lesson responcibity and education to teach them how to use a camera. Duh! It's a great item and a must buy.
1,Just another crappy shock band,"All these guys get together and say ""lets scream for false reasons to get all the kiddies to buy our album"" These guys are so boring sounding. They look like an ad for addidas. come on people! The last straw was when the lead singer claimed that korn was the first band to combine rap and rock. EXCUSE MEEE!! I believe that run dmc was doing it back in the 80's. On top of that why are all korn's fans such jerks? I'm around a lot of these people and a lot of them I knew well and they are a bunch of sh** heads."
1,not what was promised,"This connector is sold as if it's at least equivalent to the Apple original equipment. However, if I use the phone when it's plugged in, it behaves oddly, doesn't respond appropriately, sometimes won't perform at all. The connector does recharge the phone, but it certainly doesn't have full functionality."
1,Last House on the Left,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, the storyline unbelievable and the production values zero!! Save your money!!"
2,Weaver 301,"The 301 is a fast and easy base to install. But it's strong, as needed on a Super Blackhawk. After shooting 20 rds. I check to see if shot lose. But it was still sound."
1,"nice case, useless tools","This sounds like a good idea, but it doesn't work. Inside the handsome case are a small test tube, a thermometer (defective in my case), and ""vinometer"", which is an oddly-shaped piece of glass that is supposed to (but doesn't) measure the alcohol content of liquids. As soon as you see this glass thingy, you'll think it implausible that such a thing could actually work, and I can assure you, after an hour of fussing with it, that it doesn't."
1,IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU NEVER SEE THIS!!!!!,"I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen!!"
2,Smurfs are back!,"This is a great smurf product! I ended up super gluing some of the small parts on so they didn't get lost. Overall it is cute and because the roof comes off, it makes a great place to store other smurfs!"
2,Excellent Material for both Kids and Adults,"I have read the first book in the Harry Potter series, the Sorcerer's Stone, and found it to be very entertaining and interesting. Before I have picked up the Sorcerer's Stone book, I have not read a novel for over twenty years. I believe that the other books in the Harry Potter series will be just as good as the first book. The Harry Potter series is highly recommended for adult reading."
1,Lots of fluff,"Not easy to understand. Sometimes it is difficult to follow what the author means. There is too much detail, which I feel was getting in the way of understanding CGI.I was initlally exicited , but after reading the first few chapters, i think i will have to look elsewhere."
1,"Misleading promotion, missed opportunity","RATING = * * 1/2Promotion for this film led us to believe it was a little mystery wrapped in a comedy. While a bit of both, it wasn't enough of either to give it the identity it needed. And that's a shame.Given the premise -- Anniston suspects she might be the love child of The Graduate's Ben Braddock -- this held a lot of potential. But once the jig was up, there was no place to go. We were left with under-developed characters and story lines that were shallow and incomplete. Opportunity lost.The likable Anniston has a few good turns and Costner delivers a solid performance, but even they couldn't fill-in the missing pieces. A-List stars and slick production alone do not a good movie make. At least not enough to fill 90 minutes or warrant a $10 ticket or $20 purchase."
2,Quick Delivery,Have not watched yet. Can't describe it until after it has been viewed. i will update at some later date.
2,Mody mostly to be in the histroy books some day.,I bought Mody's CD without not really know what kind of songs are on it. I just saw his music video on tv. Well this is the best CD i bougth since Fiona Apple's new one. The only thing it ran out of steam trowads the end. But finshed it was a great song. I think you should buy or use some eles' CD or Tape. So you can listen to Moby.
2,Scrutinizing the science,"With the mixed messages parents are getting on the issue of media violence and aggression, this book serves as an educative tool. We are usually treated to misleading sound-bites and talking points regarding the ""scientific studies"" the author evaluates. Like all science, these studies are not safe from scrutiny. There have been many poorly designed studies in this area and the author calls attention to them. I am dumbfounded by previous reviewers attempt to accuse this psychologist as someone trying to undermine psychology. For scientists: questioning one and anothers' research methods is part of the profession. This is how knowledge advances. The only insults to common sense I see are the studies that attempt to define aggressive behavior as popping a balloon, or thinking about violence after seeing violent movies.Good science can and should stand up to scrutiny. The fact is, psychology has been guilty of some bad science."
2,"Ordered a textbook, received a study guide","I bought this product used from an Amazon participating bookstore. I thought I was getting the textbook, but when it arrived it was the study guide. I think Amazon and/or the bookstore should be more careful to make sure that the customer gets what he orders and/or that the description on the website gives a proper representation of the product."
1,THE most awful movie!,"I give this move a NEGATIVE 5 rating. Could this movie have been anymore boring? Sure the acting was good - but again, how boring it was almost painful! I watched this movie with a large group who also felt the same way - what does that tell you? Very dreary."
1,I was made to feel that Ted Bundy was the victim,"This woman became a pawn in the twisted little world Bundy lived in. To think that he felt sorrow for anyone other than himself is a shame. Bundy was not a victim of some unjust system.The story goes on about how she was trying to save his life. How cruel it was to have him come so close to death only to get a stsy. I say nothing can compare to the fear and pain he caused. If you want your heart to bleed for poor old Ted read this book, if not read something by someone who helped put this devil away"
1,Warning: Don't be tempted by the low price!,"I purchased a GoVideo DVD Recorder +VCR a mere seven months ago, and it worked fine for a while, but then the DVD drive simply died. I tried calling the so-called ""help line"" but was put on hold for over 45 minutes. I finally gave up and wrote an e-mail, but I received only FAQ answers in return (none of which addressed my problem). I finally decided to cut my losses and junk the machine. If you buy this piece of junk, don't expect it to last, and when it breaks, don't expect any support. Save your money and get a better product."
2,"Let's Go, Robbie Race Car","If you enjoyed Little Clown Car's Big Day, you and your kids will certainly enjoy this interactive book. Half the fun is making sure your child 'toots' (squeezes) the horn at the right place while each of you read along. In the story Robbie Race Car #1 begins as the race strong and vibrant and finishes the race and learns what it means to be a REAL winner! If your children enjoy cars, they will certainly bring this book to you to read many times..."
1,Don't waste you're money,"This is the worst nonstick hard anodized pan I've ever owned. I have an Analon Titanium 8 in. skillet and Calphalon 12 in. hard anodized skillet, which are much better. I've also had Silverstone that's better than this pan. This pan is very tinny and thin, over heats easily on even low-med heat on an electric stove, the handles are thin, the lid is ill-fitting and way too heavy for the weight of the pan, and the metal surrounding the lid is curved inward and hard to get clean. I own a Cuisinart Multiclad Pro stainless set, which is excellent, and I wanted to try this before I spent more on the Multiclad Pro nonstick skillets. I'm really surprised at the low quality. I'm glad I tried it, now I know it's junk. Cuisinart should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on it."
1,Sound quality so horrible it's not worth listening to,I have to say I love George Acosta. The first time I listened to this album I thought there was something wrong with the cd. Eventually I figured out this was how the cd was actually produced. I have dj'd before and understand that some of my records might sound bad from wear and tear but I couldn't believe the horrible sounds coming from my speakers when playing this album. Get ANY of his other cd's besides this one!
1,Limited usefulness,"This product does not live up to its claims. It arrived at my home with a prominent dent in the front panel. Despite the damage, it did work, but not for every use that it is intended. It crushes ice sufficiently to be used in the bottoms of serving trays to keep food items cold, but does not even come close to crushing ice small enough to be used in frozen drinks."
2,Mississippi Fred McDowell @ His Best,"I own quite a few Fred McDowell C.D.'s and let me tell you this is his best on the Arhoolie & Fuel label his stuff doesn't feel as raw as this (no offense Fred) when I hear this C.D. Fred McDowell almost scares me I get chills down my back when I hear the songs ""Six White Horses""(which can only be found here), ""The Girl I'm Loving"", and ""Diving Duck Blues"" Fred McDowell is right up their or even above Son House & other Delta Bluesmen (yes I just went there) and when he pairs up with his wife Annie McDowell on ""Get Right Church"", ""Keep your Lamp Trimmed and Burning"" there right up there with Blind Willie Johnson and his wife Angeline Johnson. All right enough rambling trust me get this C.D. if your new to Fred McDowell or haven't got it yet, also after you buy this get ""Live at the GasLight""(thats a whole other story).p.s. Fred McDowell had been around just as long as Son House, Robert Johnson and others he was just never recorded until the early 60's."
1,not like they used to make them!,"my daughter received one of these for her birthday. the hair is aweful!!! i unwrapped the hair and it was so tangled. it took 30 minutes to comb it out, and so much hair fell out. it continues to fall out every time you bush. the make-up is so cheesy. all you do is apply water, and that doesn't even work half the time. given that my daughter is three, it makes no difference to her, but give me a break. i think it's a big waste of money!!!!"
1,Stick to any other,"This certainly is the worst Chili Peppers record EVER, I'm only givin' 2 stars because of By The Way, a good song among such terrible music. Where is Flea's amazing bass lines, John's solos which stick into you head for weeks and that funky style that only the RHCP had? You know what ? Try Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, One hot Minute or Mother's Milk and you shall have fun!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,POWDER. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF GOOD ABSORPTION CO Q 10 BEST WHEN NOT CRYSTALIZED. THE BEST IS CLEAR GEL. GAVE ONE STAR AS I COULD NOT GIVE LESS DUE TO AMAZON SETTINGS
2,"Overdue footage, well done","Finally, a DVD that shows ELO in their prime. How they rocked with that classical sound! Wait no longer my friends. THIS is the one to get. ELO steps up and leaves the excesses out [that later clouded their performances]. I hope this is the first of similar releases for one of my favorite 70's bands."
1,GROWING RAPIDLY,"and there were absolutely NO instructions included specifically for the Ginkgo Bonsai - most importantly when and how to prune, how large it will get, etc. None of these questions can be found in books either. Currently, it is 28"" tall which I consider rather tall for a bonsai I've had for less than 1 month but I don't know what to expect. The pot is pretty."
2,Great basic holster!,"Love this holster! Simple design, easy to use! Its also way cool that it comes with not just the belt attachment, but the paddle as well, which is super comfortable. I have an extended mag release on my Glock 22, and a lot of people complain that it rubs your side when the firearm is holstered... not true at all. This holster rocks! Cant beat Serpa CQC holsters!"
1,Worthless,"It's funny that I see two reviews that say the book is lousy, and several others that sound like a commercial. So, what's the truth? The truth is this book is little more than a pamphlet hyping the used car biz. It offers very little in terms of specifics. Those reviews praising the book as some sort of godsend were put there by the author. This book is filled with vague and very obvious information. I have found all the information in this book and more on the internet for free. DO NOT BUY!"
2,My Friends Love It,"Very unique watch, different in every way: power source, strap, etc. Many of friends have made positive comments about the watch--they just love it."
1,cute but not very good,"It looks cute, but the cute-factor no longer soothes my irritation when this product turns what should be a simple matter of slicing an egg into an ordeal. The product is difficult to clean and the metal wires just don't have enough tension in them to be able to cut the egg properly - they get pushed out of the way and seem so flimsy that I am amazed they have not snapped yet."
2,surprised,I had heard about how the movie displays how our healthcare system takes advantage of individuals that don't have healthcare. I was surprised to see this. It was very informative.
2,Great Game! Music Rocks!,"I don't know what was wrong with the other two reviewers of this game but I think it rocked. I'm not an avid game player myself but in my opinion the graphics, choices of current snowboarders, tricks and jumps - along with the music, made this game excellent. I'd recommend to anyone!"
1,It's for kids,"I bought it with a bunch of other books about cryptography (serious ones), but it is written for kids. One of the codes is a sentence with the words written backwards. Another is letters split up into blocks, but you can still just read the words straight across. It's really not helpful."
1,Culinary Crap,"Leaks, even with leak guard on. Grates well if you use a small amount of food at once, but forget it if you want to try to hash a couple of potatoes at once. You'll wind up with some potato mush and some potato chunks. And speaking of CHUNKS....the reason I really don't like this thing is because the slicer/shredder disk doesn't just shred, it slices all at the same time! If you want cheese shreds, be prepared for shred/chunks. The problem is that as the food passes between the shred holes on the disk, it slips down into the dull side of the slicer hole and slices at the same time! This is my first processor; maybe all of them with the reversible disk work this way. I know processors are supposed to be multi-taskes, but only when you want them to be. Geesh! This one's going back to the store."
2,Inspiring book on how to accessorize,"This is one of my favorite decorating books in my library.I wish Christi would write another book on this subject (or any decorating subject!) Her photos are simply exquisite. Also, this book is easy to follow.This book shows how to accessorize in a ""semi-formal"" way. Christi takes the reader through every room in (any) house and shows ,for instance, how to hang pictures, or place objects in an appealing manner, or use colors, etc...."
2,Good back-up light,"I have four of these and I use them on my house. The flashlight is of a useful brightness and the emergency light aspect is excellent on a region where power sometimes goes out at night.The plug is not polarized, so you can point the night light portion up or down, and I do both. The plug position is such that the light covers both power outlets if you have an inline 2 power outlets faceplate, thus rendering the other power outlet useless. This is the only reason I did not give a 5-star review."
2,the Ultimate Collection Is the Ultimate!,"Even though it says 3 seasons it is the ENTIRE COMPLETE SERIES!!!!!i AM A PAUL GROSS ADDICT AND THIS ROUNDED OUT MY COLLECTION OF HIS WORKS QUITE NICELYI'm disappointed that such fin acting is put on the cheapest easily damaged plastic disks Dvd's used to be on high quality polycarbonate if it scratched you could use a little Carbona dry cleaning spot treatment ruib it on and buff any scratches away. tjhat won't work any more because a german co. bought carbona and stopped making the dry cleaner spot treatment and are selling their mediocre enzyme treatments instead so handle with care.I didnt seat a disk properly and it played but now 2 episodes are ruined becauise it rubbed the loading tray as it played and therre are really deep scratches otherwise A+ for good solid entertainment without simulated sex scenes and gratuitous violence Youll love Benton Frasier and Diefenbacher, his deaf wolf, and their escapades!"
1,I'm sorry I watched it.,"I guess with Steve Carrel in it, I was expecting / hoping for some comedic twist. And, early on, there was some, like the meeting at work, looking to replace suddenly available positions in his company - ""Any one want to be CFO?"" I kept watching hoping for some kind of miraculous turn around, but nope - Earth is vaporized. And two people that finally found love get to share about three minutes. I found it too sad to call entertainment.One redeeming thing - I did find myself thinking about how lucky I am to be with the ones I love."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Worked for about 12 hours. Now..... doesn't work at all. If you try to set it to the correct time, the numbers just keep jumping around, and not even in the correct order! Jumps from hour to minute and back again, all out of order. Just a little piece of junk. What a surprise."
2,"The lotion really helped my dry heels. However, ...","The lotion really helped my dry heels. However, it has an unusual odor, which is probably the menthol. My wife used it on her cracked hands, and it really improved them too. We live in a dry climate in Utah and our skin really takes a beating. I'd recommend this product to people with dry skin, if you don't mind the unusual aroma."
2,Great for massage or just pure relaxation.,One of my absolute favorite relaxation cd's. I am a massage therapist and receive so many compliments when I play this cd. Excellent mellow piano the whole way through.
2,Great Flashes,"I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Nikon flashes and I'm very happy with them. I have an SB600 that after 2 weeks of use and a light drop of less than 1 foot, had to go back to Nikon for a $120 repair. These Vivitars have been on my umbrella stands when they've blown over, hit the ground and come right back up to fire. I think for the $90 cost, you get a good amount of power with very good build quality. I only wish the recycle time was a bit faster, and that they had a 1/32 power, or even 1/8 power but they're analog at it's finest and I'm glad I got them."
1,REALLY DISAPPOINTING! ONE OF THE WORST MARVEL MOVIES,"remember buying the Amazing Spider-man issue that first features the Punisher. I was never a die hard fan,but certainly thought he was cool. I wanted to like this movie and thought it would be one of the better Marvel Comic films.......I was wrong! This movie was really bad and my 2 star rating is generous! I don't even know where to begin with what went wrong. They did not capture the dark,gritty essence of the comic book! The movie was almost laughable! I have not seen the director's cut yet,but I really don't think they can fix this one with some added scenes. If your a fan your gonna buy it any way,but I don't think it's worth the 1/2 inch space it takes on my DVD shelf!"
2,An unknown jewel of a performance!,"First of all, after all those Opera D'Oro recordings I've been listening to lately, this Orfeo recording has outstanding sound. The principals give their best; I was particularly impressed with Cotrubas, whom I associate with less full-blooded roles, and Francisco Araiza, in a rare foray ut of his usual Mozart/ Rossini repetoire. Bruson is perfection, as usual. Gardelli keeps things moving at a brisk pace. This is the only commercially recorded performance of this rare opera. I got it used and I am glad I did!"
2,CONFESSIONS A CLASSIC!,"What can I say Usher Confessions is a modern day classic R&B;/Pop album.It features top notch production from various top producers.It's a creative concept album.It has a great sound that stood the test of time,people still play songs from this album everywhere from sporting events to the clubs.You want a classic good album to listen to Usher Confessions is it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
2,I loved my Reebok Fitwatch until it stopped working...,"My Reebok Fitwatch was a great product for about 9 months until the screen stopped working properly and now it only displays gibberish. However, for 50 dollars, I think 9 months was still a good value. The watch is better for running than for biking because on a bike, it can be difficult to continue riding while pressing down the two buttons with one hand. I usually had to stop to take my heart rate while biking, but for running, it's perfect."
2,Excellent Ending,"The film was a little stale in the beginning, but by the end of the film, I completely adored it. The film happens to be chocked full of beautiful men, which doesn't hurt either. Brad Pitt and George Clooney do a great job as the center of the film, being the ring leaders. I happen to think that George Clooney steals the show. If you plan to watch the film, the ending makes the entire film worth it. I don't want to spoil it, but it's really, really good! Overall, the film gets a 4/5 because of the somewhat boring beginning."
2,Sybil does it well,"She came to fame with Don't make me over and the Stock/Aitken/Waterman hit When I'm good & Ready. Sybil has a good voice and usually also well written songs. Her albums are always quite enjoyable. Here you have another best of with remixes and some bonus tracks. If you want to get to know her, have a start with this :)"
1,leaky mess,Overall the product looks very nice but it didn't work well. The sealant that keeps the nectar from leaking was not placed right so after you fill the cylinder with nectar it leaked all over the counter. I would not purchase this product if I could go back. Now I need to put more sealant in order for it to work properly. Thumbs down.
2,Best Gluten Free White Bread Mix,"Although I would never confuse this bread with the real French Bread, it is by far, the best gluten free white bread that I have made - from mixes as well as from scratch. The mix is milk free - wonderful for those of us who have to avoid milk products. The texture of the bread is very close to traditional white bread made from wheat and does not become ""grainy"" even after several days in the freezer. I think it it's easy to make, whether by traditional oven method or in a bread machine. One of the very few bread mixes I highly recommend."
1,"Save your money, this is a flawed product.","Flawed prodeuct, sold on philips outlet for $19. USB 1.0 device. Flawed with errors.Save your time and frustration, don't buy."
1,Don't Buy,"Typical Chinese product, failed in less that 6 months. Seems to be bad connection between switch and lamp base. Contacted seller, NO RESPONSE."
2,Not your typical Witchcraft book thank the Gods!,"Evolutionary, revolutionary, and certainly not anything you would find in a Llewellyn book. Initiated into the Anderson Feri and Reclaiming traditions priestess T Thorn Coyle is a modern witch and teacher of witchcraft.T Thorn Coyle goes beyond your basic 101 magick book and gives her readers tools they can use to transform and revolutionize their lives. The idea that our humanity is where our magic lies has opened up avenues for myself that have made my vision of a life spent where every minute is spent in the sacred a reality. Her book can be ordered at www.powells.com or ask yourindependent bookseller to stock it."
2,"SMALL roasting pan, but good.","I wanted a pan which would fit in my kitchen sink, so that it would be easy to clean and I would be thus more likely to use it. Well, this is the pan. It cleans very easily due to the non-stick coating, and it is definitely broiler-safe, even on the top-rack. It is very small, at only 9x13. But that can be a benefit for couples or small families.Now all that's left is to see how it holds up over time..."
1,Liberals Destroy America,I can't believe books like this can even be published in America. Al Franken lies about the best people in America today. It's people like him that are causing the steady downfall of Christian morality in this country. I don't even have to read this book to know it is awful liberal garbage.
1,"Thick, Gluey Muck!","Don't let the beautiful cover fool you, this book contains dreadfully complex, dry text that confuses rather than enlightens. Unless you are enticed by topics such as, ""Interpreting the D/Log E Curve"" or ""Converting Log Density Ranges"" there are easily better choices. If you're looking for clarity - whether novice or advanced photography skill - buy Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure."" Its simplicity is effective and refreshing."
2,"Not ""Leather Bound""","This is an excellent missal, but it is bound in cheap plastic, not leather. I e-mailed Amazon about this, but they chose not to change the listing."
2,It sure was a good decision to buy this one!,"I had already owned Peter Gabriel's ""So"" and ""Us"" before I decided to get this fine collection of his solo material, some of which I was familiar with. Besides ""Sledgehammer"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Don't Give Up"", ""Red Rain"", and ""Big Time"" (Where's ""In Your Eyes"", anyway?), all from ""So"", my other favorites are ""Solsbury Hill"", ""I Don't Remember"", ""Shaking The Tree"" itself, ""San Jacinto"", the new-for-this-collection ""Here Comes The Flood"", the particularly strange and bizarre-lyric-filled ""Games Without Frontiers"", and my absolute favorite ""Shock The Monkey"", albeit in edited form, as opposed to the version I heard on the radio. So, now, beside fellow Genesis veteran Phil Collins' ""Hits"" CD, this is a must for anyone's adult-contemporary collection. I'd recommend it heavily!"
1,"OK she's funny, but very cynical & dangerously inaccurate.","This book is clever and after four births (everything from being knocked out to completely natural childbirth) I admit I recognized most of the experiences she describes. However, anyone with girlfriends like this should get birthing advice from somewhere else. Few women ever have a chance to do anything even half so important as giving birth to a child and they deserve far better support and advice than they get in this book. They should get the Birth Book by William and Martha Sears. Cynicism does not enhance a beautiful experience."
2,It's all about AMOR,"These songs really grabbed me -- I love Spanish songs and these were like poetry. Many of the songs revolve around love themes. Love, more love, lost love, obsessive love - it's all there. Y para los que hablan Espanol.....este es un album muy especial, con el tema del amor interpretado en una manera muy sofisticada. Este CD va a dar gusto, tanto a los hombres romanticos como yo, como a las damas que dominan nuestros corazones."
1,Very Abstract,"The book starts off strong with a thorough review of Euclid's constructions complete with explanations of the constructions themselves. Things go down rapidly from there.Most of the remainder of the book is a very abstract discussion of constructability under various conditions. After the first chapter there are very few concrete constructions performed.If you're looking for a discussion of the theoretical basis of geometric constructions under a variety of conditions this book is an excellent resource. If you're looking for practical, step-by-step constructions that go beyond Euclid you should look elsewhere."
2,It is always a pleasure to watch consumate craftspersons....,"...and nobody ever beat Burns and Allen at their craft. You get to see the first show of the TV series...and then other, too. Burns and Allen are and will always be a delight to watch.However, the producers of this collection deserve a swift kick to the nether regions. They give us FIVE dvds...each with just under 60 minutes on it. Would the world come to an end if theyput TWO HOURS on each dvd...and saved us some space on our overcrowded dvd storage units? Then we could by another collection from them with a decent ammount of data per disc. I guess I am a funny guy. I love Burns and Allen, and I hate being sold empty space."
2,fun!,"This is so neat, its not as long as it looks in the picture.The sound it makes is pretty, it sounds like a running faucet when you are in the other room and could be useful for potty training a toddler who is a little shy. Usually the sound of running water helps to relax your toddler but this should work too. Its educational, and pretty sturdy, ours has been thrown around and banged against the tile floors and no cracks."
2,Fantastic! Who'd a Thunk it?,"This review will be short as my hands have a hard enough time typing these days. I picked up this book a long while back with the idea of seeing what all the fuss was about. A story about a bunch of rabits? How can it be THAT good? After reading it, I absolutely loved it and subsequently went on to read ""More Tales from Watership Down"". I can't tell you how upset I am that the story ends there. But anyway, it's an incredible story that has me wondering if the author somehow had an ""in"" with this bunch of rabits and how could he possibly know all of this for it certainly seemed ""real"" and plausible in the telling. The fact that kids now read this in English Lit (it was new when I was in school) is great because that stuff can often be somewhat dull and hard to read. THIS however is NOT one of those. I will love this book forever and will probably be reading it again sometime soon."
1,Tripe and Punishment,"This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read, from the painstaking reproduction of turgid Victorian poetry to the unbelievably bad and predictable Scooby-Doo ending (A-ha! I knew it was the Professor under the mask all along!) Hundreds of pages of writing, and yet the characters remain caricatures throughout (what do they like? do they have interesting opinions about anything? what do they do when they aren't squabbling with each other?) I cannot recall one compelling sentence in the entire book. It's like trying to chew dust."
1,Rough cooking surface,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008GKDJ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI've used this skillet everyday since receiving it hoping the cooking surface would improve. The rough cooking surface is still casting off iron colored 'muck' when I wash it. I know how to Season a cast iron skillet so this isn't the problem. I'm very unhappy with the pebble like cooking surface.
1,How stupid and predictable could one book be?,"I have never read such a stupid book. I admit at times I dapple in reading romance novels, but lets get real the lady screams I need a knight in shining armor and he falls out of the bushes. I am embarrassed to say I read this book, and you should be too!!!!"
2,one person's guide,"This book is, as the title says, one person's perspective. It has lots of useful suggestions for coping. It helped me by being an example of someone who suffered like i have. The part that disappointed me was that the author insisted that people trying to commit suicide dont really want to die. instead she says they are making gestures to call attention to themselves. Though this can be the case many times, other people are very private about their attempts and serious about dying. This technicality did not take away from the usefulness of her suggestions though."
1,"Sincere, but . . .","Sincere and highly personal, these songs lack artifice, but also are a bit lacking in art. In the tradition of the folky coffeehouse singer songwriter, Mr. King sings from the heart. His topics include personal relationships and homages to those lost too early to AIDS. His lyrics are often straightforward to the point of being simplistic and trite. Yet many of the melodies will stick in your head."
2,A book that will stay with you,"For about 3 months I had not read a book because I just did not have any motivation to read. I found this book, read the first page and knew that I would read this from finish to start unlike the other books that I bought and got sick of. I could not put down this book and it is very sad but the ending gave me a touching feeling. Some parts were quite disturbing. This book has made me aware of the kids on the street. I hope more people will read this so they too will be aware."
2,Work safety glasses- BLUE mirror,"These are good glasses. I have light blue eyes and here in Miami the sun is killer. The only thing is that the ""coating"" scratches and then you wind up with a line thru the lens. In being a union electrician, working outside @ the airport on the white rock during the summer these glasses are darker than any safety glasses I have tried before. All I would like to know is what is the actual number of the darkness. I tried welding/cutting glasses @ +6 dark but they are green and everything looks green and it blocks out the taillights of the car ahead of you (blocks all red light waves). So not that good to use as everyday sunglasses."
1,"worked great, then died","The region free worked great in Japan for region 1 and 2 dvds the first year. In a little over a year of infrequent use the door started to jam then the dvds began to freeze, have disc errors, skip or not play at all. So, now, I need a new one, but it wont be this one again."
1,An Actual Review,.... As a book of non-fiction I found the general theme for the story to be unbelievable. The idea that Christainity could have existed before Christ is a huge error in logic in the storyline. To believe that gold plates were hidden by God and then found by man and then NOT used to create a translation (rather a method of pschic translation was used) but then taken back by God anyway is absurd.As a work of fiction I found the story to be disjointed and poorly thought out. The imagry used to describe the various types of animals in existance in this fictional world was interesting as were the battle scenes. If this were to be reviewed as a fictional work it might be worth a 3 star. BUT AS A non-fiction work it is a 1 star only because this rating system doesn't allow any lower.
2,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Before I had seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" I had never seen any sort of martial arts movie and had only seen one film in a foreign lanugage with the original language spoken and subtitles. However, this film was so intreguing that I felt immediately absorbed.This film has an excellent plot line for an action movie. There is plenty of fight, but not too much. There is a coming of age element, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the story. Lastly the matter of love is disscussed and attended two in two diffrent veins, but does not overpowere any other part or element of the story. The ending was slightly disapointing, but the middle made up for it.Some people are bothered by the flying in the fight sceens. Yes, if you are a purist, then it is most likely going to bother you. However, the choreography of the fighting, again, is very powerful and allows the viewer to ignore the slight, fantastic moments of flying.Overal, great movie."
1,quite a boring read,this book starts out with some promise but seems to develop into a predictible and rather cumbersome plot I found the characters to be shallow and uninteresting but having said that I did find the authors style of writing to be enjoyable. A second rate secret history
1,Shoe Review,I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived. They appear used and have a small stain on them. As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again. Lesson learned.
2,Celebrity Cameo,"Could not care less about Sara Evans' music, but my best friend is the ""Looker, smooth talkin' son of a gun"" from Suds in the Bucket. This alone warrants a 5star review."
1,Of limited value,"If you've been to Barcelona, this book will help you reminisce. That's pretty much it.The story is quite bland. A ring of thieves attack the city, and the main character, an American lesbian freelance translator, gets caught in the middle of it. In pursuit of the bad guys, she goes up and down Barcelona and its beautiful monuments.The plot is thinnish and i HATED the ending (don't worry, i won't reveal it... but i found it very frustrating). This book is mediocre beach material.If you really want to learn more about Barcelona, pick up anything by Eduardo Mendoza. Now, that's good writing!"
2,Hmm . . .,". . . Looks like quality plummeted since my purchase. The cost today is $118.54 and I purchased mine back on 19 Jun 01 for $89.99 (plus some -$10.00 I had). As of 19 Jun 10 my chimes are fine. I have no idea if the tone is correct or not, however it sound deep to me. What I can say is that the quality of the set I received was better than what some describe in their reviews. That quality has held up very well. Nothing was 'coated' or 'painted' or '2nd hand quality'. Furthermore, my set has weathered some pretty strong winds and made it through fine. Seems like the company decided making money was more important than quality sometime after 19 Jun 01, which is a shame since the chimes I purchased are awesome. I'm sorry for those who received the poor quality version because at one point the quality was outstanding."
1,Zzzzzzzz,The action was GOOD when there was action. This movies was SLOW. Kinda like playing the game RISK. A whole alot TALKING smh I was disappointed :(
2,Superb in every way!,"This series was one of the best things I've ever seen on t.v. (of course, it couldn't have been shown on a regular network). The acting, the writing and the entire storyline were all extremely compelling. There wasn't one false note throughout the many seasons and I was particularly riveted by the actors portraying ""Stringer Bell"", ""Omar Little"" and ""Snoop Pearson""."
1,Warning - this dvd has stretched aspect ratio to widescreen,"This dvd has stretched the original aspect ratio of 1.33:1, towide screen proportions of 2:1. The result is a fun house mirroreffect in which everyone has short wide bodies stretched outof shape."
2,Absolutely superb,"Again, a most glorious read. Each time that I read this story, I begin to understand what it is really about. This is told in a very beautiful way and with deeper meaning. I would highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys a deeper story!!"
1,Disappointing,"Edith Layton is one of my favorite Regency authors, unfortunately this is not one of her better novels. The main characters were uninteresting and the plot was absurd. By the end of the book I simply could have cared less. I am giving this book two stars only because Layton is stylistically a very good writer. The story on its own merits 0 to 1 star. If you want to read some excellent Regencies by this author I highly recommend the Signet Regencies and Super Regencies published in the late 80's and early 90's. Her early novellas in the Signet anthologies are also excellent!!"
1,A valiant attempt,"This is a relatively simple tale, even if there are quite a few characters and storylines of different backgrounds ie. humans, mages etc.. However it pales into insignificance beside authors like George R.R. Martin. The author has a soaring imagination, and is to be congratulated on persisting over 8 years in order to get this novel published, but soon after commencing to read the book it becomes rather obvious why he suffered so long it getting the work published. The writing is somewhat juvenile in nature, the dialogue especially weak and often obtuse and meaningless in the context of the story. However, I assume this first novel was written when the author was quite young, so I grant that the more recent books in the series (with book 8 being now released) are of a much more mature and experienced nature, and are therefore most likely to be very enjoyable for those who have stayed the course, which will not be me, unfortunately. Great imagination, good ideas, shallow execution."
1,Anticlimactic,"This novel started off just fine. I was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.The characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. In his usual style, Dean Koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.However, the ending was so disappointing. I felt robbed of my time and energy. Maybe I have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.Definitely not one of Koontz's better novels. He does have many more satisfying works."
1,What?,"First of all let me just say that Erick Morillo is excellent 'live'. His legendary sets at Space and Crobar are beyond comparison. However, he really dissapoints with this ""played out"" mix. The track selection is so old and played out...it makes me wonder if he is truly connected with what is happening in the scene.If I hadn't heard him live then I would think that Morillo is washed up."
1,Delicious Tea But Be Careful!,"But if you have high blood pressure, skip it!! Even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels. The licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness."
2,Great product at a fabulous price,I ordered this early last week and they delivered it this morning. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together (no tools needed). It's sturdy and looks great. I looked at the Del Mar furniture at Smith and hawken and this looks just like it...only it's cheaper than JUST THE CUSHIONS at S&H. The cushions are very firm (almost a little too firm) but with a few throw pillows it was comfy. Highly recommend!
2,Awesome read - Amazing CD!!!!!,I was amazed by the power of this technology! Within minutes I knew something profound was happening to me...it felt like I was going to levitate at any minute. Very powerful stuff.
2,It's A Twisted Killing,"This movie is a fun Russian mafia heist movie. Lowly Charlie, a russian immigrant gets caught up in a diamond smuggling job only to have his friends flip on him and try to take the diamonds. Figuring out where the switch happens is fun and when Charlie fights back, he fights back hard!!! The twists and turns at the end are fun and worth the watch. Check this one out!!!Date Movie (Unrated Edition)"
2,Shake hands with Barry Crimmins,"Crimmins' satire can lacerate like razor wire. It's also laugh-out-loud funny. His comments on the current White House administration, and Conservatives of nearly any ilk, are biting and savagely witty. But even those who don't subscribe to the author's partisan ideology should be impressed by several thoughtful essays in this book - ruminations on his hometown near the Finger Lakes, a eulogy for a cancer-stricken friend, his fond memories as founder of the Boston comedy scene circa 1979, his introspective examination of how annual copious snowfall in Central New York state creates hearty skeptics, an encounter with a lost boy and a Good Samaritan. These essays and others show that the author is more than just a political animal. He's also a keen observer of the human condition (a hallmark trait of any fine satirist). Mainly, though, the book focuses on Crimmins' high-principled views, which are insightful, unapologetic, and often very funny."
1,Disappointed,"I was not at all happy with this ring when it arrived. It did not look at all like the picture, but flatter and rougher around the edges. Please note that the braiding does not go all the way around. This is clear in the picture, but I did not notice before I ordered it. Also, the sizing was a bit on the small side."
1,Defective,This worked very well for the first 2 weeks. Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers. I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars.
2,Great Book,"Great book. A lot of good information in there that helped define my feelings toward religion. I don't agree with everything he has to say, but what book does anyone? I especially like his extension in the later version that answered some of the critical arguments for the book. I felt that was a great way to end it. Overall, this book discusses exactly what the title says. It bashes the irrationality of religion well offering some ways to becoming more rational (these are some of the things I disagree with). The best testimony for how good this book is would be the level of attention it has received in the press and elsewhere. The fact that there are so many reviews for it is also a great indicator of what a good read it really is. One bit of advice though would be to go into the book with an open mind if you are a very religious person."
1,Huge waste of $$$$$$,"I wanted a safe alternative to the shock collar. this certainly was not it!!! I have an older Dachie mix rescue dog. He hates cats (which I own 2) I'm trying to break him of this habit of barking and going after them. The problem with the collar is that it sprays him with every little sound he makes. He makes some deep sounds (not barking or growling) more like ""talking"". so between those sounds and the barking, the collar continuously sprays him. He also figured out if he turns his head, he doesnt get sprayed. At least with a shock collar it differentiates between just sound and barking. the worst part....this collar can not be returned. So now I'm out over $35.00 for something that I cant even use.do not recommend this at all."
2,Hard to find great shoes; these are close,"I'm a guy with distressingly small, flipper-like feet. Throughout my adult life I've found maybe four or five pair of shoes that REALLY fit. These Dockers aren't a pair like that, but they're comfortable, with good cushioning, and every day I wear them they feel a little bit better. They're a good-looking shoe, if unspectacular, and are sturdily built; I can see wearing them for years to come and being just fine with that."
2,"Good, but seams wear after long term use","I've generally been very happy with this litter box. It's so much cleaner than other setups I've had in the past (you never have to touch the litter at all!) and obviously much less expensive than the robotic kinds.That said, I've owned it for eight or nine months, turning it over to empty it every day, and it has now started to release litter from one of the seams when I empty it. I think that after so many months, the seam between the top and the bottom of the box have been stressed and open a little when I turn it upside down. Not a major issue at this point (it's a small sprinkle of the cat litter), but disappointing given how happy I'd been with it so far."
2,Rope Pulley,"The pulley did not arrive as pictured -- handles are different. Regardless, it serves it's purpose and has been working out very well. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!"
2,An excellent book,"This book is exactly what it claims to be - a portrait. It does not claim to be comprehensive. Being from Malta I am very interested in the history of the mediterranean. I found that this book gave an excellent overview of all the major events that took place in this fascinating sea. This book (and all the books by Ernle Bradford for that matter) provides those that are intersted in the history, but not in being bogged down in details, with an enjoyable and (in my opinion) quite accurate picture of what took place. Furthermore, Ernle Bradford knew the mediterranean better than most library historians for he spent 30 years of his life sailing in this sea. He Paints a lively and entralling portrait of the mediterranean. Highly recommended."
1,Get a better phone,"My wife and I got two of these phones for ""free"" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration."
2,Well done,"Beautiful film, good acting, stays with the original story as well as a movie can. However, I most definitely recommend reading the book first, because there's so much that has to be cut to make the story fit into 2 hours, and no movie could come close to capturing Zora Neale Hurston's amazing use of language."
2,FrielingFrench Press,"I have gone through numerous glass French presses. This one is great! No glass to break, easy to operate and easy to clean. I particularly like the finished edge to the screen. No more catching the screen on everything. It is heavy and durable. The coffee stays hot for a couple of hours. All in all, I am well pleased with the purchase. It makes great loose tea too."
1,Fell apart after two months of very gentle use,"Bought these last year at Christmas time in a Gold box special for $70.00. Less than two months later one of the ear buds separated, rendering it useless. That's a lot of money to throw away. As to the sound it was OK, but not great. The bass on my Sennheiser CX-300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds is superior and they have held together very well. I would not recommend these and seeing another Monster Gold Box special today with poor customer reviews reminded me to speak out about the inferior workmanship of this product."
1,Blatant Attempt to Cash in on Reader Interest,"What a waste of money and time. Couldn't even finish it...flat characters, dumb plot. Written just for ""jolt value""."
1,How to you get help when the product you purchased dose't work,Got about 4/5 weeks ago for the first two it worked it was great for a single but then it just stopped working I cant find any help all I what is one that does work?Sunbeam I experted more from you!!Please be very careful I cant get any help so I think maybe a lot of people are having problems.
1,THESE SUCK,"EASY SET UP, WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. NOW WILL NOT WORK WITH REMOTE CONTROL MORE THAN 4' FROM TRANSCEIVER, EVEN WITH NEW BATT. IN REMOTE. TOO BAD, NICE SET UP IF THEY WORKED. WILL RETURN THIS SET.OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS FOR THOSE PAST RETURN/WARRANTY DATE."
1,Bad writing,"I know this review will probably be unpopular, but right from the beginning this play smacks of bad writing. There's just way too much expository and not enough action. The characters explain too much. It would have been much better to show us what happens rather than having a character explain how he/she got to where they're at."
2,At the Top of His Game,"Roberto Carlos is truly an amazing artist and singer. This is an MTV acoustic/live recording album in which Roberto sings 14 of his most memorable hits of his entire career. It is unquestionably his best work in a long time and one of his best CDs ever! The musicians are top notch, the crowd is enthusiastic, and Roberto's vocal performance is nothing short than stellar. This is a must have for those that are familiar with RC's career. There is no doubt that you'll love it."
2,Powerful lyrics accompanied by a powerful voice,"For those who have been tracking DeGraw's path to fame since the beginning, <i>Chariot</i> lives up to expectations. DeGraw's ability to tap into the listener's deepest emotions with songs such as ""Just Friends,"" and ""[nice to meet you] Anyway,"" is a talent that most song-writers are lacking nowadays. In all, ""refreshing,"" would be one word to describe this man's first album."
2,Best toy for the price,"I've had my Gigabeat for 2 weeks so far. It's heavier than the Ipod, but that makes it feel more solid to me. I'm not a big fan of the controls, but I may need to get used to them. The program isn't as awful as everyone makes it out to be. I wish Media 10 worked with 2.0 uSB, but that is no fault of Toshiba. The nice feature on the program is MusicID, if you have any songs in your library with any missing info, the program finds it and fills it in. There is also a great feature for downloading CD's directly to the player with the press of one button. Put the CD into your computer, press a button on your player's cradle, and in about 2 minutes the CD is on your player. Very Nice, great bang for your buck.By the way, order the Belkin Portable Music TuneCast II FM Transmitter. I play my Gigabeat through my truck's radio and cleaned out the clutter of all my CD's in my truck."
1,To many little pieces,"This product promises 300 pieces. Unfortunately, 200 of those are the tiny single size little logs. You can't build much with this toy. Rip off. I'd say pay the extra couple of bucks and buy a set that you can actually build things with, but unfortunately I can't find any others that don't have the same poor review. Hopefully you'll have better luck then me."
1,Missing Product ID Code... Could be Fake,The box appeared to have been resealed. The unique product code on the inside of the box has been removed. There is no way to verify that this is not a fake... DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON
2,Sugar Free but not calorie free,"This product uses Sorbitol and Asparthame to add sweetness, instead of typical sugar. The Nutritional Fact sheet on the back of the package said '35 Calories per 4 mints serving'. The packaging also said '40% fewer calories than regular Pep-O-Mint Hard Candy'. There are about 24 individually wrapped in a single bag. Personally, I think it leaves better after taste than other 'sugar-free' candies."
1,fuzzy sounds....,"this product is not good for major urban areas, where the 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, or 88.7 FM frequencies may be crowded.it also loses some audio quality and sometimes sounds fuzzy."
2,Honor of your company -review,For all Tom paxton fans most of his song lyrics are found here.I also found out some unknown info ( Trivia) on the man himself.Did you know that Paul Simon warmed up for him on one occasion.Harry Chapin also. The book is not really an autobiography and is mainly taken up with Song Lyrics and where the songs came from what inspired them etc. Tom tells very little about his travels and rarely mentions the various artists that were around the coffee houses of the 60's. This is not for someone who is looking for any indepth reading. It is short of detail. Worth having for the ardent fan but disappointing that it wasn't a biography.
2,Practical advice,He offers a real world perspective on the breeding of thoroughbreds. His advice on facilities maintenance is extremely useful as are his insights into the bloodstock markets.
2,I'm 24 with no kids....,I'm 24 with no kids and love this book! I have never laughed so hard! Whatley has drawn the most endearing pictures of a wombat known to man. French gives the wombat a great voice!! When I do have kids I bet it will be one of their favorites!
2,THIS IS THA PHATEST,"YO IF YOU LIVE A ACTUAL LIFE GET THIS ""CD"" ITS MORE LIKE A WAY OF LIFE THAN A FORM OF ENTRETAINMENT AND FOR ALL U KIDS WHO HATE KoRn DIE IN THE FLAMES U WERE BORN IN"
2,Good Music..........simply beautiful,"I have only heard about 15 seconds of each song from the sample but is already crazy about this album.Can you believe that!?!?!Believe me,I know a good song when a hear one.This is defintely going into my collection."
1,not worth the hype,"I was expecting a good coherant yarn in this book, but instead it was series of yawns. It appears that Mr. Gilder put together his Forbes articles did some minor editing and passed off the book to his publishers. It is all the hype about how huge fat pipes are coming gushing with bits. It does not provide any deep insights into the technologies nor what applications will exploit such fat pipes.A potential reader is well advised to pass on this, or at least wait until his local library gets a copy."
2,Sanity in a book,"I bought the No Cry Sleep solution for babies when I was pregnant, and it helped me immensely. Now my daughter is almost two, I thought I would get the No Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers.I found it's tips and techniques fabulous and so relevant for me and my daughter.I love how gentle and child-centred the book - and indeed, all of Elizabeth Pantley's books - are.While her sleep is not perfect, I have learnt through the book, there is no such thing. Having realistic expecations for her sleep is one of the many things I have taken away from the books.This book, and indeed, any of Elizabeth Pantley's books I would recommend for parents, either first timers, or for those with many children."
2,ProLabs Worm Protector.,"Absolutely love this product. Usually when I take my Rottweilers (2) to the vet, they usually charge a arm and leg for this stuff. I saw that I was better off buying it myself."
2,Santana doesn't get any bettter!,For those of you expecting Santana from the 60's or 70's ... forget it. This is the NEW & NOW Santana at his best! His musical talents never cease to grow & improve & this is a fine example of what he has evolved to.
1,"fotografy? Come on Kelsey, spell it right.","Kelsey's books can be helpful but his maps are pretty bad, hard to read, and why does he always spell the word photography, fotography? Why not fotografy? Why not just spell the word corrrectly? I would love to know the reasoning behind this, it would be good for a laugh or two around the campfire."
2,best earbud ever made,I really like this handsfree set. It is very comfortable in my ear with the different size gels and also you have the option to use right or left ear. The microphone is just next to your cheek. I can move around with it and will not fall off or rub against anything close to my face. The audio is great. I can also take it anywhere with me. Not just in the car! I highly recommend this earset.
2,Very good Lindsey!,"I know some objected to the beginning with what Rowena did to Warrick,but it was the times. All in all it's one of my favorite of her books. Lots of steamy love scenes. I recommend this read."
2,Christmas with the Kranks.,Anything Tim Allen is in is fun. This is fun movie and a welcome addition to my Christmas movie collection.
1,Waste of money,"I purchased these headphones for my hubby. We charged the unit up as directed. It worked once for several minutes and died. Determined rechargeable battery that came with unit was dead/defective. Replaced with dry batteries as per the instructions. Unit worked a few times, but always taking several minutes for the sound to kick-in after the headphones were placed on the head (very annoying). It would be a better design if it had a dedicated on/off switch instead of using the extension of the inner headband to turn unit on/off. Finally stopped working altogether. Unplugged the damn thing and threw it in the closet. Note* If you buy one that works, you must remember to turn up the TV volume EXTREMELY loud once the headphones are plugged in, and remember to return it to normal volume before you unplug the unit!"
2,Fantastic lock,"For a few months, I would lock my bike up in an open parking space using this lock, and after a period of no incidence, I became complacent and lazy and started locking only the front wheel and frame to the post. Imagine how stupid I felt when one day I came back from work to find all but those parts stolen. So speaking from experience: this lock works.The lock is big enough to lock two wheels together to a post, or one wheel and the frame to a post if you angle it correctly. It's hefty, but not prohibitively so; I carry it on my commutes in my bag without really noticing the extra weight (I don't trust the mounting bracket after reading the other reviews).As others have noted, the key sometimes requires a little jiggling to get it to work properly, but otherwise I've had no problem with it. All in all, this is a worthwhile purchase."
1,total rehash!,"be warned! the anthology cd is mostly just a compilation album taken from the previous 5 wwe albums. the wwe could have made this cd special, instead we get mostly all theme's that have been released prior to the cd. there are SO many older theme's not present, such as the brutus "" the barber"" beefcake's and what about booker t's wwe entrance theme??? no wcw theme's are present. this album is not worth the time or effort. hopefully the wwe will release a true anthology cd with the rare theme's and wcw theme's. stay away from this one!"
2,Devon is great!,"My favorite songs on this album are ""Rain Song"" ""Montreal Waltz"" and ""Generic Love Song"". All of which I think show her vocal talents and songwriting ability. I can never get these songs out my head they're so good. I met Devon Sproule and she is a wonderful woman with a gorgeous voice.I adore this album."
1,Get out the safety goggles!,"I agree with the majority of the reviewers that this toy is much too dangerous. What a major disappointment! After taking 1/2 hour to assemble, my son played with it for about 5 minutes. When the cars repeatedly flew off and one almost hit the TV, we both decided we didn't want to risk losing an eye. Also, mine did not come with a safety net to put around it. To make matters worse, I purchased it on-line and now might have to pay shipping to return it."
1,Doesn't really smell like lavender,"I was hoping that becuase this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender. Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item. It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap. The smell isn't horrible & it lasts but it was what I had expected. I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil."
2,You have to read this book.,"I thought that this book was wonderful. You get so involved in the book that you begin to question your life, as the main character does. I think that this book is a must read. It is beautifully written and has a powerful plot."
1,"Rick - outstanding, cd music quality - crappy","I really love this selection of instrumental pieces by Rick Wakeman. His music is unique and, well, simply brilliant. I was thouroughly dissapointed with the quality of the music on the CD though. It was flat and sounded like some garage recording on cheap outdated equipment. My recomendation to others is try to find a remastered copy of this work (if it exists)."
1,"Way to go, Hasbro","I bought the game as a Christmas gift, but it didn't work. There was some kind of electronic problem with the display screen. It would display these weird characters instead of words. I exchanged the game for another one and it had the same problem. I returned the game and got my money back. What a piece of junk."
2,Good gift for the avid reader,"I got this for my wife for Mother's Day figuring it would be much easier for her to haul around instead of having to deal with multiple books. She has been very happy with it and the ability to browse/purchase books. Slightly disappointing that the books aren't that much cheaper than paperbacks, but the ease of getting them helps with that disappointment.The font and graphics are very impressive and she has been pleased with that as well. If you have a reader in the house, this makes a great gift."
2,"Spiritual, forward-thinking hardcore","If you're a fan of militant, spiritual hardcore then you'll like this record. There is a heavy Islamic influence in the lyrics and message and a thick, driving tone in the music. There are only 3 songs for a total of five-and-a-half minutes of music so if you can find it cheaper somewhere else then you might want to think about that. La ilaha il'Allah!"
2,I only wish there were more...,"Shame on A&E; for canceling this excellent series! With the talent of Hutton, Chaylkin and the revolving set of strong character actors this was one of the best shows on television. Although the core characters (Wolfe, Goodwin, Fritz, Kramer, etc...) were consistently played by the same actors, the varying supporting characters were played by a revolving cast of actors. This meant that the client of one episode might be the villain in the next. Although some have complained that this was confusing, I think that it was an original idea that worked quite well. In fact, it reminded me of an acting troupe that would change roles for each stage play.IF you are a fan of the original Rex Stout novels, you will love these shows. The characters, dialogue, and general feel of the series is faithful to the original stories. Conversely, if you enjoy the show you will enjoy the books which are very similar."
1,Trash talk - Couldn't get past the first chapter,"I downloaded this thinking it would be something different from what I usually read. I'd like to know why some authors can't write a story without using the ""F"" word in every other sentence? I find it most offensive and it certainly adds nothing to the story. Can't say if the plot was good. Couldn't get past the first couple pages. Deleted it."
2,Works as intended,"I like the Topeak line of products. Well builtand good customer support. Works well as a fender,also. I leave it on my bike, even when I'm not usingthe pack."
2,Powerful Pop-Rock,"Since the 1970's the Italian musician Renato Zero has been making highly original pop and rock music with meaningful and intelligent lyrics. Zerolandia (1978) is one of his most satisfying albums. The melodic, hook-laden ""La favola mia"" (My Story) open the album on a high note, being one of those poprock powerballads that becomes addictive after the second listen. ""Io uguale io"" (I equals I) is equally catchy, while ""Triangolo"" is a fast number with lovely strings and soaring vocals. ""Sesso o esse"" impresses with its unusual synth effects, while ""Fermati"" is a gentle ballad. ""Amaro Madely"" starts like a radio playing an old song from the 1930's before developing into a dramatic ballad. ""Una guerra senza eroi"" (War without heroes) with its marching beat is another catchy song, and the sax-heavy ""Uomo, no"" concludes his varied and enjoyable album. Zero's great talent lies in his integration of the tension and urgency of rock with the melodicism of the Italian popular song."
2,Good product,"Great product. I love what it does for my shoes, and I love it. It is lightweight and works very well for me."
1,This won Grammy awards?!,"I was lured into downloading this album by hearing the song Don't Know Why on the radio. Honestly, after track two, I couldn't find any more songs that even compare to Don't Know Why! And yes, I listened to the whole album! Now, why did this win so many grammys?! Was it the pretty face on the cover? Was it the fact that she plays piano? This album reminds me of music played in the ocean liner ballroom during the opening scene of ""Ghostship""! Just watch that movie and you'll know what I'm talking about! I definitely agree with the reviews that say this is great for insomniacs!"
1,One of 2003's worst.,"Eliza Dushku is gorgeous, let's just get that out of the way because that is the only reason to see this movie.The plot of this movie is one we've seen time and time again. Teenagers make a ""wrong turn"" and end up lost or stranded in a dangerous place. But what's the scary thing about this movie? Well, imbread West Virginians of course. Seriously, couldn't we think up of a more frightening killer than imbread West Virginians? It's pretty cheesy. Even though the movie does have some tense moments and a few ""pop out and scare yous"", it still fails to earn your money.Rent it."
1,Poor customer service,"I just got a working H10 yesterday. I ordered one in August. My 1st H10 didn't sync to my computer and the firmware didn't help. My second H10 couldn't even get to that point. It would freeze after turning on. I tried to talk to customer service, but I would get a busy signal and so I tried through e-mail and it took 3 weeks to get a response that I would get a response. When I did get a rep on the phone, they only could tell me how to update my firmware, when obviously that wasn't my issue. I did save money by buying a remanufactured H10, but I don't recommend it. If I had bought a new one it would've been around the same price as an iPod, which is what I should have gotten in the first place."
2,wow the best series I have ever read,It has already been a month since I have read the second book in the series Fair is the Rose and I still can't not quit thinking about these books I cannot wait for the third to come out. I have read hundreds of books and up to this day I thought Sara Donita's series Into the Wilderness was the best but it doesn't even hold a candle to these.
2,Entertaining.....loved the scenery.,"Cute movie. I like Nia Vardalos, she's been entertaining in everything I've seen her in. Though she's not a dramatic actress it's obvious she likes what she does. I recommend the movie if you want something lighthearted and visually inspiring. After living in Greece I can completely relate to some of the issues experienced, it makes me miss it. The movie is predictable, ""gal is uninspired, gal meets guy she can't stand, their differences bring them together, OPA!"" I do intend to buy this once it's available, it's always nice to have a feel good movie around."
2,Wonderful quality for the price,"Impressed with the wooden construction. I disagree with others' reviews that stable is pricey - compared to Breyer and other sets I researched, for what you get here, this piece is well worth it. It is very large and roomy. My 9-year-old is really enjoying this great addition to her Schleich horses."
2,melissa & doug deluxe wooden magnetic kitchen bottles,I got these for my 2yr old. She loves them. They seem very durable and the magnets actually do keep the lids on. Highly recommend!
2,WE LIKE IT,"My husband and I have bought two of the DVD players and are very happy with them. There has been no noticable noise, fire, or refusal to let the CD go. The remote is not quite a &quot;joke&quot; but it's not the best. It's a cheap DVD player and we feel it's worth the price and more."
1,At Least I'm Honest,"First of all, I don't like to watch movies about dirty people. Dirty, (needs to take a bath kind of dirty), rotten teeth, do I want to go to the movies to see that? So this movie was supposed to be so funny, so clever, so original, so witty. I found it to be mostly repulsive. And for romantic? It was people lusting for each other like two high school kids with over-active hormones. There wasn't much ""romance"" in here for me.Just for the record, I enjoy the plays of William Shakespeare. I love to read his sonnets. But as for this movie, much ado about nothing."
1,TERRIBLE,"Do NOT buy this film.The ending of this film questions the very reason why you bothered to pay good money and sit through the movie in the first place. It leads you to question your own intelligence and purpose as a human being, for if this movie made 50 million dollars at the box office, everybody on this planet are certainly a bunch of wacknuts.Save your money, and your dignity, let this film sink into obscurity - let it rest in peace, not in your dvd player."
2,Compelling and intriguing,"L.C. Martin's tale of a young girl's struggle to find happiness kept me turning the pages all night. Her characters are heart-warming and their experiences gripping. She makes the reader care about them and with each turn of the page, has you hoping that things will be okay. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance, supense and real life issues."
1,Should've pay extra for Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel,"I got this ""his and her"" mugs thinking it should be as good as Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel. It's heavy and it doesn't hold much beverage. I should've just pay more and get the real deal -- Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel keeps the drink cooler even after a hot day in the car. keep body hydrated is good for health. Just don't put beverage that's too hot. rinse it and keep it dry every night to prevent mold. Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel is like a hidden jewel, wish we know about it sooner."
2,Vintage Bryson - Let the Reader Beware!,"Being an avid Bryson fan, I wanted to chime in with those warning readers to be careful with Bryson in public places -- reading the description of his jet-lagged snooze while being shown around Sydney by a publishers rep, I was convulsed with one of those omigod-I-can't-stop bellyachers that left me in almost as embarrassing a position as Bryson had been in. Listening to another book (I'm a Stranger Here Myself, I think) while driving from LA to SF, my son and I were laughing so hard that I missed the fork in the highway and wound up in Bakersfield, where I did not want to be.Sunburned is a great book -- very interesting and entertaining -- but should definitely come with a warning label!"
1,Not what I expected,"I can't rate this product with even one star! I received my product and some of the brackets were bent, broken, uneven and I felt as thought something that should've taken about 10 min. to put together took too long. I spent too much time trying to ensure that this piece was together correctly I finally got fed up, left it alone and then came back to it. How do you sell someone something that has pieces messed up and tell the person that it's brand new. I don't believe this was new as the instructions were missing from the box upon my long awaited receipt of the cage. I ordered on December 5 and didn't receive until December 23, why doesn't it take 2 weeks for something like this to arrive but it only takes 10 seconds to verify and retrieve the funds from a credit card? Don't buy it, it's not worth it! Go to a store and get one!Brand New Bird Cage Cages 18x14x46 With Stand 5894Blk/S"
2,A good read -- but where is the rest of it?,This is by far the best of Parker's non-Spenser novels. I enjoyed reading it tremendously. It is too bad Parker hasn't seen fit to follow it up with sequels. This book doesn't deserve the obscurity it has been forced to endure.
1,you will learn,"you all should have known but will soon learn that Nelly is Garbage and always will be. If you didn't know he whas garbage before he released these albums then you should have checked the CD out on ""The Leak"" on MTV.com and you would have realized it real fast. I'm sorry if you already wasted your money on this garbage but if you haven't hopefully I will save you $20. You all are welcome"
2,Informational,"This book really has practical information to get started your attic reno. It is not a pictorial design idea book. Its a good, ""cut to the chase"" sort of book."
2,Great stuff,"Is this the definitive Blade Runner soundtrack? Not from what I can tell. But who cares? This is great. It has most, albeit not all, of the music we loved from the movie, but that doesn't make it bad. So why only 4 stars? Because of the few songs it's missing. Having said that, this is good. It is Blade Runner. It is either Soundtrack, or music inspired by the universe that is Blade Runner. Could have been a tad better, but not worth a low review. Unless you're an anal meerkat that loves crying. Enjoy."
1,Errors.,"So many errors. I highly recommend the reading of this book, but not the Kindle version. Purchase his actual book."
2,Best Tires Ever,"I live in New Mexico where flats from thorns are legendary. These tires pick up less thorns than any others I've tried and resist puncture from the thorns they do pick up. It is true the newer tires are not as long wearing. In the past I got 10,000 miles from a set, now it's more like 6,000 miles. Still they are the best, longest lasting tires I've found in my 100,000 miles of pedaling."
2,Great sock substitute!,I've used these off and on for years and just found them on Amazon's website. These are used in place of socks. I really like them. You cut them to size. The instructions say to handwash but I've put mine in the washing machine and let them air dry. The terrycloth feels good and keeps your shoes from smelling. I highly recommend these.
2,Pretty Good,"Graphics are great, i'll give it that much. The steering is horrible. At every turn it's like crash into the wall. Too hard to earn money."
2,Best of the Vampire romance!,"I have read many so called vampire romances and this author is the best. The story is original, the sex scenes are satisfying, the plot is rich, and the reader is left fulfilled with the ending. I just hate that there is so much time to wait for the next book. This is one author that I REALLY look forward to the next book. I HIGHLY recommend this author. Thank you J.D Ward and keep on writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great Job Panasonic!,"This CD player is so great. Even the earbuds are good! It has a very light, sturdy, stylish design. The remote is easy to use and id3 tagging works fine with it. The buttons on the side light up and change colors when playing or charging. Like the review above I have had 2 Sony CD Walkmans (D-E350) in the last two years. UNCOMPARABLE! The panasonic is much better. It seems all of their products are wonderful!. I have a Panasonic cell phone, 2 home stereos, and an in dash CD player, all from Panasonic and they work great. The LCD remote has a backlit display that is bright so you can see it at night. Overall, this CD player is a funtional, stylish, light, and just WONDERFUL CD player. Highly recommended."
2,"Solves the Problem, BUT ....","Hooking this product up is a breeze, and I noticed only a slight degradation in sound quality. HOWEVER, the manual switch does not always reliably lock in place, and it sometimes requires some jiggling, tapping, and coaxing to do so. Unless the switch is solidly locked in position, there is no sound at all. Suggestion: Create/market an electronic (vs. mechanical) switch that detects the output device (TV,DVD player, etc.) that is turned on and then automatically channels the audio signal to that device. I happen to have an HDMI switch that I bought for the identical reason (insufficient number of inputs on my TV and home theater amplifier) that does just that; it even has a small remote control."
1,Book for beginners,"Despite being called as 'enterprise design and implementation', this is a book for beginners. Example (video store) is for amateurs, and all database is done on Access. Even author admits, that design is in fact two-tier. And you cannot find 'stored procedure' even in index - very interesting understanding of 'business objects':) I saw a bunch of people on interviews - immediately after person starts talking about projects like mentioned one, you may definitely suspect the applicant just finished some short course or read this book. As a book for beginners, it might be nice, but should have a little bit different title :)"
2,Very surprising....,I was mad when she married George! Alana should have married Prince Jon. I think that the second and first books are best.
2,Left waiting in the end...,"This book deserves five stars for a story well written, however I was left hanging in the end, what happened to Libby's father, who was the one who poisoned the water? The story deserved a ""finish"" like any story it had a beginning and a middle, the end is missing."
2,My son loves it!,"My 2 1/2 son recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!"
2,"Yes, Yes, Yes","OK, oK, ok ,ok. Now, I can't even begin to write how I feel about this album. It's the best (hands down) the best album Patti's has ever put out in her 40 plus career. I am glad that the true word of a ""Diva"" has been saved by the not so, lost it ""Diva's). She has proven that longivity is the key. And working hard at your dream can be done. Every song on this cd is my favorite. I listen to everyone like it is the bomb.The cd really took me by surprise, because her last 2 efforts were not Patti. This Is Patti. Every key, every chord and just the bomb key changes, I have ever heard come from her. The cd is definitely a Timeless Journey.Thank you Patti. For this. It has really put me in the postion to go forward with my journey as an artist.Love Kenp.s. Whitney, you could learn from this. I know you are going through the pain, but guess what? It is YOU who has to pull it together and make a come back like I know you will."
2,Old school.,"A predictably smooth and lush performance from HvK and Berlin, recorded at the twilight of the analog era.Baroque music played on modern instruments is grossly out of style now, but recordings such as this reveal just how lovely this type of music can sound, even if it's not ""authentic"". This is a beautiful performance of these concertos, done in the grand old manner that has almost slipped away with the advent of period performance.Karajan recorded the Brandenburgs in the mid-60's, and again in 1979 (this recording). The 2 recordings don't vary much in terms of performance style, but this set does show just how far analog recorded sound had come by the late 70's, and is an interesting look at another side of a conductor not really known for baroque recordings."
1,Wrong Book,I bought this book for my daughters HS class and I searched for the ISBN and Title and this book came up. Well when we got it today it was completely wrong book. The book they sent me was copyright 1995 with the ISBN: 0155002139. How do you get that wrong. I don't recommend this at all.
2,Supreme Album ( whos Method Man),"Well let me strat off by sayin he is Shaolins Finest. For 3 years he saved the Clan while Meth was playin with Redman. Now to get back on track its a greatest hits album with great ol school Wu classics and new age Ghost. You will enjoy this album with songs like Winter Warz, Cher Chez la Ghost, the great Buck 50, and classic All I Got Is You with Mary J.Yo aint got much to say but get this album cause its worth the money and will satisfy your rap cravings. On a last note 50 you a fool for contestin with the Kings of New York Ghostface Killah and Jigga Man Jay-Z."
2,Delightful!,"Nico and Dani is a fresh and delightful story of two teenage boys spending several weeks together. The director (Cesc Gay) showed remarkable skill at bringing realistic and understated performances from his young actors. The camera feels invisible as we experience intimacies between the boys and the two girls they hang out with. One of the extras the dvd offers is a look behind the scenes, amazing to consider such natural performances occurred with such a busy set. An interview with the director reveals the original work on stage was with an older cast. Casting younger actors really adds to the poignancy of the story.How different most European culture is regarding sex from the prevailing tone in the USA. Perhaps viewers will find solace knowing there are places people come of age without all the angst and homophobia of mainstream America."
2,"Worked for me many years ago, and still works today for younger ones!",I had a copy of this many years ago and loved it!Bought it for a very creative grandchild.Suffice to say not of all the recycle goes to the recycle (at least right away). :^)
1,Is This Really How the Navajos Did Things?,"I'm sorry folks, but I thought it was boring. I know I fell asleep in the beginning of the afternoon one day while I was reading it. Sure, the facts about the Navajo that the author researched, were researched very well. And I had a sense that the Author was going to let me in on just how much he researched, even if most of what he had to say was very subtle. I can take subtle from an author for just a short time, and then I go and look for a good Romance."
2,jack pot!!,"i didn't know how i would remove the scuff marks from the rim of my bathtub and the stains in my tub. i tried everything. so when someone from my job mentioned this product, i thought i'd give it a try. it works.....i am very pelased. will order this product again and again. thanks"
1,"How he got famous, I don't know","It constantly amazes me that this man is still considered to be a good comedian. If you hear anything off of this album that isn't stolen (almost verbatim) from Relentless or Dangerous by Bill Hicks, then it's not funny material. Please do yourself a favor and listen to someone else with something original to say.I think the fact that Leary has stooped to doing Quaker State commercials tells the whole story. This guy doesn't even believe his own schtick and is willing to do anything if you dangle a check in front of his face.Yeah, there's no cure for cancer. That's why Bill Hicks died. That's why Denis decided that it was OK to take a dead man's material and somehow turn it into worthless drivel."
1,Christian depravity at it's best,"I endured the painful waste of time to see this film the other night, It was an eye opener to see just how far Christianity has fallen into the ditch that it is in today. Then again the guy who plays God in ""I AM"" also plays in a film made in the same year called""Nude Nuns with big guns""I guess we all can lower our expectation of the Christian god, I know I have, as that god is not the God you will find in the Bible, not by a long shot. There are a few things I can't stand seeing, one is churches that put little reader board signs up that are signed by God. I have even seen them say ""open for business"" And they all cry foul when Cities try to remove the tax exempt status these Business's enjoy. The other is heretical brainwashing trash such as this. They need to have negative stars for movies like these. If you really wish to see how Christianity got this bad you need to see the film ""Constantine's Sword"" you can get it on Amazon."
2,Highly Underrated,"This is certainly not the best Doors album (that right is reserved for LA Woman). But it's still a good album. And it's usually overlooked. With staples such as Touch Me and Wild Child it shouldn't be. The tracks are all solid. Although I find Easy Ride and Runnin' Blue a little too upbeat, they're still solid tracks. My personal favorite on the album is Touch Me, their principle hit off of the album. Other standouts include Wild Child, Shaman's Blues, and the title track. All in all, a good but overlooked album in the Doors' catalog."
2,Some corrections to make.,"The above review by Sam Sutherland compares Rammstein more to a grim sort of band than it should be thought as. All of the songs this video holds are about love in one way or another, and Sutherland has a few mistranslations (Du hast=you have asked me, Heirate mich=marry me). Overall, the band is great."
2,great item,"I found this item at a local pet store. It was extremely easy to train my Labrador to stay within the containment, after about 3 months we don't have to worry about her having the collar on all the time when she is out, she just stays within the zone. a bit of hard work to install but definitely less work than installing a traditional fence. Worth every penny."
1,Wireless is off by default. Cannot be unlocked without connecting.,"My wired ethernet port died and I needed to get some critical work done. The wireless LAN is off by default and cannot be activated without first connecting to the router through the ethernet or using an indirect method of establishing a WPA key with a USB memory stick. Although I received a message saying the installation via the USB memory stick was successful, the router did not appear in my list of wireless networks, nor did it when I attempted to power cycle the router. Attempts to connect to the ethernet LAN port after purchasing a new PCMCIA were unsuccessful (I used a straight-thru cable). I then purchased a NetGear router and I was able to configure through the ethernet without any problems. Having set up 15 brands/models of wireless routers, this was by far the most frustrating and unpleasant experience I've had."
2,Best Guitar at even TWICE the Price!!!,"After going to various guitar/music stores and trying out many guitars (Yamaha,Ibanez, Fender and others) I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make/model and saw the MANY positive reviews it had. I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first, so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally (costing me $129). After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online. The many reviews were absolutely correct. THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great. I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought. Even though it is only an $89 guitar, I will treasure this one as if it was $300. Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave. Low action and stays in tune for days!"
1,a marketing ploy,"In short, do not buy this movie. We got it since it seemed similar to Tinkerbell, which our 4 year old loves (and we do too), and because of the Thumbelina name. But ever since purchasing this movie, my 4-year old daughter is walking around the house imitating the words and tone of the rich kid snobs in this movie. We are very careful in teaching our daughter to use nice words and to speak in a kind manner. I winced every time I heard the dialogue - including a few choice phrases by Thumbelina.It is a total rip-off of the Thumbelina name. This movie is already in the donation pile."
1,A total and utter sham and fabrication. (antiChristian),"This new age fraud's series of books are full of lies and fabrications, claiming to be the voice of God. This book claims that God suggests that value-less moral relativism (no good or evil)is the path to a ""new world order"" which denies the truth of love and Christianity and the absolute power of God. These books, vols. 1,2,3 are the most damaging attempt by an anti-Christian to undermine the truth of Jesus Christ. Don't believe a word of it. I'm writing a book called The Practical Guide to Real Christianity which will dispel the lies and fabrications of the shameful author of this pathetic attempt at deception."
1,It Stinks,"Awful book. Complete rubbish. It holds the readers attention like a monkey's first draft of MacBeth. To think someone out there really thought that the stringing together of these particular words in this particular order for over 100 pages was a worthwhile endeavor, is beyond my comprehension. The EPA is illequiped to safely dispose of this toxic slurry of literary effluvium. This novel should be labeled ""Eye Irritant, in case of contact flush eyes with Shakespeare"" The only nice thing I can say about this book is that the paper might come in handy if you are in the woods after a meal from KFC."
1,full slip,I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me. I will be looking for a larger size.
1,Not The Good Grunge I was Hopein' 4!!,"What is down?? First off I love grunge rock, its dark brooding power cords define my tortured life and I love playing it on a sunny day while I golf with friends at the country club. Anyhoo, a friend told me I shood check out Pearl Jam and said I should play their new one they just putt out with a dvd called ""10"". Wow, this was nothing like the good grunge bands, the singer is indescipherable, the guitarists play no good memorable rifts, and the drumber is just hitting old peanut butter cans, gross!! LOOK People, stick with TRU grunge bands, you know bands like Puddle Of Mudd, Nickleback, Theory Of A Deadman, 3 Days Grace, Default and Mudvayne. Go Bengals, 2009 Football Champs, Who-Dey!!"
2,The begining of all time greats.,"Alkaline trio have done evetything the right way so far, by proving there is hope for new punk bands who are not oriented by writing a whole album of love songs. Its true they have their share but boast a different approach to put it across. the new album in my opinion is great and met expectations, but does lack the rawness of previous albums, like the intensity of word use and meaning for example which maybe i'll catch fire posseses. But all in all good mourning brings something different and in years to come they will be regarded as greats."
2,Best Bedtime story ever!,"Great story! Love the pictures! My three year old absolutely adores this book, and requests it every night before bed."
2,A Must Read For Ice Age Purists!!!,Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
2,Marshmallow blaster was silly and fun for summer birthday party,"Ordered a couple to have around with other gadgets (water pistols, etc...) for use at a summer birthday party in our back yard. Once we got the regular size marshmallows it worked great, and the kids were able to get the marshmallows to shoot a decent distance. Would buy a pair again for the same use - silly fun and laughs."
1,Don't waste your time with this worthless product,"I don't have a tape player in my car so I bought the IROCK so that I could listen to my MP3 player. This is an absolutely horrible product and I can't stress how worthless this was for me. At first I put the blame on the fact that the only frequency settings you can use on the device were too close to stations in my city. OK, I can't use it in the city but I usually only want to use the MP3 player when I go on hiking trips or longer drives outside of the city anyway. It didn't matter. Even when I was unable to get any FM stations on my radio, the IROCK still fluctuated between sounding OK to having a lot of static over my music. Most of the time it was static. I wish I could recommend another product but I haven't tried another adapter yet. What I can tell you is to avoid this product unless you want to throw your money away on something that doesn't even work."
2,A highly entertaining read!,"I really enjoyed this story of two people who have to learn to trust again. Jake is a wonderful hero, and I have a confessed weakness for bodyguard stories. This one is right up there with the best! Don't miss it!"
1,wouldnt play,The DVD would NOT play in ANY DVD/BlueRay player. I even tried 2 PCs and still would not play even on a computer.....
1,back with the boys again?,"hmmm this was a let down. i really can't comprehend why ol fagin made an all the best album when there aren't any ""best"". if this cd was called all the gay, it might be ok. BUT NOT! Fagin is at his worst here and this cd will make you cry, if your lucky enough to not have your ears bleed. May this cd die."
1,Movie is NOTHING like the story!,"As an English teacher, I had hoped this movie would help my students envision ""The Masque of the Red Death."" Instead, the movie was hardly even related to the story. Most of the movie focuses on Prince Prospero's/Vincent Price's devil worship - something that is NEVER mentioned in Poe's original story. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING, NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,awesome!,great workout - I am sweating everytime and very sore - but thats good! I just need to be more consistant to see better results.
2,Good Deck - Good Value,I replaced my 20 year old single deck Onkyo tape deck with the Dual deck Onkyo TARW255. I didn't buy it for the dual decks. I bought it because I was pleased with the quality of my old Onkyo deck which eventually had a problem and parts are no longer available. Also the price was right. I've only had it for about a month and have not used it often. It appears to work well and has more features than I'll ever need. I find the controls a little confusing but then there is a learning curve for all new electronic devices. I'll climb the curve as I use it more often.
2,Great Razor,"I started using an Electric Razor at around the beginning of the year and Love it. No more ""Manual Razor Cuts"" and nicks. I know Norelco has a Good reputation and they have proven it to me by providing me with a comfortable close shave. I will diefinitly continue to re-order new blades as necessary. Thanks, a Satisfied Customer Chuck Gmurek"
2,Thank You,"This book should be required reading in every high school across the country.This book uses FACTS to offset the empty rhetoric spewed forth from the political figures of the left.Please America, try reading something like this before watching another docu-drama passed off as a documentary.Why only 4 stars? Because it was too short. I wanted the author to expose more hypocrites before I was finished."
1,what a cheap and tacky way to cash in on a tragedy!!!!!!!,"This is wrong on so many levels that I can't even begin to explain. This is in NO way a tribute to Aaliyah. I find this to be in very poor taste and demeaning to Aaliyah's work. She deserves much better than this. The people who sing her songs need to go back to their kennels immediatley if not soon. So, you want to know what my recommendation is, save your money or just buy Aaliyah's albums if you want to hear true talent."
1,A New Song,"Having read the 5th book in the Miford series first, I appreciated the character reviews that Jan Karon gave. I got so engrossed in those characters that I am now starting the read At Home In Mitford and intend to read all of the Mitford books. As I grew up in a Methodist parsonage, these books with Father Tim are very heart warming to me. I'm glad Karon gave those small character reviews for me."
1,Horrible,"While I did enjoy most of the Lethal Weapon movies, I don't consider myself a big fan. I picked this book up at the bargin bin section of my local bookstore and after forcing myself to finish it, I now belive it belonged in the trash or maybe recycled as a doorstop. Boring, tabloid type writing, with mutiple grammar and spelling mistakes. Also I'm left not really knowing much more of Mr. Gibson and the author seems to really love Kevin Costner, he's mentioned praised so many times in this book. This book is for a hardcore fan...maybe. I hope he someday writes his own book."
2,good product,"I have purchased this item few mounths ago,now I can say that it is a good tool for woodworking.The instruction are very clear so you can control the settingvery easy , the bit is good and sharpened.If you use this jig system on a hard wood , you can join only withthe screws , but on a soft wood it is better using a wood glue.I don't like the square bit of the screws .They are good screws but you have to use its screwdriver ,I would have preferred a cross bit.If you use this kit with a Kreg premium clamp you could work fasterand even better."
1,Poor quality.,This recording is of poor quality. Lots of surface noise. Instrumentation drowns out the voice(s).
1,Horrific crimes and abrupt ending!,"I've loved Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels for a few years. I was excited to pick up Blow Fly but had a tough time with all the abundance of horrific details of the crimes. The twists and turns the story was taking had me spellbound yet at times confused. But as I neared the last 5 pages of the book, I wondered how the book was going to end and tie up all the ends...and boy, was I on target and VERY unhappy with the ending! Benton knew the Dard family and associates and they didn't know who he was? And he happened to kill one twin in the wine cellar while the other twin gets away so easily? Give me a break...it all ended too quickly, too conveniently when there was so much wonderful promise...what a huge disappointment. And now after reading reviews of her next 2 books, Trace & Predator, I'm not sure I can stand more disappointment and gore through Scarpetta's eyes. I think I'll be looking for a new author who is more consistent...sorry Patricia!"
2,Works as Well as the Name Brands,The only real attraction of this item is its price. It is less explensive than the name brands but works just as well in my Seiko label printer. I am going to keep using them.
2,Reguarding the fly..,"And to think I was eating dinner when the fly was on the other night. I forgot how disgusting the scenes were. I don't remember the fly 2, but the fly isn't a bad movie, it's pretty old though and jeff goldblum has always been a great actor. I stomach alot even when eating food, i'm normally unfazed but this movie the fly can be quite nauseating lol. It was a little funny though when he was storing body parts in the medicine cabinet. I hadn't seen this horror flcik in years but i do wish i was not eating during the puss dripping, puking scenes and when his ear fell off and when he was all juicy and hair was growing in odd places and his nails falling off and puss squirtin' out. Oh yes good times, so what's for dessert?"
2,Must Have!,"I'm a mom with T1 diabetes and this book covers just about all of the concerns when one is a parent with diabetes. The great thing about the book is that its filled with tips and advice from other parents with diabetes.The book is a nice easy read too. Not too medical and Kathryn Gregorio Palmer's ""voice"" is like that of an old friend."
1,Normally a fan of Coupland,"But this one didn't stick. Microserfs? A-plus. Gen X? That book was rich with character and story telling. Miss Wyoming just doesn't quite do it for me. I actually didn't even notice when this book was written, but i assume after those, but it feels like one of those writers that....I don't want to say has run out of stories to tell, but isn't writing like he loves it anymore. Maybe I'm being harsh because I know he's a great author"
1,Not for the real health conscious,"This is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store. Nature Valley is a General Mills product. Very average, and you wouldn't expect much from it. The second ingredient (to whole grain oats) is high maltose corn syrup. Not an optimal ingredient, as we are learning. The other ingredients are eh, so so. They taste fine, a bit sweet, but edible. There are 3 grams of protein in each bar, 140 calories, and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces. That is about 4 bites worth for most adults, probably average for these kinds of ""grocery store"" bars. On the plus side, if you are need something that doesn't melt; chocolate coatings, etc. this would work for you."
2,"If you need the power, it will get you there.","The original batter pack died after 2 years. It could not even get off 0%. Of course, out of warranty. This OEM Battery pack, is a factory replacement. This got me able to keep track of the gang all day long and talk to them on the slopes.Hope I get better life out of this one for the price, that is why this don't get a 5 star. Just make sure you dispose of the old one properly. These things burt into flames and polute the landfills."
2,Talk to the Hands: Anthony's Days Shopping with Mom and Dan,"A very touching, loving story written by a father about his son. This book shows the love that parents have for their child in an honest, realistic manner. A functional family at last! There are a few minor mistakes in the editing of this book, but this is to be expected as it is a first book published without an editor. It is so refreshing to read a happy family story. I recommend this book for readers of all ages. I think that adults, as well as children, can learn much from the Brooks family!"
1,not worth it,This item is not worth the money. It looked great online but when it arrived it came with missing parts which made it very difficut to put together and 2 of the shelves were scratched. would not reccomend.
2,Nice re-recordings,"It's different from the originals - synthesizers instead of real horns, but I like it. Old School artists often do re-recordings because they don't necessarily get royalties from re-issues. Not sure if that's true for the Bar-Kays, but they should make money from this."
1,Barbados Island in the Sun,"This dvd needs to be confiscated by the Barbados Department of Tourism and will be shortly I suspect. It is the worst tourism promoting DVD and does nothing but damage to the potential tourist about to visit the Island!In fact, everyone we showed it to said ""Why would anyone want to go to that place after watching this dvd!!It was produced by some backwoods, poorly educated person who is a danger to himself and others with a video camera.We plan on sending our copy to the prime minister of Barbados to file suit against the person who produced this trash."
1,Resident Evil 2,"I hate it. The controls are very awkward and you cant use the mouse. The graphics are not that great either. It is not a third person shooter, The screen doesnt move and it is one background after another and different camera angles for each frame, once the charecter would be going in sides and straight ahead in another. It is very hard to move the central charecter, takes a ... of time time you get the correct angle to shoot the zombies following you, how does one play this game with such a bad playability. You would get very far. Bad Bad Bad I hate it."
2,The Moffatts ROCK,"I had never heard of the Moffatts before this album, so its not like I'm an old fan who has loved them forever. I'm more of a rock fan than pop, and the Moffatts are definitely a rock band. I don't care if they used to sing pop or country or whatever; the fact remains that Submodalities is a really great rock album that everyone should buy!"
2,"Completely stupid, Completely fun","Desert Punk is a ridiculous anime. That's what makes it great. There is not much of a point, other than making you laugh. There's no point explaining the story since the story doesn't matter. The animation, voice acting, dialogue, and comedy are all very well done. Despite being very low brow, this anime is entertaining, and a bit addicting. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. If you want to laugh a lot Desert Punk is for you."
1,Going Back to Turbo Tax,"How can a product claiming to have ""all the forms you need to file Schedule C- sole proprietor/home-base business"" NOT have the capability to create a form W-2 or W-3??!!!"
2,Good product!,I was very pleased with this product. It was a VERY good price compared to the same product from other vendors. It was described perfectly. I received exactly what I wanted!
1,No light in this Book for Flash,"The Book: Much more (and this is no joke) could be learned from the well designed demo tutorial which comes with the Flash 3.0 program. This book is just an expensive reiteration of what you get for free with the program.The CD: On a Macintosh level, there are only demo programs which you could download from Macromedia.com for free. Occasionally, the book would ask you to import a certain file that's to be used w/the tutorial and *NOT ONE* was present in the CD. - go figure!Overall: I believe that the authors should first read through the tutorials that Macromedia provides and then publish something that would actually be better."
1,Not so discreet faux piercing,"I wanted a fake piercing just to see if I would like the look of a real one without having to risk infections and stuff pertaining to having a hole in the flesh.It's cute but just not realistic due to the wire jutting out of the rose. Which sucks because that's what I was going for.However, I decided to get a real piercing, not because of the look of this product, but because of the look of a tiny metallic golden dot sticker that I took from my little cousin. Wish that I've done that sooner..."
2,"Riveting, and very emotional...a real gem!!!!","A rather complex bible story (there is nothing ""linear"" about the life and work of Moses) made simple, stunning and very emotional. This movie is a rhapsody of visual delights and beautiful music. It is a treat for all your senses!No doubt this will be a classic.Highly recommended.Cris"
1,garbage,The author should be ashamed of himself for writing such misleading information...especially to parents who are in such a vulnerable state. Please consult a real doctor before spending and funding this Author. BY buying this you are only opening more doors to this type of quackery.
2,Most comfortable slippers ever,"I've bought slippers for years. It's hard to find the kind I like: high ankle coverage, soft insides, tough rubber soles/heels so they can be used outside, and feel both secure on your feet and comfortable while you wear them. These meet all those criteria. Can't speak to the ""long lasting"" issue because they're too new, but they look pretty sturdy, so I'm hopeful. Can't speak either to the ""always available"" issue either because they're so new, but this is a popular brand so I'm hopeful there also. I've been frustrated in the past when a pair of slippers wears out by being unable to find suitable replacements. I hope I'll never have that problem again!"
2,Confidence,Everything you need to know including how to speak basic Chinese. I will go to China with a feeling of confidence.
1,Horrible static,"You get what you pay for. The low price sucks you in, but the static is unbearable. Avoid this phone set like the SARS."
2,Interesting Autobiography,"Jane Fonda was always my favorite actress and I was thrilled when I found out that she wrote her autobiography.Being a movie buff, I wish she would have written more about her movies and less about her political interests and actions, but at least I know now why she was called Hanoi Jane.Especially her difficult realtionship with her father is very fascinating to read and continues through most of the book.Why she fell for Ted Turner however is totally beyond my understanding. She seemed too cultivated, intelligent and mature to settle for that type of man. I hope she will find a more suitable partner in the long run, because there are some good men out there..."
1,"horrible movie, good book","The book is hundreds and hundreds of pages long. I don't know how they expected to do it justice in 2 hours. Changes were made in the film to be more titillating (though the book already has its' racy moments). For example, in the book most of the prostitues are Europeans and Australians from the lower classes and are not described as attractive. In the movie the prostitues are nubile Asians."
2,"cells yes, now to locate the curl iron!",finally able to locate the cells........now the curl iron. wonderful product!! BRAUN PLEASE make these irons for us die-hard's.service great.
2,Number One on the NYT Nonfiction List with a bullet!,"I suppose the only thing that confounds liberals even more is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" soon to be the biggest film blockbuster of all time is #2 on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction.Great book, great voice for many who will be heard this November when the Flim Flam Man, John F. Kerry goes down in ignonimous defeat. Keep up the great work Sean and keep doing your part to defeat the unholy trinity of terrorism, despotism, and liberalism."
1,Too abstract for a children's book,"It is much too abstract for a children's book. My 7-yr old was very disappointed and frustrated, despite my explanations of what the book was trying to describe. Thankfully, we only checked the book out from the library. If you're thinking of buying it, click the ""peek inside"" feature on Amazon to read a passage and make sure you will like it."
2,No more pressing problems!,"This is the best garlic press I've had. It has a roomy ""bowl"" that allows for a couple of large cloves at a time and the cleaner is a whiz! I wouldn't try using it without peeling the garlic as some have said you could, but I love it."
2,Take it for what it is and it's great!,"I've read all the reviews on this page, and people are taking this film far too seriously. Tsui Hark is a good writer people,a nd you don't know satire when u see it? He takes so many elements: Sci-Fi, wacky hong kong comedy, martial arts and john woo bulletfests, and overloads them with cheesy melodrama. Peter Mak takes all these elements and weaves a lightning quick stupid movie that you can't help but like. I've read many reviews that it has underlying tones about the Chinese takeover, but that's really reading into the film too much. Have a few drinks, and enjoy this film for what it is!"
1,Not layed out well,"Lots of words, but not to crazy about the pictures. Each page has one large picture or scene and the images are somewhat overlapping and hard to distinguish. Then down the side of the page, there are the dictionary words describing what is in the scene. Then, next to each word is a smaller isolated image of the item/person/action that is in the bigger scene picture. But the images are so small that it is hard at times to distinguish what they are. For example a picture of a knight, has the shape of a person, but it is hard to see the details of what makes the image a knight. This book is not really fun to look at and causes some confusion and each page is a bit overwhelming."
2,This is a gem of a book about Kauai!,"This cost me 1 cent (+ postage) for a great guide book on Kauai, Hawaii, USA. Although 2nd Hand it is almost as good as new and the delivery from the States to UK took 10 days. I'm really happy with Amazon's service - keep it up!"
1,Waste of money,It broke the day I got it. The plug got stuck in the wall and nearly ruined the outlet. The worst thing is that I can't get my money back because it would cost more to pay the return shipping than the product cost itself. The cheap price you pay isn't worth it.
2,Wilde Man Blues,"Woody Allen's blues are clear in this film. I think it's called depression is some parts. The jazz is good like a memory of jazz from a time we imagine. There is a scene when lights go out. I think it is in Venice. After some time, a single light keeps the show going. I liked that and will never forget it. Woody loves his own innocence. He is uncomplicated in this film. But you see that he is attracted to complexity. His mother was great in the film, a real natural. But I can see why he left her house and wanted the Dream. Here's looking at you kid! Thanks for romanticising the New Yorker lost in Europe so well. Henry James would be proud!"
1,Why the perfumy odor?,"These spoons have a nasty perfumy odor. I have to wonder what smell are they trying to hide with that perfume? For myself, I will return these rather than take a chance."
1,Incomplete info,"The size of the product was not displayed on your page. While searching for this product on Google the size was shown as 22"" long ans I was sent to your site to purchase. I placed the order and received the product today. Opened the box and to my surprise it was only 19"" long instead of 22""."
2,Entertaining Mystery,"Enjoyed Nelson DeMille's sense of humor while still giving us a good, can't-wait -to-get-back-to, story. Would make a good movie."
1,Complete Trash. Stay away from Westinghouse.,This TV was turned on for less than an hour less than 10 times in the last year and a half. It will no longer turn on when the power button is pushed. Stay away from Westinghouse. Waste of several hundred dollars.
2,Mighty tasty! Great straight-ahead stuff!,"If you love blues piano and want to hear Chicago-style played well, with finesse, check this out. Nice interpretations, with a unique and gentlemanly spin. If you've listened to ""Monsters from the Deep"" by Ned Sublette and Lawrence Weiner, you've caught some of Junior's chops. On the final track of the CD, you get to hear genuinely interesting historical data: who Junior is, who he's worked with, how he thinks. He says ""I'll listen to everybody"". Now that's good advice."
2,Review of Gizmo Electric Can Opener,"So far, so Good. I like the cordless ability and it has opened every type of can I've put it on easily enough. Works great!! I would recommend it to anyone. We'll see how long it lasts!!"
1,No Mint States,"This book gives photograde illustrations only to grade AU50, and the pictures are not very clear for comparison."
2,Great Information,"This book is a must read for women and men alike. Very well written, easy to understand, and a ton of information. Also, the rules apply to people of all economic backgrounds. Very useful!"
1,Bad Movie!,"This movie was not very good! the book was so much better, don't waste your time or money on this crap! The movie was not very good adaptation of the book! if you must see it, rent it, don't buy it!"
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,"Extremely P'd Off!!! I ordered these on Friday Feb. 10th. and got suckered into subscribing to Amazon Prime with the expectation of having 2 Day delivery.(I wanted these by Feb. 14th)So my Fiance was waiting by the door like a puppy for a week! Finally got these Sh***y diamonds on Feb.17th.Now my expectations were not too high considering the price.But, I was hoping they would at least look like eachother.One was noticeably bigger and cloudy,with what appears to be black sand throughout.The other was smaller ,more yellow with a big piece of ""black sand"" toward the bottom.These do not shine at all! I wouldn""t let my dog wear these!Not even worth the box they came in!I'll be sending these back,cancelling my Prime account,and visiting Overstock a little more!Amazon you suck!"
1,DEFECTIVE!,"I just purchased this product at Bristol Farms. When I first tested it, the alarm went off two minutes before it was due to do so. Subsequently, I've tried two more times. These times the alarm never went off at all.The product description reads that the alarm is long and loud. The only time I ever heard it, when it went off prematurely, it was short and not very loud.This product is made in China. Perhaps we need to get back to making products here in the good old USA.Now, the one I bought may must be a fluke and not representative of this product as a whole. But I would suggest trying it out before purchasing it, or having some sort of return arrangements in mind. Just in case!!!"
1,Bad bad product.... Worthless,Didn't do what it was supposed to do and was just terrible. Not worth the cost of shipping even.
1,This one should have been left in the freezer!,"I like Linda Blair,I must admit that was my reason for picking it up,but I'm sorry I did.I'll give you a run through the good and badThe good is that Linda Blair is in it;thats it for the good!The bad is that Blair is only on screen for about 15 minutes!More of the bad;Cheap camera,bad lighting,cheap sets,cheap audio.Almost seems like it was made for T.V. (which isn't a bad thing if the movie is entertaining,which is not the case here!)The zombies are too few and far in between.Zombies are on screen for 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FX were extremely poor!Boring as hell!Bad acting!Unfunny!Waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,All the lcds do is show 1 to 4 bars depending on how charged the battery is. Kind of useless. There are no options for changing the charging amperage. One of the batteries that came with it was actually leaking around the top. I returned it for a refund. I can buy basically the same thing with and led charge indicator instead of the lcd for less than half the cost.
1,Don't buy if you can avoid it,"Worst math textbook ever. Poorly written, badly formatted, and terrible examples. This book hasn't been updated since 1994. If you can convince your prof to use another book for future students, do it."
2,Awesome!,"I bought this for my 3 month old and he absolutely loves it. I did move the mirror to the top of where the bars cross, and he loves to look and laugh at himself. Super durable, as my dog likes to lie next to the baby, and easy to clean. Highly recommend this product, lots for baby to play with and look at."
1,Worthless,"I bought this remote figuring that it would be the ultimate remote, but after messing with it for a whole day I put it back in the box and filed it away for another day. I went back on the web to look again for a better remote. I found the easiest remote to setup and use in the ""X10 remote"" It took less then 5 minutes to program, and it was up in running. The best part is that it only cost $41.00. All the programing codes are built in and it has a 2"" by 2"" color T.V. screen with all the T.V. Icons. so forget the other remotes and get this one. So DON'T BUY THIS REMOTE! ""BUY A X10 REMOTE INSTEAD"" You will be impressed."
1,decent for price,"I really like in ear head phones and have had many pairs but for some reason these just did not fit in my ears. Not that great of sound quality. Nothing special, you get what you paid for."
1,I do not think this filter works well.,I have this filter. When the water is used in a humidifier it leaves red slimy deposits. When the water is left in a Poland Spring bottle for a week it smells like dirt. So how can it be filtering the water well?
1,Useless as Latin grammar text.,This is a dumbed down introduction to Latin and makes too much of the relation of Latin to English. Not worth the purchase price.
2,"This book is a ""must"" for any web developers' library!","""Creating Your Own Web Graphics with Paint Shop Pro"" is an excellent addition to any graphics library. Andy Shafran and Dick Oliver work well together as they tell you which graphics to use on your web page, how to create them from scratch, how to work with existing graphics and more. If you have ever wanted to create or rework existing graphics but didn't know where to start, this book is for you. If you are already comfortable with manipulating graphics, get this to learn stuff you may not even know. The CD-ROM that is included gives you all the software you need to get started. It's a great addition to your library!"
2,The Fifth Child,"This book is one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read. It really made me think about my own family and also about other people's family values.Doris May Lessing was most diffinately put a moral into this story that over the course of the book is hard to figure out but in the end is very clear. I believe the book is really about society and how it turns away and tries to forget about the abnormal or strange.I loved the way Doris May Lessing wrote this book. It is written in a very straight forward way. If this book has any flaws, it is the lack of character development.I would recomend this book but I'm not sure to who."
2,A World Of Differnts Meanings,"I often disagree with some things a writer chooses to share but those are small things that prove your thinking about what you've read and not just scanned the material. The one that stands out the most after 20 years is the piece on Cuba. Each piece however took me somewhere beyond my own thoughts. It is more than well written, it is thought provoking and at times peaceful."
1,disgust,"I was intrigued with the title, but understood nothing of the lyrics. As most of rap (hip hop) this is incredible garbage. only my opinion of course."
2,Great product-love it!,"Ok, well I have owned two second generation shuffles in my life. They are great! They are esspecially great for people who don't care about video or photos and/or don't have a huge music library. It is shockingly easy to use without a screen, and is the most portable thing I own. Not only only that, but it is sleek, and beautifuly desinged. It is made of anodized aluminum if you don't already know. This is a highly durable and easy to use product.PROS:small and protablebuilt in clipsleek, nice lookingmost easiest mp3 player to use\CONS:aluminum is a soft metal, and gets scratched fairly easily. But don't let that discourage you! All electronics are easily scratched. If you protect your ipod with a case of some sort, there will for sur be no scratches on your shuffle. I have owned my present shuffle for a few months, but it hasn't gotten scratched at all because of a silicone case I put on it."
2,"Great toy, son loves it","My husband got this for our son for Christmas and it is still one of his favorite toys. He has learned to ""bite"" the pigs nose to turn it on. This toy being across the room has encouraged him to crawl more. He gets very excited about the toy and knows it by the sound.He has played with it in his highchair several times and loves to drop it to the floor and it's still going great as should any baby toy.It's one of the best toys we have bought in a while"
1,Not compatible with arch support inserts,"These are really nice, soft comfy slippers, however,if you use arch supports, they may not work for you.I placed my arch supports in the slippers and thisraised my foot just enough that the heel keptcoming out of the slipper. I had to return them.I had no problems with the return. If not for that,I would have given them 5 stars."
1,Not good,It went bad and smelled like it was on fire. Sent it back I sent it to my sister and this happened to her.It really scared her.
1,HOW COULD THEY?!?!? IT'S RUINED!!!!,"How in the world could they have redone the English dubbing of this film. If it's being celebrated more than 20 years later one would think that it was because of the screenplay and acting voice acting talent of the ORIGINAL voice actors. BOUT NOOOO!!!! Manga had to mess everything up by not only using different voice actors but CHANGING THE ENTIRE SCRIPT?!?! It's a classic for a reason people, don't mess with the classics because you jus mess it up for everyone else. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
2,"Beverly Hills Cop Collection (Beverly Hills Cop / Beverly Hills Cop II, Beverly Hills Cop III) DVDs","THE classic Eddie Murphy movies. I know - number 2 wasn't as good as number 1, and number 3 was pretty silly in a lot of ways, but all showcase the humor of Eddie Murphy. If you only want the best one, then buy a single disc with the original movie only.These discs have a good picture and good sound, especially important for the fabulous music."
2,buy this book!,As a graduate from Bible college I can assure you that this lexicon is excellent for those with no knowledge of the greek. It is easily laid out and is well worth the price
1,Has Godzilla finally met his match?,"Summary: It's Godzilla meets Godzilla when the King of the Monsters does battle with a robot clone of himself.Despite the above average monster effects, script, acting and score, there's something about this movie that just keeps it from being a Godzilla classic. Two and a half stars would be a more appropriate rating. Certainly worth viewing.Next is ""Terror of Mechagodzilla""."
1,Problem child,"I have another Sennheiser corded stereo headset. Great headset HD450II. This headset will not stay on my head unless I am froze in my seat. I know Sennheiser can do better than this headset. Great sound easy to use, great way to charge the headset, just that the headset is not what I thought it would be. I have considered returning for a refund! So far I have not done so!"
1,Good night light but comes stays on all the time,"We ordered these for my son's nursery hoping it would come on at night & go off during the day, but it ends up just staying on all the time. It is also not very bright, just enough that I can see where I am going, but not enough that I can nurse him by that light alone."
1,Not what expected,These pads do protect your knees WHEN they stay in place. Regardless of how tight I make them they slip down and then I must move them back to where they belong.
2,Love the sound samples,Certainly somewhat pricey but well worth it if you need the added sounds. Now I have an entire choir and MORE added into Garage Band
2,Great product but SLOW shipping,I love these coffee mugs. In fact I ordered a set of six more but from someone else because this merchant is way too slow in mailing this out. Will not order from them again.
1,stay away,"i have purchased 4 or 5 recordings all blu ray from this manufacturer (they go by two names that i am aware of ) all had terrable audio, most did not play at all, most were returned .. this is the only review i have ever written guess i should write a review of the many very fine recordings i have purchased probably more than 75 are blu ray format"
1,Really Unremarkable,"This installment of the series borders on unnecessary. While Mat and Rand have plot lines that are actually resolved in the end, despite hundreds of pages with no development, Perrin's quest to get Faile back continues to go unfulfilled.I loved the atmosphere of the novel. It's a shame that such a striking change in the aesthetics wasn't accompanied by a big change in the story itself. We have gone through eight books of the Wheel of Time series with no winter. Finally the natural order has been restored and we have snow-covered lands and a world of white. This changes the dynamic of the world we've come to know in interesting ways. It's not until end of the book we have great sweeping changes in the story to accompany the snow."
1,not recomended,"This book reminds me nothing of Terry Goodkinds earlier work. I was very dissappointed by every aspect of the book and only finished reading it out of disbelief that it could be so bad. I am a big fan of the sword of truth series, but the book bears no resemblance. Although it seems the novel is supposed to part of the series, I still dont know if it is even the same story. I almost feel bad writing this review because I liked his other books so much, but dont read this book! it will seriously disapoint you"
2,It's hardly even possible for me to express how much I adore this book!!!,"Now, I won't go into detail, but I will say this: This. Is. The. Best. Book. Ever. Written. It's totally original, but mostly funny. Yeah, the humor is definitely there, with tons of cultural refrences. You do have to be smart enough to understand the jokes, though (like the Ford Prefect joke, which most Americans don't get). Well anyway, there's my rant. Hope it inspired you to read this, or at least think about it."
2,Traffic,"cannot be more satisified; it has saved me from a number of accidents, smokey bears. cash cars; spent a number of years driving over the road for the U.S.M.C."
1,Al Gore and his tree lovers are full of sh**,"There's no manmade global warming. At least give yourself a try an listen to another DVD that gives you the other side of the story: The Great Global Warming Swindle"" a Martin Durkin's documentary."
2,Beautifull!!!,"It's a beautiful book, very beautiful works from Sanna Annukka,the illustrations reflects perfectly what the lyrics of the songs conveys.A great piece for collection."
1,Didn't Identify With Characters,I need someone in a show that I care what happens to them. Didn't like any of the principal characters. Wouldn't have really cared if everyone got chopped up.
1,Plextor vs. ASUS,"Bought this unit for Christmas. Had it installed by computer tech. Software splash page would appear but clicking on links crashed machine. Reinstalled, uninstalled and reinstalled no luck. Computer tech installed it on his personal machine same result. Both machines have latest motherboards and exceeded the minimum hardware requirements. Contacted tech support and have been passing emails for over a month now with no help from Plextor. Went and bought ASUS burner for half price and installed perfectly and runs great."
1,Life of Pi,I love this story and had read it before but given it away. This edition has a terrible ugly thick font and was done on the cheap and is not a pleasure to read as a result.
2,A very important opera.,"This work is unknown in the west, but the influence this work had on such composors as Mussorgskiy is enourmous. The cast is very good, especialy Nikolay Vassilyev and Tatyana Yerastova. Chistiakov is one of the best conductors I ever heard. The sound is very good. In small roles the recording features some of the best character singers in the Bolshoi - Alexandr Arkhipov, Piotr Glubokiy, Boris Bezhko and Nikolay Nizenko."
2,Please remind me why I did not watch this sooner?,Awesome movie. In my top 15 for sure! I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. Tim Burton always makes me smile. Fun for everyone
2,Not great but worth,"I ordered this to get a special discount by meeting the minimum order. However, this was useful but not a great product to resolve my flosser needs."
1,Tarantinwho?,"What is supposed to be so great about this guy? This is badly written and badly directed pap and not since Monty Python have we seen blood spurting so generously. Is this supposed to be a farce or is it just sick self-indulgence?In scene one our 'heroine' appears bloodied and pregnant in a wedding dress and is shortly shot in the head. Things go downhill from there. The fight scenes are ludicrous, the dialogue appauling and every single step is utterly predictable in all respects except perhaps the level of bloodflow.This is just twisted and apparently pointless. So she's out for revenge? Why is it that I don't care? Oh that's right, the characterisation sucks.I'm so glad I wasn't the one who rented this."
1,Broke way too easy,"Bought this for my daughter and it broke within months. very poor quality. It looked great when we got it and she only wore it to church and family outings, not to play sports."
1,Horrible precalc book offers few examples,"This textbook is flat-out bad. It is supposed to serve as a transition between algebra to calculus, but it fails badly due to its inadequate explanations. Many of the problems are redundant, too hard, or too easy. Each section of each chapter offers VERY few examples, and these examples rarely correspond with the types of problems presented as practice. It is littered with typos, errors, answer mistakes, and a general feel of unprofessional publishing. The formulas and important ""boxed concepts"" or equations are often written in an excessively complicated manner. Where it needs to be concise, it drones on excessively. Where it needs an in-depth explanation, it skips over the issue. I used this WHOLE book through junior year and found it very unhelpful. Do not buy it."
1,A very boring game because it has no real goals as an RPG,"Software Quality:REALLY REALLY BAD. Patches that adds serious bugs into the game. New features that is actually a cover up for the bugs introduced. Terrible. Bugs include not being able to hit monster from time to time, cannot even log on your character for days, items disappear for no reason, and 1000000000 other serious bugs. People are already level 200 before the offical story line starts supposedly in september......Gameplay:If you don't mind playing an EXTREMELY buggy game. AO does have a really good character development system, lots of classes, lots of ways to develop each class.However, there is no ""content"" in AO. By that I mean there is nothing you can do WITH your level and equipment, besides gaining more level and equipment. So you gain a sense of doing stuff for nothing, which turns AO into a EXTREMELY boring game.And for PvP people, with so many bugs and so many new stupid ""features"" going in each patch, PvP is terrible."
1,Too small for my iron,"This is a great product if your iron fits in the casing! As it is, I am only using this product to hang my board."
2,Great service!,"Great, speedy service. The product was exactly as described. I would buy again from this seller!"
1,"Great Book, too bad mine wass missing 50 pages","This book certainly is not for everybody. It's simply vicious and provides a strange look into the life of a modern psycho. BUT, the main point i want to make is that mine was missing a solid 50 pages. it kind of had an effect on the product's usefulness..."
2,100% perfect.,"Both disc were delivered in good time and perfect condition, just what I was asking for. I recommend this product to anyone who like this type of music."
2,happy,"initially i was disappointed because the rings appeared larger online, however i am satisfied with my purchase. the necklace has a good weight to it and the chain is of pretty high quality- i tend to break stuff and wear this necklace every day! my clients compliment me on it all the time.ignore the other review for this product."
1,Do not buy this jacket from here!,"I got this jacket for Christmas. It's awesome and all, except the logo is stitched on the wrong side of the jacket and I noticed the multiple layers of white backing used to stitch the logo patch in was still in there and very difficult to get out. I would recommend spending the extra $5-10 buying this same thing from the real website instead of buying it here. Really embarrassing to go around and wear a noticeable fake."
1,Very disappointing.,"I am going to be honest about this book. I couldn't get past page 29. Oh, I tried, believe me, but it is just so laborious and contrived. I suggest that the reader look carefully at all reviews before opening this book."
1,cheated,"The five star reviews must have been written by friends of the authors. It's the only possible explanation. Full of spelling and grammatical errors, it reads like a mediocre high school short story that never ends. The writing is clumsy and heavy handed, the characterization is preposterous. It is, however, useful for other writers as a compendium of what not to do. I normally refrain from such criticism, but I bought this book on the strength of the reviews, most of which, in hindsight, sound suspiciously like back page blurbs drafted up by the 'authors' themselves. If you've ever had unkind thoughts toward the major book selling chains for not being more supportive of self published novels, this book will give you some insight into why they may hesitate."
2,Extremely Intelligent and Thought Provoking,"Despite the title, this book is not an atheist manifesto, nor is it largely about sex. The author, a professor of philosophy at Oxford University, does devote a chapter to sex, and touches on religion throughout the book, but really, more than anything, it is a book about thinking and ideas. Grayling is a gifted essayist, and each chapter is actually an essay - most only two or three pages long - covering such topics as marriage, guns, utopia, suicide, nature, and dozens more. Although he makes clear to the reader where he stands, each chapter is a nugget of wisdom and delectable food for thought.This is my first foray into philosophy and I loved it. Very stimulating and thought-provoking; I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in opening their mind, or those who value open-mindedness, insightfulness, and introspection."
1,What an outrageous group.,"What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent, and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, ""it's just bread and circus to the poors"". Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because you mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music."
2,Good Music....Just DON'T Listen to the Lyrics,"The music is beautiful, scratchy, spacy, wet. The lyrics are horrible. Bush is not William S. Burroughs, as much as they want to be. If you can neglect the words and hear the birds, you be swingin'."
1,Been Two Months,"I wish I could give the video 5 stars, but unfortunately I can't. The reason being is that I didn't even receive the mercandise. I have tried to contact the seller, but that didn't work. They can't even provide me with the tracking number! I believe that it is something wrong with that picture. I have even requested a refund, but they still stick to their story of it being sent. I am very upset and if you do not wish to waste your time and money, I suggest you look elsewhere for a good video."
2,dawns early light,A gripping story of a B-52 bomber crew dealing with the start of ww3 and there personal feelings of loyalty and reason.
2,The best of the series,"This book is the best of the hard to find Trixie Belden series. Trixie and Honey find a diamond in the Wheeler's gatehouse. Convinced the thief is still around, Trixie tries to find him. Though a bit slow, the characters are so well defined and have such a good time I've read this one more than any others. In this book , we first meet Brian and Mart and they form the BWG's. If you can get a copy of this one, it's well worth it."
2,GRAND TORINO,GAVE THE MOVIE GRAN TORINO A 5 STAR RATING. GREAT MOVIE. CLINT EASTWOOD DONE IT AGAIN. WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND
2,"4 stars, you all just give anybody 5 stars","The Roots are dope everybody knows that. This album is real good in comparision to 90% of hip hop albums but I also think the previous 2 were better. I bought this, Eminem, DJ Quik and Prince Paul the same day. I think this is the second best out of the bunch behind Eminem. That is a hip hop classic. This is close though and mosdef worth your 15 bones or whatever."
2,Positively Hilarious,"BEFORE I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW I READ THROUGH EVERYSINGLE ONE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN POSTED. TO ALL THOSE WITH NEGATIVE COMMENTS, YOU MUST BE REPUBLICAN AND/OR BRAINDEAD. THIS BOOK SAVED MY LAST MONTH OF SCHOOL. BUT I MUST WARN YOU, DO NOT READ THIS IN A PUBLIC PLACE. I LAUGHED NON-STOP, IN FACT I EVEN HAD THIS BOOK TAKEN AWAY FROM ME IN CLASS TWICE FOR INTERRUPTING WITH MY ""ABNOXIOUS LAUGHTER."" THOUGH MS. HANDLER DOES NOT END EVERY NIGHT WITH A HOMERUN, SHE MAKES UP FOR IT WITH HILARIOUS STORIES AND TALES OF HER RACIST FATHER AND SEMI-RETARDED ROOMATE. THIS BOOK IS GENIUS FROM BEGINING TO END. PUT DOWN THAT HARRY POTTER BOOK AND PICK THIS ONE UP!"
2,"Beautiful, great collection","Great retouch of the original comics, a few little extras and sketches here and there, foreward and notes by others. Great, great series and amazing book. Comes with box for the book which is also gorgeous and does not fall apart."
1,WHO KNOWS,"...I couldn't watch any more of this ridiculous shlocker after the first ten minutes. The acting goes beyond awful.....so if it's good, I'll never know!!!"
1,"not ""cables to go"" brand name. Buyer beware!","these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff. although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long. As the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" but this is nothing less than false advertising."
2,Jorgenson Bench Clamp,"I've been using a set of these this week for a bookshelf project. They clamp the shelf sections to the workbench for use with the PC 557 biscuit joiner. They hold well, don't mar your work, and they're easy to install. The price is fair and they work as advertised."
2,IF YOU LIKE HARD STUFF YOULL LOVE THIS,THIS CD IS JUST AWESOME!!! THERE ONE OF THE HARDEST BANDS IVE HEARD IN A WHILE-IF YOU LIKE MUSIC SUCH AS SLIPKNOT OR ANY OF ROB ZOMBIES STUFF YOULL ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD!!!!
1,Lasted all of 2 days with my 5 yr old,"My 5 yr old loved the toy, problem is quality of the product is crappy. The ball bearing the beyblade spins on came out on the very first day playing in the kitchen area on tiles.The 'lock' is plastic and that broke on the second day. Overall, my 5 yr old played with it for about 2 days while it worked, and then improvised to play with it for maybe another 4-5 days as he was real excited to have it. Anyway for $20+ product I would have expected a better quality."
2,"Grayish color, not silver",Functions well. Just the color looks kind of greenish gray rather than silver as it is showed in the picture. Might ended up spray paint it white for better decor purpose. Overall very satisfied.
1,wrong book,The book details and the look inside relate to another book entirely-one about quilts for babies.
2,The Oddest Movie in Many Years,"I went to see this one with three of my friends and we all agreed that it was very unsettling to watch, but we all enjoyed it very much. It's just that kind of movie. Its certainly an original. And everyone agreed Adam Sandler's performance is the best thing about it -I would even say Oscar-caliber. I'm giving it five stars here simply for its uniqueness. (And I would suggest to the cheeches who thought it was ""the worst picture I ever saw"" to go spend thier time and bucks on pablum like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" or ""White Oleander"".)"
2,Nsync NO strings Attached,I was loving it . its a great cd i love almost all the songs on it its in my cd player right know im not lieing its a good cd I REALLY LIKE #10 IT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG THEY ALSO HAVE A SONG WITH LISA LOPEZ IN THEIR THE SONG WAS WRITEN BY JC HE IS SUCH A HOTTIE THEIR JUST GREAT ALL TOGETHER ALSO IF YOU LIKE NSYNC YOU WILL LOVE BILLY CRAWFORD SO CHECK OUT HIM ~mEEKIN~
1,all sounds the same,all the songs sound the same plus they are pretty evil of a band(just look at that album names) plus the songs just have fast beats and fast guitar and thats it... and it has some singer growling really instead of singing. dont buy this album
2,Fast service,"This was a christmas present that I was sure would not make it on time, much to my surprise, it arrived very quickly & was in top notch condidon. I look forward to doing more business with you."
1,"One good song, rest are duds","Dr. Lonnie, what's the problem? You give us one 'A' cut (Paper Tiger) and the balance of the album are all 'B' filler songs. Additionally, the B pieces all sound like they come from the 1970's. What a waste.Dr. Lonnie can move and grove you, but someone torpedoed this album and its overall rating is: A clunker to avoid.Go with Dr. Lonnies other albums which are winners."
2,Gluten Free,I was very excited to finally purchase this book. It is so helpful and easy to follow. Excited to make the recipes.
1,Give us the originals on DVD!,"If you want to see Star Wars, and you own the ORIGINALS on VHS, don't buy this. George Luca$ was once a good film-maker, and his movies began to stink because all he cares about now is BIG BUX! I'm not really a die-hard star wars fan, but George Lucas shouldn't have digitally altered your his films! Everything is CGI! I'm fine with PUPPETS and guys in costumes! George Lucas even admits rather have done an all-CGI CARTOON instead. I hope you are reading this, Luca$! Keep your VIDEOS if you have them... still."
2,The best of the middle-tier video cards,"Easy to install and very few campatability issues. If you don't want to spend close to five-hundred dollars to get the next best card this 6800gt is a solid performer. In fact if your motherboard can support it get 2 of these and the SLI results are the smoothest you can get.Nvidia uses the same drivers for almost all its cards and funcitionality is good without being overwhelmed. About the only time I would say buy an ATI version card instead would be for the consumer using multiple monitors and/or watching TV from the card. These are not Nvidia's strongest areas, since speed and throughput are what you are buying.For features and customization ATI's Catalyst COntrol Center far outshines any software Nvidia offers. Of course with the customizations comes conflicts if the user is not experienced at tweaking"
2,Worked ok but ended up removing it,"If you have ever masked something to be painted then you know how accurate you have to be when lining up the edges. The same thing applies with this stuff. Sure you can overlap and then exacto/razor it off but then you create waste. This stuff works pretty good but it doesnt like corners. The key is not to stretch the tape, if you do then it will pull off after a little bit. It stuck really well through a heavy rain storm right after application. I didnt like how I had to put multiple pieces on for a corner and seeing edges really bothered me. Going to try plastidip next time."
1,Frenchies : Forget about it !,One more Canadian dub.... Never buy that one for the french version. The same for the Zone 2 version !
2,Love this color,"Such a pretty, fun, bold color to wear out. Always get so many compliments when I'm out and about. Definitely recommend."
2,"Lights Up New Brain Circuits, Opens New Possibilities","""Better Than Perfect"" is better than best. It is stimulating, evocative, and engaging. This ingeniously simple book triggers different insights and outlooks toward our careers, our businesses, and our lives.This book shows you why and how to be one of the indispensible, irreplaceable few who make a business extraordinary. How to think, learn, and communicate differently. With real-world examples, blended into a business fable.I underlined, highlighted, and made notes in the margins of better than 43 pages of this elegantly-written book.I got dozens of jewels out of Dale Dauten's book. But it got even more out of me.""Better than Perfect"" may just be one book you can't stop thinking about.Michael Cloudauthor,""Secrets of Libertarian Persuasion"""
1,Do your self a favour buy behind the paint,This offers the commited Juggalo no real insight into ICP it is a mish mash of stuff and snippets gleaned from the definative book behind the paint by Violent J.Do yourself a favour dont get mugged read up on ICP on their website or another fansite and buy the proper book this is nothing new and definatley not fantastic but dull and pedestrian.
2,smear campaign.,"Due to the nature of the information contained in this book, as well as the fact that I have managed to upset some people, there is a campaign by a few individuals to post bad reviews in an effort to hinder sales. This book has been on the market now for well over a year and as of yet, it has not received a legitimate bad review. The book has actually helped many people. Thank you, W. T. Samsel (author)"
2,Good,"smallville is one of my favorite shows, so i can't say nothing negative about it.. at least of the top of my head lol. the product came onetime, if i remember correctly i think i did the one-day delivery.. so that was good."
2,amazingly different from any sound you've heard before,"I've loved this CD from the moment I bought it and played it for the first time driving in my car. There is just something compelling about Adam Levine's voice and it goes perfectly with the rock beats that are heard throughout this album.i'd say my favourite song would have to be Through With You, although each and every song is great -from the edgy Harder To Breathe, to the balladic She Will Be Loved."
1,Bad service / Bad support,Washington DC and Arlington VA 3G service is spotty at best. Do yourself a favor and stay with Sprint or Verizon. Cingular will also not work in the metro.
1,its small !,"we bought this for our air navigator so that our 4 yr old and 2 yr old could ride together, but the seat is so small! the seat even seems small for the 2 yr old compared to the air navigator seat. as pictured, this insert is the front seat for the person who has to pedal. so the stronger person gets a small seat. the only other issue i have is that my 4 yr old's knees hit the handlebars because you can't adjust the seat back very far (he's avg height to slightly above avg maybe). its a nice product but keep in mind the seat is really really small."
1,Erroneous Assertions,"Having read St. Augustine's City of God, John Calvin's Institutes, Martin Luther's The Bondage of the Will, and having just finished my tenth reading of the entire Bible, I am convinced that Hunt misses the meaning of God's love. This is a book not about God's love, but about man's gloriousness. It would fit well among the writings of the Age of Enlightenment, except for its bad scholarship. Particulars about the author's misinterpretation of the above books abound in reviews by other sensible readers, so I shall spare you... Readers who give this book more than one star fascinate me. My conclusion is that they have read neither the Bible (unless they have read it in their sleep) nor the works of the theological giants mentioned above. For that they are to be grievously pitied."
1,broke,"I bought this the end of November of 2004 for Christmas. It lasted 6 months and then I got the HO3 code, ""can't read disc"". I sent it back to Panasonic who wants $100 for replacement even though it's still under warranty because ""parts and labor"" warranty is only 90 days. I'll never buy another Panasonic product again. This unit is not inexpensive and to have it last less than 1 year is unacceptable."
1,Worst Album I've Ever Bought,"I've bought a lot of albums over the years, including every one of PFR's albums. This represents the worst album I've ever purchased. Since I am a PFR fan, and actually wanted to like this album, the album may even be worse than I think it is. Nevertheless, it is a shame that PFR would put out this album."
1,Don't buy it,This is not even close to black metal. It has no feeling of darkness to it. Varg might as well be a Christian.
1,"Good movie, bad format","For the content of the movie I give it four stars. However, this is a 4x3 cropped version. This appears to be the only format it is available in, so no blame to Amz."
2,Good Tent so far,"I bought this tent on amazon.com and it arrived right on time. The first time i opened the box it was missing one piece, but we were able to fabricate the wrong piece they gave us into the right one. Recently got back from a trip to Valentine Ne. Slept in the tent for 4 nights. It withstood 30 to 35 mph winds without any problem. Tent seems sturdy and holds fairly good heat."
2,Great,Very good for its price and it is the suitable case for protection and has lot of spaces for many things
2,What an inspiration!,"I am a librarian and read a galley of this book and couldn't put it down! I wish that it had lasted longer, because I finished it so quickly. This book is a reminder of what we already know as African-Americans, but often forget. Thanks to the author for reminding me that ""We are free not to do what we want, but what we are supposed to do"""
2,Threads,"Great sewing magazine frequently hard to locate on magazine racks in stores, if you sew well worth the price, you always learnsomething"
1,Place it back on the shelf!,"Fellman attempts a survey of sorts of Robert E. Lee's musings on a myriad of topics. As usual with political correct revisionism, Lee's OWN thoughts don't get in the way of Mr. Fellman's own bias and conjecture. Sure to be a big hit, however, with those of an anti-Southern slant."
2,"Art Therapy, Inner Child, Internalized Parent...","This book has Art Therapy exercises and dialog exercises with your inner child (who can be playful, vulnerable, angry, etc). For instance you might be instructed to ask your inner child a question by writing it with your dominant hand. Then you answer the question with your nondominant hand (e.g. for many of us our left hand that we don't usually write with). There are also exercises that involve your internalized Parent (nuruturing, protective, critical, etc.)The exercises seem to be a blend of Art Therapy, Transactional Analysis and Gestault Experiments. As such the exercises can be somewhat risky since they bring up intense feelings. I wouldn't use some of these except under a therapist's supervision.However, this book seem VERY useful for adding to the tools of a practicing therapist."
1,boooooooooring...,"Sometimes a great deal of time, money, and imagination is simply wasted, all good intentions notwithstanding.This is, without question, one of those times."
1,I love the pattern but NOTHINg else about these dishes,"I really want to like these dishes because the Napoli pattern is very attractive. It's the perfect look I wanted. We have had our set for about one year. Many of the pieces now have chips in them. These dishes get extremely HOT in the microwave before the food even gets heated enough. They will burn your fingers if you don't use an oven mitt to pick them up. The soup bowl is huge, I would like it to be smaller. The coffee cup is gigantic. I have read several other reviews that detailed similar disappointments. It sounds like all complaints to Pfaltzgraff are falling on dear ears, that is the worst fault of all!"
2,Excellent Emmet Fox in a condensed format.,"Emmet Fox's spiritual philosophy is offered up in a wonderful collection of short essays. Each reading has something new to offer for meditation and spiritual guidance and growth. I have enjoyed reading this as a morning meditation along with ""Around the Year with Emmet Fox""."
1,Bought and Returned It,"I had no problems with the instructions, but once put together, it didn't fit my bike. The box does claim it fits ""most"" bikes, but honestly, the brackets that attach to the rear frame are so close together it's a wonder it fits ANY bike. My wife and I had to pull the bracket apart to get it on the frame, thereby strectching it almost to the point of breaking it. I took it all apart and diuble-checked the installation. Same thing. Also - The bolt tops and nuts protrude from the brackets enough where it would be easy for a child to get scrapped or cut. Bolt heads should set in the brackets to create a flat surface. Going to look for something else."
1,"Sounds good, but won't last the long-haul...","It sounds good, but no use if it can't stay in the soundhole. I placed my pickup into a portable Yamaha F-1 acoustic.It fit snuggly - fine, great.However, after only about a handful of times taking the pickup out and putting it back into the soundhole, the PLASTIC ""stays""/notched pegs which swivel and brace the soundhole (that is, the plastic pieces which keep the pickup in the soundhole) would not stay taught/fixed.The result - the plastic stays would swivel too easily and collapse the pickup into the soundhole - bummer.I returned it, consequently."
2,great movie,"for all people who are for gun control should watch this movie,had the finnish not had the civilan guard the russians would have run right over them.to this day all people from the age of 18 to 52 must serve and keep weapons as i understand it.it's also a time in our history were we should hang our heads in shame because we stood by when they asked our help and we refused.a great movie for a courages country.my deepest respect to the finnish.i also recommend reading the book The Winter War"
1,Get what you pay for,"I used one of the lanterns, and the bulb died within about 2 hours. I'm now having a heck of a time finding a replacement bulb, which I now fear is deliberate: force the customer to buy a new lantern."
1,terrible,"HELLO LOSERSthis cd is a dud,does music get any worse than this NO,NOT AT ALL.IS THERE ANTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS CD,NO ABSOLUTELY NOT.please dont waste your money on this awful cd.there is better music out there.DONT BUY THIS CD.adios BOBBY BROWN."
1,one of my least favorite romances,"first time doing a review... feel like i really need to share so people don't waste their time/money. honestly, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies/dramas. however, the acting in this movie was so poor and the story-line was lame. i really couldn't relate to the characters and didn't find them at all believable. i wouldn't even watch this movie if it was shown on a transatlantic flight and i had nothing better to do. and that says a lot."
2,Reminiscent of Grandma,"I loved this book because it was more than just recipes, it had the story as well. The recipes were true and provided with the original ingredients, reminded me of my grandmothers cooking. I would have liked to see a section that described some of the ingredients we don't normally see in our markets in order to know where to look."
2,a Thrilling intro to Pink Martini,"I first saw/heard of PM on PBS, I'm sure many others are Same.(much as I 'hate' to say it) IF you haven't seen Pink Martini in person (me X 3) YOU HAVEN'T LIVED.THEY WILL ROCK YOU, they will lay you down in the aisles.they look good, they Sound FABULOUS, and they will leave you WANTING MORE.(anything else I could say would take away from the description)"
2,Why It's so big deal?,"Well i was Reading the reviews and I kind of surprise how terrible can be the antipathy could have some people with this band.Well I'm not a big fan, I really like the second and this album, I like how they sound, I like the energy that they proyect, The first album kind of good but not enough, But since West Borland is not anymore ..the things I guess is going down with this band, and no matter what Fred Durst can do....but I don't think that himself will put his band in the level of the second and the third album again.... or who knows..."
1,tank heater,"Add for heater does not say that it can not be adjusted for thermostat.The temperature settings are set to go on at 40Degrees, I needed a setting higher but could not adjust. Cannt be returned. Not worth buying."
2,I loved this show,Pinwheel was an incredible show!!!! It had very fun and entertaining skits using puppets(kind of like Sesame Street and the Muppets). In my opinion Pinwheel was much better than the both of them. I wish I could get a copy of all the seasons.Pinwheel pinwheel spin me around....look at my ..(can't remember the word)..... and see what I found....pinwheel:)
1,Soul-Sucking Waste of 2 Hours,"I regret giving this film one star. Amazon should make zero stars an option.This is a pretentious Russian ""art film"" in the Tarkovsky tradition. Not much of a plot. Mostly just images on a screen. I watched all of it only to see if anything makes sense at the end. It doesn't.If you enjoy watching silent, ten-minute scenes of a woman walking through a construction site or garbage dump, this film is for you. If not, do yourself a favor and pass it up.There are plenty of good Russian movies. This is not one of them."
1,didn't work for me,"I put batteries in and plugged into my computer like instructed. Supposedly everything was downloaded. I turned it on and put it outside so it could find location. I pplaced it where it couldn't be seen near rear windshield. Green light was blinking. When I plugged it back into computer, not only did it NOT have any information about where car had been, the computer said the device wasn't detected!!!!. Tried to contact mfr help, but didn't get any satisfaction. If I hadn't already thrown away packing slip(spouse almost saw it!....he's the reason I got it), I would have sent it back."
2,It works. No surprises.,"The Hepa air filter design is relatively simple: Air intake, filters, blower port, speed selector, done. Works as expected. Purchased for a nursery."
1,worse than even rollerball,"if u look at the title all i can say is ""need i say more"". i am not writing a review on rollerball right now so i wont go into depth. i did rate it one though. once upon a time is horrible, revolting, unwanted, terrible and any other word that gives you the idea. there is somthing i like about it though.........................................................................nice cast"
2,BONUS TRACK CUT SHORT BY 14 MINUTES,"Nothing more needs to be said about this great album. It is indeed a classic. The idea of adding the live track of Pick Up The Pieces from the Montreux Jazz Festival was a great one that made me purchase the CD - only to find out that the original 22 minute jam session had been cut to 7 or so minutes. WHY? The disk has over 20 minutes of blank space, so it wasn't because there was no room.It could have fit with room to spare. The full version is one of the greatest jam sessions you'll never hear unless you have the original 2 lp set from that time. It is not available on CD. The fact that some genius made this decision is mind boggling. Because of this I can only give it 4 stars. With the full version it would go beyond the 5 stars allowed to a 10."
2,Good battery life,"Charges quickly, lasts a long time, fairly light. Do yourself a favor and run the battery down instead of leaving the laptop plugged in all of the time. These batteries only last 12-16 months with any moderate capacity, and will last longer if you don't keep them fully charged 100% of the time."
1,THATS ALL THIS IS,MAKE BELIEVE what is this some kind of retro-pop culture crap. This is most certainly not rock. I saw this crap on MTV (I was stupid for thinking they would play somthing good) for some kind of queer countdown. Dont listen to this how can you and the other supporters of WEEZER actually listen to this music. What are you trying to do.Dont support this band they made it by doing simple riffs that you can play yourself and a beat that you used to do on your pots and pans when you were 3. Why pay money to listen to yourself. This is for your own good walk away while you still can before loose your diginity.
1,Not As Good As I Thought....,"'The Wall 2000' is only a tribute album from the band 'Out Of Phase.' It Hardly Sounds Anything Like Pink Floyd. It's Like A Combination Of Techno Mixed With Rock. All Of The Songs Have A Techno-Funk Style To Them. A Few Of Songs Are Decent, But Most Of Them Are Too Much Like A Limp Bizkit/Korn-Type Of Style. I Would Not Really Recommed This Album To Any One Who Is Just A Basic Floyd Album Collecter. This One Is Mainly For EXTREMLY HARD-CORE Pink Floyd Finanics."
2,Diamond Stud Earrings,"They are very small , & shiny . I don't wear them , My wife does . She could write a better review ."
2,I'm Glad I Bought This CD,"I Bought This CD Because Of Walkin On The Sun. But When I Listened To ALL of the songs on it, most of them SHOULD be hits. This band can do anything. From the hard rock of Flo to the Soft Rock of Why Can't We Be Friends."
2,Perky-Pet Window Wild Bird Feeder,"The Perky-Pet 348 Window Bird feeder works great ! Our Low Country South Carolina cardinals, finches, and wrens love it ! And we do, too. It's great to watch our birds feeding through the see-thru feeder. And, the low price makes this feeder the best value. Heartily recommended."
1,MIssing Parts,"I wouldn't know if I like this bed or not. I ordered it over a month ago and still don't have it set up. Our son was really looking forward to using his ""big boy bed"", however it has been a nightmare so far. We received the package, and opened it, finding no hardware or instructions. I called the manufacturer and they said they would sent them to me. Two weeks later we get hardware and instructions and sit again to assemble. We find out we are missing all of the support slats for the bottom. I call the manufacturer again. Three weeks later the slats come, so we sit down again to put it together. So page 3 and 4 are missing from the instructions ... we figure it out. Guess what? There are 2 screws/bolts missing. Still in a crib."
2,C S LEWIS,I LOVE ALL THE C S LEWIS BOOKS AND MOVIES. I ALSO GO TO THE THEATER TO SEE THEM.. GREAT!!!!!
1,Watch the TV series,"Attempts to combine comedy into an action movie. Well, its not very funny and not very exciting. If you are a fan of the old TV series, you will be disappointed. Stick to the TV series."
1,Terrible...full of useless vocabulary,"We are fans of Adam Sandler and have enjoyed many of his movies; however, we stopped this one shortly after starting it. The language was unnecessary and not funny at all."
1,Not for me...,"I didn't care for this because of the strainer. It didn't strain out all the tea, which is why I bought it."
1,Too Many Mistakes,"I was considering buying this book for a birthday present but fortunately happened to see a copy in my local library. It reads easily but has several gross historical and geographical errors which make me wonder about the accuracy of the facts in the rest of the book. The most egregious of these errors (page 66 and elsewhere) places the Cumberland gap near Cumberland, Maryland, when in fact it is at the Kentucky / Virginia border some 400 miles to the southwest. Also, I wonder about the cotton mill in Utica, New York in 1811 (p-150). How did the unspun cotton get from the south to a frontier town in upstate New York at that date ? I feel that there is simply no excuse for any non-fiction book on a historical subject to be marred by errors which could and should have been easily detected."
2,Germany's right arm for both World Wars,"Ever wondered how a country the size of Montana could nearly conquer the continent of Europe twice in 30 years? The answer is Krupp. From artillery to tank armor to whole U-boats, Krupp produced it all. This book traces the companies roots back several hundred years, culminating in their efforts during World War One and Two. While this book is informative and has a good flow for its subject matter, it's best read by serious history buffs only."
1,Not for me,"It was not at all helpful to my skin. I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it. I found my answer but, it is not Rosewater. This sits under my sink and maybe i'll mix it with my Indian clay or something. May work for some but, not me."
1,"Very outdated, very basic","This book was published in 1945. It is 9""x6"". There are 132 pages, all B&W; photos, B&W; silhouettes of the planes in question. There are many errors in the text & captions. Some line drawings and cut aways are included in the text. The author gives an overview of the principles of flight, engines, and airframe designs.For the time, it would have been a good intro to WW2 aircraft, although only British, US, German and Italian designs are included. One of the things I did like were the comparisons of one plane to another. However, the author skips around a lot from fighter to bomber back to figher, etc.I spent $10 on the book back in 1993 and was disappointed."
1,this cd rom is not wroth the money,"This cd rom is not worth the money. It is worth $20 at the most. Don't buy it unless you want to watse your money. The analysis is terrible and very general. Teen magazines are better at giving out questionairs compared to this book. The hard copy is cheaper. If you need it for class, go for a hard copy."
2,Works like a charm,"I have 2 cairn terriers and this works great to keep the hair quanity down in the house. They do look like they have been groomed especially the wheaten one. The Brindle we have looks a little less groomed, I guess since her hair is just more wiry. It's made such a difference in appreciating their hair coat."
2,"Fascinating approach, could use more meat","I liked the book, I like the approach, but it falls short of what needs to be done to be a truly useful tool for job hunting. As I read it the burning question in my mind was, would What Color Is Your Parachute be a better tool? I actually pulled my two year old copy of Parachute off the shelf and it is a better tool.Still the book deserves a flip through if you have a chance to pull it off your neighbor's shelf or check it out from a library. My favorite chapters were 3 and 4, if there is any chance you might be looking for a job, don't miss those."
2,"C to the H to the R- I- S, I say yes to your album","Damn, I bet Chris is getting all kind of shortie with this tight album.Chris Brown's debue album is pure R&B; gold, his songs have all the right things in all the right places. From the Intro to the ending track, Thank you, you'll be chillin' with ya homeboys to an album that puts anyone from 50 to the Peas too shame. It's pure R&B; with the perfect dash of hip-hop. Plus you got a remix of Run It! with Bow Wow and Jermiane Dupri. Say word!Man, Virgina will be representing Chris prodly for years too come. You can't go wrong with this album."
2,Problems with S-Vid connection,"For the most part, this player is pretty good. I havent had any problems playing back dvds of various formats. However, the S-Vid connection is not good. My old DVD broke, I didnt feel like ripping apart my whole entertainment center to get to the back of my TV. Im buying an LCD this year so I figured id wait. My old DVD was hooked up via S-Vid so i just reused the same cable. Anyway, Everytime I play a DVD, It only shows up in black and white. I have to keep ""fiddlin"" with the S-VID plug to get it to show color. It only takes a sec and seems to hold for a whole movie, so its not so bad. I gave 4 stars cause 1) S-Vid is old (and lame) and 2)It could possibly be my cable and not the player at all."
1,travel help,"this was my second version of Streets & Trips - loved the first one! not happy with this version at all. wouldn't allow me to update it, no contact for technical issues, and then, when I tried to load it on a new computer with Windows 7, it wouldn't work at all. Microsoft's lovely website for compatibility issues says it does work with 7, but it sure doesn't with mine."
2,Excellent Popcorn and Healthy Too,I've been eating this popcorn for years. It is always cruchy and consistently excellent. I highly recommend it.
2,Ditch the choir!!,"Clay's golden voice is wonderfully showcased with these songs. I can't wait to see what he does on his upcoming album! My only reason for giving a 4 star rating is the hideous sound of the choir on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" If I never hear them again, it will be far too soon. Clay, however, is absolutely brilliant, in both of his passionate performances. My advice to this rising young star with a bright future ahead of him--ditch the choir!!"
2,Spin-tacular,"I put one of these in my refrigerator to organize my condiment bottles, and it looks and works beautifully. If you have stainless steel in your kitchen, and you have OCD, then you need at least one of these and probably more."
2,Hellbender Review,"Yes, this game is a dinosaur in the reckoning of technology years, but I love it because it brings back memories from my childhood of playing similar games with my older brother. If you are only interested in playing games with cutting-edge graphics, this is obviously not a game for you, but if you have a hunger for something nostalgic, you may want to check this one out."
1,home defence pastry traps,"I thought the product would work better then it did,the attracter did not seem to attract much of anything,I ended useing a spray to get rid of the pantry bugs I would not recommend this product"
2,"Hugh Masekela ""Sixty""","I have several of Hugh Masekela's albums, and like all of them. However, his CD's tend to be repetitious, with a few new songs on each one. I like ""Sixty"" even though it has an ""old feel,"" because I like his jazz and blues style with it's South African flavor, yet, his music could be surprisingly mainstream for the World genre. He is a mainstay in my African music collection, which is sort of large. This is pretty much easy listening, except for ""Tamati So So,"" which I have on my iPod and use for exercise, which sticks out because of its Caribbean flavor. This isn't my favorite Hugh M. CD, but it's a keeper and definitely a collector's item."
2,Can't Wait,"I am looking forward to getting this dvd. The special features may not be good, but at least we are getting the season (better than the volumes)!"
2,Pure American Metal At Its Best,"Lamb of God is the future of American metal and ""Ashes of the Wake"" proves it. This album tops their other releases: the riffs are brutal, the vocals are intense, and the drumming is the best its been on any Lamb of God release. This band one day will be the new Megadeth or the new Slayer. If I can see one down fall, its the vocals. They are very death metal-ish, and that may hurt the bands success. But for a metalhead, they fit the music well. Bless the metal gods for this release."
2,"Not the best season, but still AWESOME!!","I bought this season of Alias after having seen it a few times already. I had all the other seasons, and when I got my husband watching them, we decided to complete the collection. It isn't the best season of this series, but that is perhaps personal preference. We have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not really appropriate for kids, but if you're looking for an addictive season, this is it. You'll stay up nights watching ""just one more episode"" and ""just one more."""
1,LETS JUST SEE ABOUT THAT!,"MY SCENE ARE PUT WITH THE BARBIES AT THE STORE. BARBIE IS NUMBER ONE! SHE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE! AND AT THE STORE THERES WAY MORE PEOPLE BUYING MATTEL PRODUCTS! 14 GIRLKS MIGHT OF LOOKED AT THEM, BUT 14 GIRLS MIGHT NOT OF BOUGHT THEM!"
2,Way better than the movie,One aspect of this book that is undermentioned is the impact of having a hellish boss. I read this book when I was in that situation and it helped me have some laughs along the way. Other than that it is a little fantasy land to drift off to on a vacation. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend is truly examined in the book - a major piece that was likely left out of the movie due to timing.
2,Second Movement,"Concerning the tempo fluctuation at the beginning of the 2nd movement, I suggest checking the score, with a metronome in hand. You'll find that Abbado adopts 66 to the bar starting on bar 5, as written. All other versions I've heard (20+) use 60 from bar 1, including the presumably authoritative Bruno Walter interpretation, and Abbado's earlier Chicago version. It's no exagerration to say that Abbado's BPO version is the only one that's true to the score on this point.Note that Mahler's programatic description for this movement was `Full Sail!'; one can imagine this clipper catching a steady wind on bar 5.Overall this is a very fine recording, and merits a place in a well stocked Mahler collection. Bernstein, Kubelik, and a few others also stand out, and this is certainly a crowded field."
2,Best info,Really enjoying the info loaded inthis book. I love hoe it adjusts the training to the disability. I highly recommend it!
2,Great Guide,"This guide to Rayman 2 is everything that you will need to be able to complete the game. This guide will tell you where to find every lum, every bonus and all of the cages. There are detailed maps telling you the location of everything that you need including the masks. This will make the game easy for you but if you can do it without the guide then i would recommend that you do that as you will have more satisfaction in yourself for being able to defeat it without any help. (if not buy this guide)"
2,Adam Green is the newest Hans Christian Anderson,"adam green's ""Gemstones"" is a wonderful collection of fun ditties that brings one's inner child. The songs remind one of nursery rhymes sung by a 30-year-old child. every song evokes a feeling of happiness. five stars to the new master of children's songs for adults."
1,Not what I thought I was getting,I don't think there is anything wrong with the product. But I thought I was just buying Couscous I didn't know there were different types also there were NO instructions how to cook It.
1,mother looking for all the answers,"I have to admit that I read this book all the way through, and tried all the suggestions only to find that my son did not respond to any of it. He is eight weeks old now and only waking once through the night after my husband and I tried our own method. And I think thats pretty good. This book says to wake your child to get them on a routine which made him more irratable and less apt to fall asleep for more than 20 minutes at a time throughout the day and the night. Now I let him sleep as long as he wants. He is much happier when he wakes up.I wouldn't tell anyone to pratice the methods in this book."
2,Bratz Cloe,When Cloe Came out in Australia I Know I Had to Get Her. I have over 50 Bratz dolls and she is my fave Doll. She comes with the coolest PJs and the softest hair she is the best doll EVER!!!!
1,Earbuds failure,"The product arrived in a timely fashion. The sound was good for the price point, BUT, one ear bud has failed within a 4 month time frame. You get what you pay for."
1,GLAM,I got the R rated one wanted nc-17. ( hope its better) slow no action too speak of. had a standout cast too.
1,does not work too well for small amounts of gas in tank,I tried to remove gasoline from my snowblower tank and couldn't maintain a continuous flow to siphon 'all' of the gas out of the tank. It doesn't work for small amounts of gas in the bottom of the tank. I'm going to try Terapump rotary manual drum pump which has good reviews.
2,cute,"Sammy is a classroom guinea pig. He is usually very happy. He has all he could ever ask for. He has food and water, clean cage, and good friends who care for him. One day the children notice that Sammy seems sad. He makes a fuss while the teacher is trying to teach. The kids try and figure out what is wrong. They make sure that he is healthy. Then soon discover that Sammy is just lonley and wants some attention.In the end of the book was a list of facts about guinea pigs. I learned a lot from this list.Yes. This would be a great read aloud for a classroom that has a pet guinea pig."
1,Dissapointing,"I looked forward to seeing the film version of John Wyndham's book, ""The Midwich Cuckoos"", and was quite dissapointed when I finally did so. The film failed to create a sense of horror, by rushing through some key scenes and leaving others out altogether. Many consider this film to be truly frightening, and a classic of the horror genre, but I feel that true horror in a movie comes mostly in the suspense. Not in the horrific actions the monsters ARE engaging in, but the wondering of what exactly will those actions be, and when and where will they occur. A few slap dash moments of glowing eyes folllowed by a quick murder or two don't add up to horror for me. I found myself growing increasingly bored by this film, which is suprising considering how short it is. From the first moment the action occurs way to rapidly; no time is given to slowly unveil the horror, bit by bit. I was left with the overall feeling: who cares?"
1,Don't do it,"These are terrible tapes. They are not professionally filmed. The instructors are not professionals either. The whole instructions for a dance is about 2 minutes. You watch them dance the steps, facing you which doesn't work very well, and then they turn on the music and they dance until the song is over. That's it."
1,You'll get what you pay for.,"I was excited to get such a beautiful set of copper pans for such a low price, however, I was disappointed. They are lightweight (not much copper), and they don't conduct heat nearly as well as my more expensive copper pan. But what is even more disappointing than the food sticking (especially in the fry pans--I can't make a crepe in these without ripping it) is the horrible yellow color they are turning. While my expensive copper pan has developed a beautiful deep red patina, the Calphalon pans have ugly yellow and brown splotches all over them. I wished I would have just saved my money on the Calphalon set and bought just a couple of well-crafted copper pans instead (Mauviel, Falk, or Bourgeat). I feel like I got cheap copper pans at a cheap price."
2,Good Math Book/Program,"I am a homeschooling mom. We have used other math programs in the past, but this is certainly the best! It is very easy for the teacher (me) and student to understand. I wish we'd used it all along our homeschooling journey."
1,She is ugly and so is her music,this cd is just pathetic@ every song is the same i can'tt even tlell the differnece between them... she screamstoomuch. carrie if you wantt omake a good cd than stop singing slow boring songs
2,Great,"This is a really good supplement. Energy did increase. BUT BE AWARE THESE ARE HOURSE PILLS. The pills are huge. I didnt have too much trouble, but if your a person who can not swallow pills, skip this product."
1,thumbs down,"i found this book really over-complicated and difficult to use. the language used to write it is a totally bizairre mix of technical jargon and casual writing. the book, although claiming to be mac friendly is not at all and only shows images of PC interfaces, leaving mac users to figure things out on their own. i've gone back to using the skinny little manual that came with dreamweaver. this book is useless to me; it's one for the circular file."
1,TOO LONG!,"Certainly this novel contained some interesting and insightful observations about American society, but generally, it disappointed. The ""mystery"" dragged through the first two thirds. Each chapter ended with an annoying pseudo-suspensful sentence that lead... nowhere. There was no character development beyond the initial impressions/sketches of each person, including the protagonist, Talcott, who remained a drip to the end, and his wife, ""Kimmer"", who, impossibly, grew more and more evil with each chapter. (Yet he loves her so!) There were, in fact, too many characters to keep track of or care about, especially in the law school. The political musings detracted from the story rather than adding to it. (At one point, Talcott walks past some sort of sub-par ghetto grammar school, and wishes his colleagues who don't support school vouchers could see this proof of their need. What?) The ending was corny and cliched. And did I mention it was too long?"
1,Not satisfying,"This book read easily, but had major problems. It was a good idea for a story, but lacks essentials for making it a good read (for me anyway.)There is no character development, you just never really get to feel anything for any of the characters. I kept reading, trudging through the story line that continually jumped from one story to another and then thinly tries to tie them together, so that I could get to the end. You have to know ""who done it"" in a murder mystery right? Well don't keep reading, the nice neat ending will never come.I just wasn't satisfied, I was still scrolling looking for more pages!"
1,A great workout but...,This is a great butt-kicking workout but you had better like Jillian's voice because you will have to listen to her introduction each and every day because you can't MENU out of it! I find this so irritating that I'll never buy another one of her DVDs.
1,Awful,"When I first bought this CD, I was hoping for a greatest hits, like many of the other reviewers it seems. When I popped it into my CD player, I immediately knew that something was up. I scanned through the rest of the songs and couldn't believe what I was hearing...this was not the Bon Jovi that my mom and aunt had introduced me to all those years ago. Needless to say, I got rid of that CD the same day I purchased it.Now, I do applaud BJ for trying out something new with their classics (much like ""Crossroads"" ""Prayer 94""), but it's just not right. If you want to try a new sound, try it out on a new CD; leave your old gems alone.In a nutshell, leave this disaster on the shelf. It almost hurts listening to all of their classics ""sung"" like this."
2,"First time I read it, hated it-now, I love it!","I am an avid reader. I love both old and modern classics. This book was recommended to me by someone and I couldn't even finish it. I hated it. The simplistic writing style was unexpected and insulting. Years later, I came across the book again and reread it. This time I had no expectations for it and I was prepared for the fact that it is a simple fable. It is now one of my favorite books. It is easy to get caught up in the great complexity of life. This book is a reminder that deep wisdom can be obtained from simple lessons. This book is also a reminder that we all have a purpose even when our journey seems pointless. The book had to be simply and ineloquently written, that's the point! You don't have to possess great intellect to fulfill your purpose and find happiness in life."
1,A must have for your Leapster2,"If you buy a Leapster2, don't fail to also buy this adaptor. Your child will love his Leapster2 and if you have the adaptor as well, he won't be frustrated by running out of batteries. Plus, you'll save money."
1,Painfully bad,"I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, ""secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge"".The military uses the term ""blivet"" to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie."
2,A really great little game,"I've bought the game boy advance in the hope that one or two strategy games or role playing games would come along. This is the first strategy game I've bought for the console, and I am not disappointed. It boasts an excellent tutorial that walks you through the functioning of each unit and various strategies for success. The game, though intricate, is not very difficult to learn/play. My only complaint, which is slight, is that there is no way to adjust the difficulty in a Campaign game.Great game, which I imagine would only be more fun with two players. Highly recommended."
2,Trammps review,"Great CD by a great group. I bought the original 7"" vinyls in the 70s' when first released and now the originals have beenre-mastered they sound fantastic on CD.Trusting heart & where do we go from here are fantastic."
2,Grab this grabber!,"I have had two other grabbers before and this one rocks my world! I just got done with a heavy-duty abdominal surgery where bending is a challenge. This grabber has helped me keep my footing at times (not recommended as a cane, but I have leaned on it a little) and has reached places where other grabbers cannot go.The construction is awesome and the accuracey (preciseness) of this grabber is fantastic. Would I trust it taking a jar off of a shelf? I don't think I would trust any grabber for that. This one is perfect reaching for that kleenex you dropped, keys, cell phone, whatever. It's really a nice grabber.Highly recommended."
1,Not received the product yet.,"The seller said the product had sent one month ago, but I havenot received the product yet."
2,Memories of Chewie,"This kind of makes up for the terrible way Chewie dies in Vector Prime, but not quite. the only thing I personally HATE about this comic book is the way the author makes Princess Leia sound like a selfish brat."
2,Great book!,"This book is one of Ed Yound's finest. It is very beautifully rendered in a sort of abstract, pen and ink style which is very dramatic and striking. Anyone who enjoys myths from around the world will be charmed by this story and the way it is presented. I have bought this book for several people and it has been very well received by adults and children alike!"
2,complete,"Real L Word fan a ""must have"". All DVDs were in perfect format and quality was high. Box set is compact and stacks well."
1,"Wish I could give it ""-10""!","Deader (7) wasn't all that bad compared to this piece of crap. I wish they would revive the series by actually having a good director, writer and definitely actors. It would be so cool to see a hellraiser at the theater again. Please skip this one it gives bad a new name."
1,Poor Product,"I ordered this ir for my gransons birthday and the parts didnt fit correctly, one piece had been broken and glued back on it had dents and a gouge around one of the holes to attach one of the rungs. I only paid 14.99 two weeks ago and now they are wanting $39.99! For the quality and what we had to do to fix and assemble this chair this price is outrageous!! Its very soft wood, pine for sure! They need to reapply the $14.99 price for sure not worth a penny over that> Very dissapointed in this chair. Never have I had a bad experience buying from amazon until now. Will be weary of items purchased now."
1,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","This would be a great submarine sim (I love submarine sims!) if the software worked. It doesn't. Further, UbiSoft's technical support is abysmal -- ""Just do a clean reinstall and start over.""1.) Game crashes and/or freezes frequently.2.) Saved games are arbitraily lost.3.) Time acceleration can dump you in the midst of attacking destroyers and bombers, even if it's the middle of the night in a rain storm. Sometimes, the destroyers are invisible!4.) When you try to upgrade your submarine, you die. Only, you don't know it until the next time you start the game.My machine may not be the hottest thing going, but it's plenty good enough to meet the stated minimums for this POS.Summary: This is a potentially wonderful sim wrtten by crappy programmers. If you get it for $9 you paid too much. If you spend your $ on this, good luck."
2,genius of melodic pop,"For me, the criteria for judging the relative genius level of a pop songsmith is how well a song and its melody sticks with you. Prefab Sprout have it all down - all sewn up. How can I ever get out of my mind the irresistible melodies of ""Carnival 2000"" or ""Life Full of Surprises""?Sorry if I have the song-titles wrong or if I don't know the guy's name( Paddy MacLoon?).Names and song- titles are left-brain stuff.Bottom-line is that melody affects the right side of the brain and that's where these songs stick.Genius pop in the vein of the best of Brian Wilson or Lennon-McCartney or Supertramp."
1,Crying Shame,"I own some much better books written by Maggie Shayne; please don't judge the author by this story. I couldn't find the will to finish more than half. Maybe it was written by the author as a pre-teen? If so, it would explain quite a bit. Not worth the time it took to download."
2,"A well done manual, no bells or whistles.","Martin Koch has written a very good book on electric guitars. If you have no wood working skill or knowledge, he walks you through the basics, but that is not the point of this book. If you want to build an electric guitar, you ought to have at least the amount of skill and equipment that he outlines. But at the same time he offers an approach that those with few tools and a less than pro shop can handle.So a woodworking manual it is not, but for those of us who are skilled woodworkers, ( I am a professional cabinetmaker ) he offers a well thought out and methodical list of steps and processes to build a guitar. It is not a book for ""idiots"" , which is good, Koch respects his readers, but he also expects a degree of skill and thoughtfulness. A good book on the subject, my copy is already dog eared."
2,"Chakra Meditation Music,,, Merlins Magic","This is a nice CD,, I do enjoy listening to it but, have a couple that I like better..."
2,Durable and Fun!,"Lots of fun and SUPER durable! Our friendly big blue puppy is about to celebrate his 6th birthday and he doesnt look a day older than 1! My older children loved this dog, my youngest is under the recommended age for this toy but is already enjoying it very much with some assistance. Besides the durability my most favorite thing about this toy is the fact that it doesnt require batteries as there are no electronic parts to it! Ive heard many delightful and imaginative sounds being made while my kids are/were enjoying this fellow."
2,Unlikeable Character Makes for a Good Read.,"My sister gave me the book which she hadn't time to read. I was gradually pulled into this story. Hannah wasn't full of personality and a loner living on an isolated island. A nature lover, L.L. Bean kind of a girl, she liked the comfort of solitude. The reclusive artist, was very successful, but only one gallery seemed to be selling her work. Her friends, who were obviously much more talented, couldn't make a living selling art like Hannah did. Hmmmmm. This low key story will really grab your senses. The writer enables you to see, smell and feel the natural surroundings of the island and the peaceful feeling of solitude. Hannah's life becomes disrupted, beginning with Driftwood, the dog who found her island and makes himself at home. You can feel her disruption as people and events intrude upon her life."
1,Buy the Amplified Manic Panic Ultraviolet--not this,"After using the Amplified Manic panic ultraviolet on my daughters bleached hair for the past 6 months, I accidentally bought a tub of this, the regular stuff. Big deal, I thought it just won't last as long right? Wrong!!! It didn't take to her hair nearly as well. The top of her head came out close to right, but the length didn't take the color hardly at all, and actually came out looking greyish purple. From a distance it actually looked grey. I had the product thouroughly worked into her hair, and even left it on for about 6 hours under a cap. The product was the only difference from previous dye jobs. It is dramatically inferior."
2,Pure joy,"If you are a science fiction fan, then this book is among the best there is. period. The quality of the book, its characters, classic setup and clean science all make this a pure joy to read.The plot is the age old story of colony-fighting-for-independence-from-its-mother-country except that the colony literally stones the enemy to independent!The author uses a specific style of writing (mix of English slang with Russian mix) that unsettles you a bit early on, but actually becomes very much a part of the theme.Mike (our co-protagonist) even surpasses HAL (2001 Space odyssey) in terms of character depth. The part where ""s/he""tries to think up jokes is really hilarious :)Just pure joy."
1,Meh....,"Typical Uncle Mikes product. Its cheap and it shows, but it does its job and when it falls apart you can just buy another one."
1,Pretentious trash,"I find this book rates right up there with some of Norman Mailer's more incomprehensible books...boring and tiresome. It does, however, might good bedside reading. A page or two and you'll be sound asleep."
2,Great for Gaining Muscle and Cutting Fat,"Chances are if you're reading this review, you already know how great Glutamine is. In case you don't: it helps you build muscle, lose weight, and protects your muscles to ensure that as you're losing weight, you're cutting fat instead of muscle. This is one reason you'll see Glutamine as a key ingredient of most weight-loss supplements on the market. As a result, it's a great thing to add to your protein shakes no matter what your goal is - cutting, gaining, or maintaining.As with its Creatine and Gold Standard 100% Whey, Optimum Nutrition excels at giving us simple products at affordable prices without a bunch of glitz and extra junk we don't need. Just add a teaspoon of this to a shake or smoothie 2-3 times a day to help boost your progress, no matter what your goal is, and you won't be disappointed."
2,It is a easy learning book !,This is a really good book. It presents all the idea so clear with many graphs and figures. That make you feel comfortable to keep on reading. Also the contents are not so hard. It is a really good book for the beginner who want to know more about meteorology.
1,Didnt work,Ordered the thermostat and had our electrician install it. When we went to program it kept showing an error message. Honeywell informed the electrician to return it after running several tests. Emailed the sellers YB Lighting. They gave me a number to call. When called numerous times the phone would just ring. Avoid this seller at all costs!
1,"ok, flimsy, doesnt fit quite right","This product is a little flimsy and doesn't fit quite right under the sink. I think it's a little too bulky for something that is supposed to increase storage. Works ok, but is too much of a hassle to return."
2,"great ""pick me up""","It probably helps to have seen and loved the movie, as is the case with us. Ann-Margaret is close to perfection, and surprisingly, Dick Van Dyke is no slouch, either! Lots of fun."
2,"Living, Dying, Caring: Life and Death in a Nursing Home","I read this book from cover to cover in the space of an afternoon. The true stories were engaging and poignant and the reflections provided by the authors on each situation are an invaluable resource to anyone working in healthcare.I would also strongly recommend this book to anyone with a parent or family member living in a nursing home (particularly in Australia). It gives you an insight into the day to day running of a nursing home, the dilemmas faced by staff and the quality of care which should be provided. The book includes descriptions of times when a high quality of care was provided, and also times when a situation could have been handled better. This book is also a good introduction to some of the key principles of palliative care."
1,Great performance and recording but why such a poor transfer?,"This is the remaster by RVG, 24 bit transfer reissue produced by Michael Cuscuna I have been comparing to my friend's 1987 transfer by Ron McMaster also produced by Michael Cuscuna.Apart from the fact that the remaster is much louder and compressed, I was staggered at the difference. Stanley Turrentine's sax is so important to many tracks and drives the rhythm as much as the rhythm section itself but it has lost much of its exquisite contrasting soft/hard expressive qualities, almost like it's been added on top in the new version. Everyone seems to be playing in isolation and the drums are so much louder in the mix I can't believe this was all done with only a 2 track master, that is quite an achievement. Even the organ has lost much of it's ""watery"" quality. There's just no space left, most of the exquisite pauses are missing, dynamics and much of the texture are all gone. To make everything worse the noise floor even sounds way higher."
1,Very misleading Total Cardio Mix DVD,"Unfortunately, this DVD is totally misleading. I purchased it as it states there is ONE DVD with Quick Blender for over 100 combinations of Kickboxing and Cardio Hip Hop. Amazon states it is one DVD and the back of the box says to mix and match the 8 ten minute segments. Why the back of the box says...""two heart pumping,innovative workouts togehter on one DVD, you'll never be bored again"", is very unclear.There are TWO DVD's in this box, so if you want to purchase to separate workout videos, that is what you get here. I personally was looking for a mix and match combo.~ Lee Mellott"
1,Do not purchase!,"I have returned this now three times. You are supposed to pry the gray cap off the end, remove the hose inside, screw it into the pump itself and then screw the end of the hose onto the tire valve stem.The problem is that the hose does not screw into the pump. It falls out over and over. I feel a couple of little grooves in the pump for it to grab the hose, but it does not. The pump opening is too big.We were at Disneyland last weekend, one tire was low. The pump delated the tire completely and would not pump air into it at all. Thankfully Disneyland Stroller rental had a compressor ir it would have really been a problem."
2,My granddaughter loves it!,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, age 5. She loves to play with it and has had hours of fun with it. It is ratherflimsy made, the windows & doors don't stay in but that doesn't botherher. Overall, I am very glad I got it."
2,Play Misty for me is a true Eastwood classic!,Great Jazz music and truly a tutorial on avoiding wacky women with long knives. This movie will give players nightmares for life but it is a true Eastwood classic that is entertaining and instructional at the same time.
2,really like it,I really like this for my dog. It stops easily so she can't run too far. It appears to be well made. Good weight and sturdy.
1,A Nice Table if you could assemble it,"The finish and design are nice, but it was impossible to assemble the shelves. The grooves to insert the wood into were machined too narrow. After returning the item to Toys-R-Us, the manager informed me that he had seen 3 of these come back for the same reason. He said he had even tried to help someone else assemble it with a hammer and sand paper with no luck! Maybe they got a bad batch? I'd stay away anyhow."
2,Works for keeping cats out,"I have nosy cats that like to open any cabinet or closet they can get into. I was getting really sick of waking up every night to the sound of the cats opening the bi-fold closet doors in my bedroom and getting into trouble, so I bought two of these locks. They're very simple and do a good job of keeping the cats out. They still try to get in (sometimes I forget to slide them back when I close the doors), but when the doors are locked, they give up pretty quickly. The wands are useless, so I just slide the locks by the lip."
2,Good deal!,"Study, solid but still light. The front pocket is made of heavier material than the rest of it (black). Very handy. Good price"
1,Terrible writing,"This book was free (for the Kindle), and that's part of the reason I read it. The genre of alternative history has always been something that sounded interesting to me, but I'd never read any.Well, the writing is absolutely terrible: Cliches abound; literary crutches that didn't work a first time reused several times, sometimes within a few pages; terrible representation of Southern dialect; lots of things that just annoy the heck out of me.If I had realized this book was 640 pages long, I would have given up on it early. But, I'll give Turtledove this, I cared about a few of the characters and finished it up because I wanted to know what the heck happens. Unfortunately, it's part of a trilogy so I only got a small payoff at the end -- one I saw coming, at that. I won't be picking up the rest of the trilogy."
1,"Latter era Bo, none of his signature tunes...","Oh why can't we have Bo Diddley's ""Beach Party"" on CD, recorded live at Myrtle Beach in his prime, with all those great ""shave and a haircut"" rhythm songs for which he is so deservedly known. Bo isn't a funk artist, he's a pioneer of rock and roll."
2,Hysterical and very very very unique,"I had never read something like this before.In my opinion, David Sedaris is a very talented man, he has such a creativity and imagination to narrate things and events in such a brutal, honest and unique way that just make it hilarious.It suprised me how peculiar his family is, and how different they all are from one another. But again, the way he tells the stories are just funny.I do recommend it if you want to get a few laughs out of it. ^_^"
1,It's not rocket science.,"I'd return this paper towel holder if it were worth the time and effort, but it's not. You'd think assembly wouldn't be complicated. It's a paper towel holder for pete's sake. But the quality is shoddy, and the design is somewhat nonsensical. Paper towels easily fit through the center rod without removing anything. Great! So why, then, make the middle rod three separate pieces that need to be screwed together, as opposed to just one piece? Not so great. And upon screwing the middle rod to the base, the bottom of the base fell off. Because this is sold by Target, there's tax and shipping. So for about the same amount (maybe less), you can get a better made paper towel holder from Bed, Bath, & Beyond."
2,Exhilarating,This album is one of my all time favorites. I may even go as far as to rank it right up there with Aenema from tool. The songs are emotionally charged seamlessly blending together beautiful melody with hard hitting guitar riffs and earth shattering bass. Just an all around superb album.
2,nice phone for the price,"This is really a well functioning phone, nice and clear both ways, and I was able to give my son the other phone for his room upstairs; my only issue is that we mounted it where the other kitchen phone was on the wall, which was flat against the wall and caller ID was easily visible. This phone wall mounts at about a 45 degree angle, just drops into the cradle (careful not to knock it out), and is hard for my shorter wife to see the caller ID screen. However, it does announce the caller with a voice, pretty amazing technology...overall a good deal."
1,Tired exotica,"Let's be real. What gives this movie its ""charm"" is the fact that it plays on and reinforces every Western bias about the dangerous ""otherness"" of African culture. If you must, watch it for its cinematography and haunting score, but don't kid yourself about why it is so ""thrilling."""
2,A Great buy!,"I love my Zen. I've had it over a month now. The software is included, but you can use windows explorer to load it.Music, Videos, storage, Date Book, calander, Alarm Clock, Voice Recorder, and an FM Radio!It does way more than they advertise.It works with Windows, Yahoo Music, Audible Books and more.Right now I'm downloading videos from YouTube!I have never had to use the reset button.Right now there are hundreds of songs stored on mine, I lost count at 250!All high quality audio.Now the bad news. It is a little slow to start up.Go ahead and buy the (expensive) charger from the manufacturer.I have found nothing else that works.The screen it VERY bright in the dark, but still hard to see in sunlight.Most files will have to be converted. I've found free software for that.( www.Downloads.com ) YouTube Grabber, YouTube FLV to AVI Suite.This has been a good product for me. A Great buy![...]"
2,Well Made Product,This item was exactly as advertised. It is a well made and accurate measuring tool. A must for any upper extremity surgeon. It was shipped quickly and at a very good price.
1,save a few rock songs this band sucks,"Eagles suck in the rock world, they have a couple of rock songs but they are rock band......listen to hole in the world and you will agree. They sould like nsync...."
2,Its Great,I chose this as a step up from my Zeikos CPF for my Sony a57. This filter feels so much sturdier than my previous filter. The threads were clean and it attached fine. The polarization is great. I love the effects.
1,"Overly ambitious, inaccurate, political, immoral and archaic in language and form.","This book was extremely overly ambitious, trying to cover the origins of the universe alongside the history of Cna'an (including tiresome, somewhat alarming judicial records), all the while assuming moral and scientific superiority, without bothering to reference or prove the fantastic claims brought within.Even if we set aside the fact that most of the 'facts' related within this bronze-age book are in stark contrast to modern scientific thought, theory and fact, the format itself is somewhat archaic and unfriendly, with multiple errors and deviations on the translator(s?) side from the original Hebrew.I would not recommend this book be read to children, nor set as any sort of moral compass."
1,Surface Noise!!!!!!,"Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!"
2,Great person to buy from,I ordered this item for my father in law. I asked that it be shipped to him. The item was returned to the seller and she promptly refunded my money back with out my even knowing!!! THAT IS WHAT I CALL GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.
1,sucky,"OK, so Melanie Rawn's other series were good. Then I read this series, only to be shocked. I had to plow my way through the book. The only interesting parts were the treacheries and the like, and the abductions, etc. But overall, this whole series could not hold my attention, and let me tell you, if I'm reading a good book, my attention doesn't wander at all. Come on, when reading this series, it took about 4-6 weeks to read it, instead of the usual couple days. But maybe I shouldh've started with the 2nd book, like I did with all other Melanie Rawn series. I hope I never have to read it again, and that is an unusual comment for me."
2,Movie Script material.,"This book combined with it's sequil ""First Lady"" would make for an amazing movie packed with action, angst, humor, tradgedy, and BTW it's also a love story between two women who also have a family."
2,Fabulous!,Fabulous kids show! Love the lesson learned! Loved the crafts. Very user friendly format! Very funny! Are there more to come?!?!
2,Best American Government Textbook,"This book is kinda long winded, but only in so-far as it has complete explanations for the reasoning behind the writing of the constitution. Goes well with the instructional DVD from the National Center for Constitutional Studies."
2,On Time and In One Piece,I love this product. I don't know why it's so hard to find in stores. It's easy to create a picture book and the memories are forever.
2,National geographic's In the Womb,I teach jr. high science at a Catholic school. The eighth grade studies human development. This DVD is well done. The DVD focuses on the growth and development of the baby in a very tasteful way. My classes loved it!!
1,This band is awful,"Its kinda funny that slipknot sells albums because the only people that listen to them are 12 year olds and posers. I heard this album in my friends car stereo because we were satisfying his little brother. This cd like the others is just pure garbage and noise. Theres no talent to it, its like lincoln park they just write the same song about 30 times and give it a bad title. If you want real metal go pick up Slayer Reign in Blood and Seasons of the Abyss. Sepultura Arise and Roorback. Pantera Vulgar display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. The list goes on, and the truth of the matter is in 10 years slipknot wont even exist anymore."
1,Doesn't deserve a publisher,"I read De Angelis's other book which is hilariously bad. Her method for expressing emotions is to use bold face, italics, exclamation points. Sometimes she uses all of them in a single sentence. Her advice is vague and commonsensical: ""Judge a Man by the Size of His Heart, not by the Size of His Wallet"" or ""Look for a Man with Good Character."" Philosophers have debated for ages on what ""good character"" actually is. De Angelis pretends like the debates never took place. Falling in love is complicated business, and De Angelis evades the complexities for the shallower waters of vague cliche and trite observation."
2,Good....,"Great! It does exactly what it says it does, if it would charge the phone too, it would be awesome!"
1,Problem where you have other phones on the same line,"Works well except that when there's an incoming call that is picked up in one of the other phones in the house and it's for me, when I pick up my phone (the one connected to Comswitch)all I get is a busy signal. To pick up the call, I have to use another phone in another room. Is there a solution?"
1,Makes my dogs sick,"I thought this product would help my dog with digestion problems. She has a sensitive stomach and has previously benefited from enzymes and probiotics. Instead it made my dog cough and vomit. Even my other dog, who is less sensitive, vomited from this product. I do not know how to get a refund, but I wish I could."
1,Tastes horrible,"I tried about 3 of these tea bags & threw the rest out, they taste horrible, like musty old earth.I don't recommned it to anyone.I love green tea... this just tastes nasty, even tried putting lemon & honey in it, but it's still awful."
2,This is a great movie.,This is Richard Pryor's greatest movie ever. The index finger joke is the best. I also love how he swears behind the window. This is a must see
2,I was a happy camper,"I love slashers in the woods.Shame,that films like this doesnt exist anymore.With 80's actors that you must love,beautiful camp,sun and inventive murders,you can watch this film over and over again."
2,Very helpful,I am using this book for my MS in HR Management. I think this book is very helpful and has clear concepts about Knowledge Management.
2,Very Awesome,"So many different great theme s in this soundtrack,never get tired of listening to it.Love the ""Now We Are Free "" song sooo beautiful!"
1,GREATEST HITS COLLECTION BY THE EAGLES IS WAY BETTER!,Take my advice I recommend Eagles Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 volumes one and two is the definitive collection for the hardcore music fan out there. Because I have all these classic songs on my CD albums!
1,doesn't work,I would give this toy 0 stars if the defaults would allow. We received one as a birthday present. It would not light up. We returned it and got a replacement. The replacement does not light up. The phrases don't seem to be working right either but I can't tell for sure since I am not exactly sure what they are suppose to sound like. I think this toy would be really cool ....if it worked.
2,Blondie's lost star but still as sweet,"Blondie's 7th studio album No Exit don't reach the 5 stars which I would rate to the former Blondie albums. Screaming Skin, Maria, Under the gun, No Exit, Double take and Out in the streets are real Blondie classics: strong as ever. But that leaves 8 tracks on the album which don't have the catchy power/punk pop to which Blondie is famous for except maybe Nothing is real but the girl (the second single of this album).Nevertheless Blondie proved with this album that even in the ninety's they are able to release a good record.Maria and Screaming skin are the killers of the album."
1,LOL,"LOL, you have the group confused with someone else. ABC was never a boy band, silly. The music on this CD is their greatest hits compilation and it is very much a reflection of what they did while they were together. The guy on the cover is the singer and no one tried to pull anything on you, you simply ordered a CD by the wrong band. LOL"
1,"This item may not be square on arrival, if packaged/shipped by Amazon.","This is a precision tool. I bought this extra thick one because I need a nice square in my work. My order arrived in a box that was so poorly packed that I wonder about it retaining a real square. And this is the item I have to measure it with. This appears to be a fine tool, but you should buy it from a source that cares about packing it properly for shipment. Simply throwing it on the bottom of an over-sized box and then wadding and winding up brown wrapping paper on top of it only ensures that when it is dropped, that it can impact right on the tip and take it a degree out of square. If you need this tool to arrive in a box that does not invite damage, buy it elsewhere."
2,Incorrect video packages,"This is just to say that I have almost all of the Miss Marple videos and several have incorrect pictures on the jackets. For instance ""A Pocket Full of Rye""... has a picture of a scene from ""Murder At The Vicarage"" with Joan Hickson and Paul Eddington. There are a couple of others also. I makes it a little confusing when you go to choose one to watch. Thank you."
1,Great camera until the E18 failure,I have a Canon A70 that until recently was a great camera. On a trip to the Grand Canyon the camera failed. Lens would not retract and E18 error appeared on screen. I thought it was just bad luck until I got home and Googled the E18. Discovered that this was a common complaint and that it is a waste of my time to pursue this with Canon. I am now looking at other brands for a replacement.
1,Worked once of twice before they dried up.,"I bought a box of these for an art class I am teaching. After using once of twice, minimally, they don't work at all. Some of them didn't write, right out of the box. These are a horrible waste of money. I have to buy all new pens now, after just two uses."
2,An incredible book by an accomplished writer.,"David Simon's Homicide:A year on the killing streets is a glimpse inside a year he spent with the homicide division of Baltimore's police department. This jouralism is second to none. He has also created and written for The Wire an HBO show dubbed ""The best show ever made"" and Homicide on NBC in the 1990s based on this book he wrote. David Simon is responsible personally for choosing my career path today and his work is moving. If you haven't seen The wire or Homicide I would suggest this book first to get you started."
2,Libby 4 1/2 Ounce Spice jar with lid,"I LOVE these jars! I read other reviews and some of the info wasn't quite accurate. First of all, the full McCormick spices do fit in these jars, but just tap them a bit. No big deal. Secondly, to remove the stickers, just open the box from the bottom to expose the label, squirt with a bit of Windex, let sit for a few minutes and the labels rub right off. They seal nicely. My only gripe is that labeling the front of the jar doesn't work because of the curve. Avery makes label 22825 that fits PERFECTLY on the top of the jar, which worked well for me. I have my entire set of 48 displayed on a tiered shelf in my kitchen and they look amazing. In my opinion, these are the best I have ever found, and I have been looking a long, long time. There are others that cost a ton more money, but for the price they are perfect."
2,Horror story,"I rated this book 5 stars for one reason, and one reason only-- NOT because I like the book, but because it is very informative.This may well be the scariest thing I have ever read in my life!!It was very enlightening to read this book and realizing that several of our current leaders in the U.S. not only read and studied this book in college, etc.....but, that some actually believe in what it says and practice the principles of Saul Alinsky (even if you don't want to believe it-- get busy and do some ""homework"" on the topic. Facts are facts.)After understanding all of that and seeing the content of this book, if you aren't shocked, may God have mercy on your soul."
1,A Must Read,"I read this book along with several other ""travel books"" this summer and was startled by its genius.chatwin is a very captivating figure , a remarkable amateur traipsing through any number of disciplines en route, he hoped, to mankind's nomadic quintessence. Unlike other aspirant travel writers his books are clorful and detailed. He may have been wrong but he was brilliantly wrong."
1,Nintendo DS Lite Adapter,"This paticular DS Lite power adapter is quite frankly garbage. Yes it charges the DS Lite, but it also creates feed back noise in the speakers and a line runs from bottom to top on the screen. The Picture representing the item wass that of a Nintendo Certified Product. This is not what I recived...Also the cord is really really short only about half as long as the one that came with my DS Lite. Very dissatisfied with this product. I won't return it because the shipping is possibly more than what I paid for it."
1,Thoroughly mediocre,"I have a two hour commute each day and I'm trying to utilize that time in some positive fashion. I'm studying for the GRE and was looking for something I could listen to that would contribute to this goal/project. This was a waste of money, since I knew 98% of the words. Also, a few words I thought were not very well described, and the sentances were contrived. The way they use two words with the same root in a sentance seems to be a sure fire way in my book to help someone confuse the two words' meaning. On the plus side, buying this CD set has now made me see the futility of this method of studying for the GRE, and saved me from investing in a more expensive CD set. If like me, you're studying for the GRE, my advice to you is to set aside time to read scholarly journals or essay collections, dictionary in hand."
1,Not well written,What an unsatisfactory read.There are several pieces of information that just aren't threaded together. Some of the behaviors of the characters have no motivation.Sad. It couldn've been a great book.
1,DON'T BUY this CD,"I spend hours, like 12-15 at a time in airplanes. I love my Ipod. I love David Grey. I can't transfer songs to my Ipod from this disc. SONY needs to get a message. I will buy the bootleg version when I get to Asia in a couple of weeks for $1.50 . I never do this because I believe that stealing income from artists is so wrong. A special thanks to Amazon for the warning.MJD"
1,Saving Face-- in the dark,"The movie was great, that's why I wanted my own copy without commercials, etc.The copy was horrible. It was like the whole movie was in the dark, at night."
1,"Ladies and gentlemen, run, hide! BRITNEY'S BACK!","Ok, now I know at the beginning of Brit's career everyone embraced her as the new idol for young girls, but from recent appearances she looks and acts very far from that! There's been so much hype on this star that most people have felt it their duty to just buy her album to get her to shut up. The only reason that her CD is selling is for people to say to their friends ""Yeah, I have her new CD"" (come on, you know you do it!) I didn't actually buy the album, but listened to it at friends'. There are only two songs that I consider ""listener worthy"" (Stronger and Lucky). Just trust me, there's no reason to buy this if you really like good music. All in all, this big star is a big disappointment."
1,NEVER CAME,"I ordered this product about thw and a half weeks before I needed it for my childrens very first birthday party, I payed to have rush delivery and it never came. It took me like another week to get a refund, and they did not refund the rush delivery money, which was like $15!... I would never order from them again, I am soo upset, because by the time it was actually the day of my childrens birthday we were totally broke and we didnt even have any gold eating coins at their PIRATE party, It totally stinks."
2,"Yes, it's remastered!","A brief and to the point review to tell those waiting ""Buy this set."" The movie has been remastered and has Dolby 5.1. As with ""Dementia 13,"" the company Cultra has delivered the version you have been waiting for on Blu-ray or dvd. Buy it! I have a dvdr of MGM HD version and this looks about the same to me. I will take this set over my homemade dvdr any day. Too bad Sony dragged their heels on this one and all of the rest of the ""no brainer"" instant sale releases!"
2,Warning: Extremely technical,"This book is very technical, and not for a beginning tailor. However it is an excellent idea sourcebook for anyone recreating Tudor and Elizabethan costumes. Janet Arnold was able to examine surviving pieces of clothing from this period, and has given scaled pattern layouts for many of the garments."
2,One question...,"Why did Moira O'Hara age after her death? None of the other characters aged. And she became two characters of different age while other characters stayed at the age and level of maturity they were when they died.And everybody else kept their death wounds. Young Moira was shot through the right eye. Old Moira had that bum eye, but young Moira had both eyes.This is Really Important. Or not."
2,Wonderful Collection,"This is a fantastic collection of McGee's analysis of the Bible. Its much better and cheaper than buying each book separately. I have always loved McGee and have this in hardback along with Kindle and have also listened to him on the radio. There are a few times I have not agreed with him, but right or wrong, I like to read him, and when I can, listen to him. Well worth the money--you will not be sorry."
2,Decent pool for the price,"I bought this pool to serve as an indoor ball pit for my son's first birthday. We kept it as a ball pit throughout the cold months and in the summer time we used it as a pool. The only downside to using it as a pool is that the bottom is a thin sheet of plastic and so you will have to place it in the grass for comfort, as a concrete driveway would be too hard underneath your little one's bottom.The only other downside is that the one I received in the mail was a different pattern than the one advertised. I'm sure all of the patterns are appropriate for a girl, but I questioned whether or not the pattern that I received was appropriate for a boy. It was so close to his birthday party that I didn't bother to return or exchange it.We like this little pool. It doesn't loose air quickly either. I've only filled it with air once and 5 months later, it's still doing fine. At the end of summer, we will probably turn it back into a ball pit."
2,Family Conflicts In Genesis,This is one special book. The midrashic analysis is brilliantly presented. The material presented will make rich food for my Bible classes. I highly recommend this book to any who enjoy rabbinic midrashic study.Rabbi B. Eisenman
1,Tiny quantity Cheapie applicator,"The review title pretty much says it all. The quantity was not sufficient to fully lube my admittedly very dry belt and platform. I think it is probably .5 oz and not the .05 oz listed in the product specs, but even so there are much better values out there."
2,not my favorite but a good one,"this comedy, as all Sandler's movies, is to have a good time. Adam Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a single guy who ilegally adopts a little kid, and this last one will eventually become a part of his life. To take care of the child he decides to make a fantasy world without rules and obstacles; in other words, he loves the boy in a very special way. What makes you wanna keep on seeing the movie is that the central theme is seen as something not necessaryly serious, so it is fun to see what's gonna happen next with this particular pair of ""clawns"". I recommend it because of its joy-transmition and pretty funny ex SaturdayNightLive-actors. You won't regret seeing it."
2,Great for the money!!!,"I recently bought the JVC DVD player. The three disc tray is very helpful. It is a great looking machine. The JVC has good picture quality. It has quite a few extra features (most I will never use.) The price is what sells this. That is very hard to beat. It does have a couple drawbacks though:The remote control is awful. I dont know who designed it but it needs some serious improvements. Buttons our in awful places. Many buttons you will need to use our so small you have to be looking at the remote right up close to find it. The other main problem is the loading time. Once you put a new CD or DVD in, it seems to take forever to load. At the menu screens, you press a button and wait for about 7 seconds. This is much longer than it should be.Overall, I would recommend this product to people who want a new remote control and for people who have a lot of patience. Another reason, that great price."
2,Kun shoulder rest at a great price,This popular shoulder rest was a great value. It is the choice of students and advanced players in our area.
1,Not funny at ALL!!!!!,I thought Mike was funny. NOT ON THIS ONE! Saw a review and look everywhere for it. When I finally found it on Amazon I was excited for it to arrived. Would like to sell it back!
1,Bad Purchase,"This product is terrible. The volume is not loud enough to hear adequately, and the way it fits into your ear is uncomfortable. Do not buy this product, it is not worth the money."
1,Polemic Leavened with Invective,Islamic terror and its roots are an important and fascinating topic worthy of someone who actually speaks Arabic and is a scholar of the region's history. This gadfly book is composed mostly of invective and polemics. I recommend to anyone who seriously wants to consider this subject the work of Professor Bernard Lewis.
1,Misrepresentation alert!,"The play depicts Jesus as a homosexual. Need I say more?How can any reviewer describe a playwright that deliberates distorts the Gospel as a ""true Christian"" and get helpful votes?Is this not a blatant abuse of the voting system?One could (if one truly feels that way) praise the play in terms of clever lines and plot since that is subjective, but one cannot get away from the fact that the play is an outrageous misrepresentation of the Gospel."
1,"Great Content, Too Bad It's Unreadable!","Alton Brown's my favorite cooking expert, and his wit is evident...if you can read it. This bood was designed, apparently, as a high-school project: Multiple pastels, reversed out recipe text in teentsy fonts, and a lousy text-size/leading ratio makes this book very hard to read. I'll never get as much benefit out of it as I could have, had not a rand amateur gotten ahold of the page layout. The book is a solid 5 stars; the design and layout are 0 stars, which renders it a waste of money to me."
2,CTFAN,"If you can get past the sometimes utter lack of sound quality (oh, and you will) you'll find some kicking American rock and or roll, to quote Reverend Lovejoy. Try not to completely enjoy Faith Healer. I dare you."
2,its cool....but not that cool,alright....heres the low down... this game was awesome for about....hmmmm lets see.....2 months or so. It gets old pretty fast so if your interested in buying i would suggest that you rent it from a local video store before...see how you like it. if you love it...buy it. if you like it a lot but dont want to spend the money...maybe one of your friends has it. enjoy to the people who get it. its really fun. but beware for the future
1,limited appeal,"When you found this book, I hope you were not expecting beautiful photos of French Country or Classic styles of interior design. Instead, this book is the equivalent of a bad art house movie. It has out-of-focus pictures of grungy looking rooms taken at unflattering camera angles in bad lighting.If you are someone who likes to polish up ""diamonds in the rough,"" you may like this book. Because I think only people that can look at junk and find some intrinsic value in it will like this book. However, those people will probably like the book titled Big City Junk better."
1,Don't buy kindle edition,"I have a paperback version which is excellent to look up. Meanwhile, in the kindle version, there are many words left blank with no description, such as amalgam, antecedent...etc. I hope Harper Corp. should update and correct the errors soon."
1,Too long for a mediocre story,"I picked up this book expecting another fabulous historical from Stephanie Laurens, rich in characters and an intriguing plot. But the book was too long to support this plot, and the characters, especially the heroine, wore thin. One of Laurens' strengths as a romance writer is how well she writes the hero's journey to win over the heroine. And in this novel, the heroine's protestations are extremely weak and outcome is obvious from the beginning.The Lady Chosen certainly cannot compare with any of the Cynster novels, which have distinct characters and compelling romances. I fear the Bastion Club series is going to be 7 novels of retread ground, especially if Laurens is writing 2 per year."
1,Not like the first one,"This movie lost the original ""terror"" if you like to call it that way and now it's more like a sex movie instead of a vampire , good v.s. evil one. And the vampires themselves are not like the first movie, yellow eyes and scary."
1,PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,The second time i tried to use this thing it just busted!! it's not as near as easy at it looks. Putting it up is a huge hassle!! When i tried to call the maker to return it they gave me about five long distance numbers. I called all of them and finally i gave up when they just left me on hold for a half an hour. This Roll-Away hose it the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.
1,Get 2007 version,Please note to get instead the new great sounding Capitol 2007 release which has all 24 songs (includes both Volumes 1 & 2) plus one bonus and is very reasonably priced. The 2006 version has a recording flaw. This is a classic Christmas album that should be FULLY enjoyed and the 2007 is the best version out there!
2,Interesting account of Communist China,"This is a very comprehensive account of one family's endurance of Communist China as told from the perspective of one member of the family. At times, I think it's a little unbelievable in the detail that she knows about family members who were no longer alive when she wrote the book. However, the writing is easy and her descriptions emotionally charged. This would be an especially good book to read in preparation for a trip to China."
1,Made my temperature rise!,"I bought this item thinking it would be the perfect indoor outdoor thermometer, but I was way off! First, it would not recognize the remote temp at all. After trying several batteries and pushing the reset buttons they did find each other. One night outside though and again, it was lost. It seems the two could not be more than 15 or 20 feet apart or they did not share the signals. Even then, it was hit or miss. I was truly dissappointed and sent it back for a refund. Too bad they don't pay for the shipping, so I lost money and got my temperature up! Don't waste your time on such electronic thermometer devices if you live in a snowy cold area like we do. The batteries will not last outside in the cold and you too will be the only thing heating up! I hope this was helpful."
2,SPIES,ROTEKAPELLE'S INTELLIGENCE COUPS HAVE WON IT A (GRUDGING) PLACE IN THE MILITARY HISTORIES. THIS BOOK IS THE BEST TAKE ON THE ORGANIZATION. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL ANTI-TERRORISM WARRIORS.
2,"The biblical story of Moses, with illustrations & commentary","This 50-minute program from A&E;'s ""Biography"" series tells the biblical story of Moses, illustrating the story with footage from relevant locations in the Middle East and with artists' depictions of biblical characters and episodes. Jewish and Christian biblical scholars and others add background information, explanation, and interpretation.One commentator seemed overly confident that he knew what was going on in Moses' psyche, but other than that, I found the commentary interesting and helpful, and it didn't overwhelm the simple telling of the story.This video does a good job of bringing the story of Moses to life. I have used excerpts from it in teaching Judaism and Christianity to undergraduates and high school students, and I think it would also be an excellent resource for Bible study groups.(Also recommended: Orson Scott Card's ""Stone Tables,"" a novelization of the life of Moses.)"
1,wouldn't stay in pairing mode,"I returned it. -- I bought it as a gift and tried to help the receiver of my gift to get it to work, but it just would not stay in pairing mode long enough to get it to link with her cell phone. It did seem like a great item though, until the pairing malfunction - very lightweight and high quality materials."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I just bought this book and there is no answer key available, even from the publisher. You will have no way to check your work. It's basically worthless now and it is not a cheap book."
2,Great Primer,Good installation considering it is the first of a trilogy. I am going to see part two tomorrow and am very interested in seeing how the two mesh.
1,Unconfotable and possible wrist injury,"The trackball jumps a spot every now and then and after a while, the position of your wrist makes it painful to continue.I went back to my ergonomic Logitech."
2,Better Than I Expected...,It's about life/coming undone/it's over before it has begun/...thats pretty deep for a teenage girl band...very nice debut...
1,Look Elsewhere,"The writing in this book is just bad, more like a first novel than a classic. I couldn't get into the plot because the stilted style kept pulling me out of the story. I made it about 50 pages and couldn't stand any more. On to something else."
1,Lost wisdom,"T. S. Eliot asked,""Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?""This unintentionally bleak commentary on the state of psychological research will not help you locate any answers."
1,And the Best of the Worst of the Worst is:,"This movie ranks at the top of my Golden Turkey list, right along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". It is so-o-o bad it is actually good.Like many other bad movies, it was mocked and scorned by the guys on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and is still being watched and traded by the diehard fans.If you were to (purposely) get one bad movie this year, make it Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. It's a laugh a minute."
1,PURE CRAP!!! WASTE OF TIME!!,"I was so hoping this movie would be worth watching, yet AGAIN I was wrong. The sharks in this movie were a total joke. The so called ACTING was much much worse."
1,POOR MACHINE & TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO *NOT* BUY,"I have been very disappointed with this machine: poor quality printing, jams easily, feeds paper poorly, and the scanning has never worked.To make matters worse, the Brother's customer service is among the worst I've encountered."
2,love it,my son love collecting these games. right price received it in the mail in a few days after ordering it.
2,Beauty in the sense of the word.,"His realism is superb in the classic sense. He is one of very few artists who can capture intricate detail with shade and color. His paintings are so true-to-life that it sometimes takes a second look to realize that they are actually a work of art, and not a photograph. His subject matter, often scenes of the Hawaiian Islands, holds great meaning for those of us who live here, and he's one of the very best interpreters of our state's beauty. This book gives Gary's fans a fuller appreciation of his art, and the work that goes into the paintings."
2,Awesome!... but probably their last good release,"""Once"" and ""Wishmaster"" are my favorite Nightwish releases but I'm afraid that with Tarja leaving the band, they will suck with their next one. The band is known for having a great haunting female opera voice and they are giving that up. I very much doubt that they can find someone to match those vocals and as with every band that loses their vocalist (if the vocalist was unique like we have here), Nightwish are doomed to go back into obscurity and eventually die. Maybe someday they'll re-unite and do another album together, but by then it will be too late (see Iron Maiden)."
2,"Brilliant, though sometimes a rehash or older material","This BBC documentary is as impressive visually as ever, and if you haven't seen Planet Earth or The Blue Planet, it'll definitely wow you. However, there's not that much new in here, though there is a greater effort spent in linking the event to how it affects the different species. Would have liked to see new events, such as the butterfly migration in America; right now, it mostly comes across as material that's been done before. Still visually stunning, but not particularly new."
2,Who are these people?,"If people are wandering where they can find music these days, you don't have to ask someone with a red hat on backwards or a person with two heads, with three brains full of misenchanted T.V. and radio brainwash to Never hear about these kinds of bands. Please listen to this CD. It's one of the many out there with purely whatever....just don't turn your ears away without an introduction of.........Without further delay.....I.....present......Mourning Widows.....""and that's the kind of sh#t that's gonna happen!"""
2,Oklahoma,I am a trained singer and it is amazing the range this child has. Oklahoma is one of the most feeling songs I've heard in a long while. One Voice has earned it's place amoung my favorite cd's. Thanks Billy!
2,Gorgeous Fine China,This is the china set my husband and I chose. It is beautiful and high quality. It is a classic pattern that I can proudly pass on to future generations. I'm quite disappointed that it is discontinued.
1,It was fun for the 2 hours before it broke,"Our AirZooka lasted 2 hours. My grandson used it for maybe 30 minutes the first night. The second evening he used for about 90 minutes (not continously by any means)and the launcher broke. Yes, it was only $15 but he was really disappointed - and I can think of alot of things I would do with $15!"
2,Great Stockpot,"The Calphalon Stockpot is fantastic. It is the perfect size for making large amounts of soup, but not too large like the 20 quart sizes that you normally see. It heats up quickly and evenly and cleans up easily. I am now considering buying other Calphalon cookware and I would recommend this stockpot to anyone! The shipping was very fast and it was packaged well and secure."
1,Counterfeit or Expired,"Be cautious. I bought this cologne - which is sold and shipped by Amazon - and if it is not a counterfeit (I trust Amazon), it is expired. Its scent is weak and fades quickly. I am used to Lagerfeld's Photo and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least. I bought four of them, and I wanted to return the three unopened ones. This is what Amazon tells me:""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.""Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around. This is odd, to say the least."
1,DON'T LIKE,"I usually do my research before buying new products. But, didn't do as much when looking for a sippy cup. I thought this one would be better when compared to the others. I did speak with one parent and she told me it was okay, but showed me a defect with another well known brand. Well, I'm not pleased. The spout leaks and collapeses and is a bit too large for my son's mouth. I've tried loosening it a bit, but that doesn't help. I only use it when absolutely necessary. Will definitely not recommend this one..."
1,Hard to ride,My daughter was 3 when I bought her the scooter she is four now. She was never able to ride this scooter as it does not seem to be designed properly. Her left foot keeps hitting the back wheel so she can never get any speed -- i.e. she cant kick back. If she wanted to kick back she would have had to kick with her left foot quite far out from the scooter and that makes her loose her balance. So she kind of has to put her right foot on the scooter and jump on her left -- but eventually she will hit the back wheel with her left. I regret buying this. Also very cheaply made. Not worth the money. I'm a bit surprised about the number of positive reviews this scooter has received.
2,Item Shipped in Manuf. Box - Careful as Gift Purchase,"Just wanted to let everyone know to be cautious when purchasing this item as a gift for your wife etc. The item showed up in the manufacturers box, not in a separate box to disguise its contents. Luckily I went outside before she did and managed to hide it in the garage!"
1,WHAT A GYP,"I purchased this out of excitement that I would finally learn the truth to the controversy around the series' validity. Man, what a disappointment! They only devulge about three scenes, and pack the rest with filler, such as stock footage from the other films, and stupid commentary by horrible actors (noteably Dr. Louis Flellis). Don't bother to waste your money like I did. You're better off reading the various online critiques on the films' fakeness. You'll get much more info that way.--J.C. Hoyt"

1,I was almost burned by flames and sparks from this iron too!,While using this iron on 10/25/11 a burst of flames shot up from the base of the cord followed by a spray of sparks near my hand. The flames/sparks quickly stopped and I unplugged the iron. Upon inspection I found under the cord detangler wrap the power cord was burnt thru. The cord wrap cover made it impossible to know or tell that the cord may have been frayed or damaged thus making the iron unsafe to use. A poor product design that the Consummer Product Safety Commission needs to address. I will file a report and I encourage other to do so too.
1,A book with no clear examples. It's a big mess,I'm using this book as a textbook for my Electronic class. This book is useless because it seems like both were writing this book for him self. It's full and i mean full of equations. They forgot to mention what is meaning of thier equations. This new approch need to be written by some one have the students in mind.
1,waste of money,"The top didn't fit, wouldn't snap on. No directions to show if I was not doing it right, but what's there to do? Just snap it down. Tried as I could; it wouldn't go on. That's all she wrote. Going back to the store."
1,DONT BUY-Worked well first few times but died thereafter!!,"So I purchased the Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum with Powered Nozzle after reading the reviews on Amazon. I live in a 2Br condo and didn't need a super heavy vacuum for my place. The reviews looked impressive and so did the price, so I went ahead and bought this. The first few times were great- it is light weight, picks up pet hair, easy to maneuver. However, lately (only using it for 5-6 times), it has started turning off on its own. If you leave it on for a minute- it over heats and turns off. You need to wait for another 20 minutes before it runs again. I have tried emptying the dust cup etc but that doesn't solve the problem. Its a big waste of money!! Whats the point of light slick vacuum which doesn't work?! I would say it doesn't even do light pick up cleaning, its just badly designed and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it. Spend an extra $20 and get a better sturdy machine. This one sucks!"
1,It underestimates our inteligence.,"Ok, I've seen it after the american version and I was very disapointed. The problem is not the lack of special FX or the peculiarities of japanese culture, the thing is that in this version every single character seems to have paranormal powers, which is ridiculous. While in the american version the mystery is solved simply by examing carefully the images of the tape, in this one everybody has visions and dreams, which make the movie less rational (if we can say so of a horror movie). Also, the american version leaves more open doors to Samara's story (Sadako), this one tells everything."
2,Miniature Edition,"The book information is good, but be sure to notice that you are ordering a MINIATURE book. It is about 3"" x 3""."
2,Rancid comes back and rocks the world.,"Rancid's new album Life Won't Wait is full of great new songs. They have one of the best punk sounds today and this album is the perfect example. Songs such as ""bloodclot"" and ""new dress"" are getting heavy airplay. Every song on the album rocks and you won't be disapointed. And of course you gota love the mohawks."
2,gteat product,worked great right out the box. love the touch screen.the voice commands are on time and clear.if you miss a turn it recalculates quickly.the only down side was that it does not come with a usb cable or wall charger.
2,A Good Analysis,"This book offers a thought provoking look at Europe and how its being overtaken by radical islam, loosing its prosperity, its heritage, and becoming a violent dangerous place with a visceral hatred of America.Why is this happening? Europe has failed to learn from the past.Europeans have devalued life and stopped believing in themselves and their culture as unique and deserving to be preserved.This book is important because as the title implies what happens to them will effect us as well."
1,Would Have Rated it Zero Stars if I Could,"One of the stupidest and nonsensical ""documentaries"" that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The DVD espouses typical anti-Catholic rants and fantasies that characterize fanatical fundamentalist hallucinations and unrealities.This is 66 minutes of my life wasted watching this nonsense..."
2,WELL DONE,Worth seeing. Don't know how the lead character in this survived so many traumatic incidents and still lived for many more years.
2,"Great for dogs, great for you","My lab/spaniel mix hates this-- but she doesn't like rawhide at all, so we gave it to my mom's shih-tzu and she loves it-- best part is, it makes her breath smell like syrup when she's done"
2,"Ignor the ""philosophizing""","I'm a long time Gabriel fan. But before purchasing this title I read a bunch of reviews to get an idea of what to expect. There's an awful lot of ""philosophizing"" about you have to listen to this CD half a dozen times before you get it. After that, you'll love it. Based on some reader comments and listening to the samples, I was expecting a bizzar and interesting new Gabriel album--but tough to listen to. Well, the first listening for me was fantastic and not abstract nor strange at all. If you enjoy any of Gabriel's albums, you'll love this one just as much--at least I did."
1,Decent Album DRM copy protection.,"I just bought this album and it has some great sampling and licks. It has a terrific variance of sounds with great layering. You can tell they had a lot of fun making this album.However, it is DRM encoded, so you cannot copy it to your MP3 player to listen to while you run, or your car's MP3 player to listen to while you drive. Fair use!? Evidently, its not their concern. All I know is (...) the record label is going to tell me how and where to listen to it!? I can understand Lars pulling crap like this, but Mike D!? Free Tibet!? How about FREE MY MUSIC!!!"
1,foolish,i order the product november 18 and received it december 16 after understanding how to use the machine i notice coffegrinds going in the wrong place i follow instruction to allign machine but still didnt solve problem call de longhi directly and follow instruction again but grinds are still all over the place after 2 and half week amazon.com try to contact seller but ad no response i just wish to send this piece of .... back were it belong...
2,THE QUIET MAN,IT TOOK A WHILE TO FINALLY RECEIVE THE DVD BUT WORTH THE WAIT. SOME PROBLEM WITH THE SHIPPING BUT THE COMPANIES DID EVERYTHING POBBIBLE TO DELIVER. I WON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT DOING THIS AGAIN.
1,Don't bother,"This coffee maker was very poorly constructed. It arrived with two pieces broken off and the unit did not close properly. I was so disappointed, but amazon's return procedures made things easy. Don't bother ordering this machine, you'll be disappointed. Buy a cuisinart!!!"
1,Maybe it was just the one I got....,Had issues collapsing the ramp and in general lots of trouble using it. My son still liked to play with it but every time he would try to close it it would sound like it was breaking. The button underneath was useless. Also I threw away all the cones because of choking hazard for younger brother.
1,regretting it,"Hi,I am highly regretting buying this mat.It is too bulky to carry.And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon."
1,"beware, its not a novel","this book came up as suggested reading after I had read William Fortschen's One Second After, so because I liked that, I gave this a try. Should've saved my money...First of all, there really isnt any story, the characters are so weak, so you cant call this a novel. Its so didactic, there isnt any build up of tension or excitement that would lead me to want to prepare for something, all it does is put me to sleep. The whole thing reads like : Oh, Jesus likes Swiss knives for skinning because they are the sharpest, and Joseph carries a revolver because that can easily be concealed, and Mary can transfuse blood and sew stitches in wounds"" and proceeds to tell you in several excruciating pages how she does it. Its just how it read to me, I had to put it down , couldnt finish it at allIf I wanted an instructional book on survival, I would have bought one. I wanted a novel that actually told a story"
2,Hawaii Five-0 -- Worth the Wait!,Video Quality of Transfer is great. Can't wait for season 2 and beyond.
1,Did not work,"This is a waste of money, still went overdue and had to be induced. Tastes like chocolate syrup. Don't buy unless you are bored and have lots of cash."
2,This album rocks!!!!!!!,"This album is awesome. Sully's vocals are a lot stronger than before. The guitars and drums sound heavier than before. I liked how the CD came with an enhanced portion which had a little menu that had the songs and when you click on them it gives the lyrics, picture, and a video clip of them talking about the album. Each song has its own clip. I just wish that it would have included the music video ""Awake"" in the enhanced portion, but the CD is still cool though."
2,MECHANICAL TRIBAL,"VERY HYPNOTIC, ''ADJUST ME'' IS A LITTLE DISJOINTED,STUTTER, THAT INVIGORATES AND MAYBE WE ARE THE MACHINES AND WE NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.BUT THIS IS A WONDERFUL LISTENING EXPERIENCE THE AUDIO GENERATORS HUM OSCILATORS SOOTHE TOO, LIKE HAPPY BEAMMING STAR CRYSTALS. METAL MADE SHIMMERING.LIKE A GOOD SHEPPARD, STONED ASLEEP AND DREAMING.."
1,Not accurate,My kitchen-Aid oven and this thermometer differ by 50 degrees at 400. I have another oven thermometer which is much closer to the temperature of my oven. I've been cooking long enough to know the thermometer is wrong by a lot.
2,"works great, just kinda large","The software is easy to use, will help even a novice set up a sprinkler system to get the most use of your water. It's nice to be able to ajust for varying conditions without reprogramming. Two drawbacks: It's black and bulky. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but I've had my old timer on the wall on my back porch for years, this one will have to find a new location. The other problem is the way the USB programming module plugs in, I think it's going to be require a large outdoor enclosure, in order to be able to plug it in."
1,This Game is Horrible,"If you are looking for a cheep but okay DS racing game, stay away from this game. For anyone, buying this game is practically burning money. It's that bad. It is probably the easiest game I've bought."
1,Almost Famous,"I wasn't shocked when I heard this album by Lumidee. Everything on the album is great except for the person singing. I honestly feel that she has no vocal talent what so ever. I would have been happy with just the instumental version. I think she needs some singing lessons. Other than her terrible voice, I think the album was great. Sounds like another one hit wonder!!"
2,Still the best and even more user friendly.,"Due to the fact that virus notifications come like clockwork these days, the update to 2003 felt like a good idea to us. I do like the updated graphic user interface features as well as the IM scans. Something which my wife and I use everyday (work and personal).If this is your first year with Norton, you'll take a price hit, but next year it'll be cheaper (save your receipt). If you already have one then you know that this purchase is already a great saving! Don't miss this, the money spent now will save you a HUGE headache later. Take it from someone who's been through this!"
2,My thoughts of Oedipus,"I actually liked the book/video Oedipus; it had a lot of weird and twisted ideas and situations. I wont say that it was the best book in the world but it kept my attention through out the story. One thing I can't understand is why someone would have a thought in there head to write about incest the way that this book had but once again I'm not saying that this is a ""Bad Book"". I would recommend it to English classes for a reading assignment as like my class did. So over all I guess I had fun reading this book and wouldn't mind picking it up again to get the story in my head"
1,A Boring list of common places,"Page after page, motivational phrases and cites with no structure or development of any kind.Boring, a waste of $$$ and time."
2,tori hits with her best shot,"Tori Amos continues her brilliant lyrical and writing brillinace with ""Bliss"". The song is solid, quite lovely, works well with live performances as well. While it does not top ""Crucify"", ""Jackie's Strength"", or ""God"", its a fine change of pace from the Ricky Martin/Britney Spears radio opputunities.Hope the rest of ""Venus"" is as charming as ""Bliss""."
1,"Useless, terrible service from Panasonic","The phone makes in intermitent clicking noise, as if someone has picked up another line. While talking on the handset, all of a sudden you can hear an echoe and can barely hear the person you're talking to. I took it back to Panasonic for repair, they replaced the PCI board, but the phone is still doing the same thing. I took it back again, and they said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm very disappointed with Panasonic. I've had 2 Panasonic 900 MHZ phone and they are fine. This one is useless. Panasonic quality and service has gone downhill. The 30 day refund period has ended and I'll be stuck with a useless phone. I'll have to spend more to buy another working phone."
2,Finally and Unfortunatly Final,"This was well worth the wait. I've always been a big fan of live recordings and have been waiting patiently for Megadeth to release a live CD.I've seen Megadeth live and they have done an excellant job of capturing the sound as it would be at a show. Then there are the tracks chosen, couldn't be better, the best of the best.With Megadeth's recently announced disbandment, this CD was a must, and I must add an excellant way to go out. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed."
1,This isn't your traditional Peanuts special,"Each year, we anxiously await the airing of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". That's one of our holiday highlights. Last year, we were curious about the new ""I Want a Dog for Christmas"" and tried to sit through it. We made it about halfway through, and couldn't stand to watch the rest. Rerun getting sent to the office for sexual harassment?? C'mon, give me a break. It's too bad that the writers of the new piece felt that they had to slide in such a PC agenda. Just watch the original instead."
2,An awesome book,I recommend this to the John Wash 5th grade class of 2013 CAIt's a really good book; you'll love it
2,You can't go wrong with this....,"There is something about Amelia Bedelia that captures the attention of children, my 7 year old son can't get enough of her. If you want your child to discover the joys of laughter and fun in a book then you have to buy this!"
2,A Great Movie that Eerily Foreshadows the events of 9/11/01,"A couple of weeks ago I was at my local video store and saw this movie on the shelf and decided to rent it. This is a very good movie told in very good detail! I learned a lot about the first attack that I never knew and was very shocked at the ending when Ramsi Yusef told the FBI agent escorting him back to NYC for his trial that this basically was not over yet. That really shook me up!... My bottom line is that this a true story movie told in very true to life detail. If you are curious about the first bombing and the events leading up to it, I highly recommend this movie!"
2,"Great contents, not so great packaging","Length:: 1:26 MinsDespite hailing from Oregon, Black `n Blue was a pretty active player in the L.A. metal scene. They released four studio albums from 1984-88, but for whatever reason never quite found the success that their peers in Ratt and Motley Crue achieved. Musically the band had a sound that was equal parts Ratt and King Kobra. It was definitely L.A. hair metal, but instead of being overly sleazy it had an AOR polish.In 2005, Majestic Records reissued all four Black `n Blue studio albums with digitally remastered sound. They also released a limited edition box set that included all four albums as well as a bonus DVD. As you can see, the packaging leaves something to be desired, but for those who missed the Black `n Blue albums the first time around or want to get all four remasters in one shot, it's a pretty good deal."
1,Vomit Inducing!!,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!! I can't think of any other words to describe this disgrace of an album! From start to finish, this is truly horrendous! If you think it's a good album, you truly need to consult a psychiatrist and get a hearing check! Avoid this any way you can, it's AWFUL! The worst album I've ever listened to in my entire life, bar none!!!"
2,Not bad,"I also thought the story ended rather abruptly, almost noir-like. The ending, while cute, wasn't as satisfying as I was beginning to anticipate, thus a 4 star rating. Otherwise, the film does build interest as it goes, smouldering in the beginning but aquiring clarity and sense of direction as it continues - only to break off suddenly as you find your interest engaged. Either way, it is still a good, if short film at 92 minutes, with a subtle sense of humour and a recognizable cast who put in fine understated performances."
1,"I like it, but it's missing alot of pieces","Yes, in the future you can look like Madonna or Elvis. But why would you step on a subway train with five Elvis' sitting around? How do people tell each other apart? And would you want to look like Elvis if thousands of people already do? These are some of the obvious questions this book overlooks. There's more. The picture of the future is interesting, but foolishly described. The flow of the book is sporadic and I get the feeling the author isn't well versed in biology or genetics to give compelling details of the books creations. I would suspect Junior High boys would love this story. Much of it made me think of storylines explored in the Ninja Turtles cartoons! Cowabunga, Mr. Young!"
1,"not useful for ""coders""","The book has useful information but it is ""user"" unfriendly from a ""medical coders"" point of view. It does not address the whole: ""prefix or suffix"" issues and is hard to use"
1,Save yourself while you can...,"The esteemed reviewer that wrote the review titled ""Danger, Danger, Danger"" has summed it up very well. The first few books are very good... then not so much. Add to that the fact that there are 11 (yes, 11) of these tomes released to date, and the story line is still in a complex shambles with little sign of ending, and you have a sad continuation of a series that started with excellent potential.And another thing (pet peeve time) what is up with the cover art on these books?!? Could they possibly have picked worse artwork? It's horrible... HORRIBLE...Anyway, I gave this book 2 stars, +4 for the first few books, -2 for the rest. Start this series knowing that the first 4 or so books are very good, then you should move on and read Wiki for the plot summaries on the rest. You'll save yourself weeks of wasted time to read more worthy books."
2,Good Pocket Performer,Bought two peds...one for me and one for spouse. Easy to set up and use. Place in pocket in any position and it seems to record steps without difficulty. So far so good.
2,Great deal! Fast Shipping! Love the cable!,"I am currently using this Monster Cable for Blu Ray movies on my Playstation 3 and the picture quality difference is big over my standard HDMI cable. I do not recommend spending a large chunk of money for it ($80+), but for $20-40 it is worth it. Great buy! Thank you. P.S. If you are using this on a Motorola DVR box recent model it does not fit in all the way properly (unless I just did not push it in all the way, but I did not want to force it). Playstation 3 works great though."
2,worth it,"I've used several of these now, on several different bikes. They seem to do a pretty good job of keeping stickers out of my mountain bike tires... though a goathead recently went thru one of them. Only negative I'd give is that they don't cover any of the sidewalls, so if you get a puncture on the side, they're worthless. I've now gone to slime tubes, and so far, so good."
1,"All hype, no substance","I should have read the other negative reviews before buying this book. The Passion Test is nothing more than making a list of 10 things you like and then whittling it down. No insight, no creativity, no help.The authors have been active in the self-help world for some time and have peddled all sorts of pap, anything to make a buck. They are part of a group that promotes each others' products through cross marketing and reviewing each others' products, so I'd take the raves for this book with a large grain of salt.One thing is clear: The author's passion is marketing pap to the pseudo-spiritual seekers. Save your money."
1,too small.,The picture is very misleading. The items are much smaller that the picture leads you to believe. I do like the earrings but I believe the price is too high for the quality of the item.
1,Awful,Shambles of an erotic thriller the sex scenes are virtually non existent and the story line is terrible i was very dissapointed with my purchase and encourage all to avoid this film.
2,Best i've found so far,"Am the proud owner of a 2008 F-150 Limited. The white rims on it really get to be a mess from brake dust. This really works!!! Yes, it is expensive to use, however, it is the only product that even comes close to its ""claims"" for ease of cleaning."
2,Is there anything he can't play?,"According to the liner notes, Frankie Gavin even plays the accordion on this CD! His talent is truly awe-inspiring; I think he could make a kazoo sound symphonic. Mostly flute music, with fiddle and penny-whistle, Gavin's incredible skills are on fine display on this CD. I recommend this without reservation."
2,hole punch,arrived promptly good quality im glad I made the purchase. Just what I wanted and great quality; thanks to Charles Leonard arrived to time and was able to be used straight away.
2,Great for practice & play!,"I purchased these nets for my two sons to play soccer at home. They are like magnets, we set them up and last night we had 8 extra kids in the backyard playing a game of soccer! They appear to be very durable and are easy to set up and put away. Very happy with the purchase so far and would purchase again."
2,WHAT THE HELL!?,"What am I missing here? This is an incredible album, even without the bonus tracks that make it beyond incredible. I think some SRV ""fans"" resent him making an album that has cross-over appeal. Hell, I would say ""Change It,"" ""Lookin' Out the Window,"" ""Look At Little Sister,"" and ""Say What"" are as good a songs as SRV ever did. But there are a lot more great songs as well. And he does throw a bone to the blues/jazz crowd with the songs ""Gone Home"" and ""Empty Arms."" Of course the two Hendrix bonus tracks will blow you away. I will repeat what someone else has already said, Stevie played Jimi better than Jimi played Jimi. To people getting into SRV, trust me, this is a great album."
2,Passion for Truth,"Andrew Harvey has given us a passionate, loving homage to Rumi, as well as a reliable depiction of the mystical path, with its dangers and joys. Harvey is no mere `academic'; he is an enthusiastic lover of Truth. In an age when Rumi's poems are available widely, this audiobook is a powerful reminder that there is a teaching/learning depth in Rumi that his mere popularity can't possibly reflect. (Ridhwan students, especially: read or hear this book!)"
1,Very biased and onesided look.,"If you don't belong to Polish nationality you would not get from this book something that Polish nationalists would. That is feelings of their own righteousness and innocence and depicting of their enemy as brutal savages.All you'll get is one sided and very biased view of a person who wants to make all people believe in his fairy tale, or his distorted world view. There are some comments that provide a story of Ukrainian-Polish relationships, so I will not tell it again.The only thing to remember is that Polish people were murdering Ukrainians with great brutality, and Ukrainians were acting equally toward them too. It was a foolish and sad period of reciprocal bloodshed, not a genocide of one nation by other."
2,Large drainer stops the fustration!,"Excellant large - perfect for 4 adult household. I said scratch to the dishwasher and am washing by hand, everyone has to do their own dishes - fabulous!"
2,Confusion over Quality,"I've read quite a few of the comments about this DVD and the quality of the Picture. I feel that people are missing a glaring point. This disc was recorded in the UK. The UK uses an entirely different format for recording and broadcasting TV. They use the PAL format. In the US, where many are playing this, we use the NTSC format. In the transfer from one format to the other, much picture quality is lost. Be reminded of all those old British comedies that you can watch on PBS stations. The quality is not as sharp...due to the Transfer process. The other issue it that it was recorded in 1995. Go watch some 'old' football films/games from 1995, and you'll see the quality has improved much since then. People have also complained about Dolby sound quality. Again, it's the 1995 recording."
2,What can I say?,"This is classic Kirby. No one else creates mythology like he does. His New Gods / Fourth World books were some of the best comics ever done -- a nice blending of world mythologies with the American comic-book mythos. Mr. Miracle is his Heracles, Horace, Heru, etc., and is just as entertaining today as it was when it was first written. The black and white art may put off some potential readers, but Kirby's art sans the color really brings out the weight and depth of his lines."
1,Everything Is Pretentious,"What an overrated, pretentious and annoying author. This book started off pretty entertaining, then became unbearable by the time Safran Foer employed his 5,000th literary technique to show off how smart he is. Whoopdeedoo! You're smart! Guess what? Who cares? Well, a lot of people do apparently, but that's only because he wrote about the holocaust. Now, the nerve of this guy, his next book revolves around 9-11. What a revolting way to sell books. And his article in Playboy? The guy wrote an article about blank pieces of paper. He really is atrocious."
2,A great conspiracy story rivaling live police dramas,"Unless you're Rainman, you'll be watching (and definitely enjoying) this movie over and again to get all the characters, events, and plot straight. And even when you've figured it out and memorized every line, it's still a great adventure. I saw this movie recommended on a thoroughly-criticized ""Top 10 Anime to Watch Before You Die"" list and this movie rests there most deservedly. Just get it already."
1,Will not stay in place.,Installed the rain guard and the guard would not stay in place. Bowed the rubber seal the window sits in so the window would not raise as easy. Going to buy the ones that stick to the outside of the door.
2,Awesome,"Awesome harness. SUPER cute design (got the cherry blossom one) that makes my wild kitty look stylish and pet-like. It takes a little work to put it on the first time but I gave her tons of bonito flake treats and she doesn't resist at all when I clip it around her because she looks forward to those. She also doesn't pay attention to it or seem bothered by it all when it's on, so it must be pretty comfortable.I haven't walked her too many times on it yet but it seems to hold in place pretty well. It never seemed like she could get out of it.My only complaint is that due to the weight of the clips, it shifts to one side and then sits on her crookedly, even with the harness adjusted pretty tightly. But that's not even a huge deal as she doesn't care."
1,bad order,i order a new 14 speed oster blender from literrallyamazing an they sent me a use on unto now i cant get back one because i mention i am from the caribbean that make the seller happy i am not there to get ma claim i couldn't use that old thing with plenty marksi will not order no used item
1,Allergy,I don't know if this product is a fake or not. But everytime my husband uses it he develops a rash. We bought the same polo blue from Macy's earlier and it worked fine.
2,One of the greatest books in the world!,This book was one of the greatest books I've ever read. William Shatner has become my favorite author. I can not explain in words how good this book was. I would have given it 6 stars if it had been possible.
1,The best is yet to come,"[...] I don't like the A side of this CD at all. I guess I've heard the Winners version so many times now it's just not the same. The B side however I like. I have the B side in my IPOD. I would give the B side a 4 star rating but the A sides a no show for me personally. If Bo had done SHA for the A side, now that would have been awesome!. Sense I'm being honest, being that I don't like the A side I would have to give this a 2.5 star rating. I'm looking forward to his fall release because the man can sing!"
2,Clever Script and Stellar Acting,"I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to fast-forward through the video, but found myself kicking back and thoroughly enjoying ""Get the Gringo."" It's not easy (and actually risky) to attempt mixing comedy, action, and drama in a film, yet the writers (including Gibson), actors, and director pulled it off here. I agree with others that Mel is at the top of his game in this one, and his co-stars, Kevin Hernandez (as the boy) and Dolores Heredia (as the mom) shine as well. My favorite scene involves Mel...nah, I'm not going to spoil it. :)"
1,One of the sickest films ever!!!!,"Warning for all horror movie fans,this isn`t what your looking for:(I shouldnt have I rented the Item.This movie is so sick with a million cursewords and gay people and beyond gallons of blood and how about the gal having a good time the fake puppet? That scene was so low i [was sick] all night from just thinking of it! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ...!!!!"
2,Best for winter itch and dry skin,Years ago while living in Chicago I suffered from the worst winter itch of my life. A friend told me about Mantle cream and I've been using every day.
2,Some good songs here...,"CD will sound dated to many since it has an 80s flavor to it butif you like Starship, Foreigner or Survivor, you will like this CD. Kevin Chalfant's work with the STORM and TWO FIRES is betterbut this CD still warrants a listen."
2,The musical animated classic of the 80s,"it's about time Hasbro realize that people still remember thepink haired singer ot the 80s...Great songs, good characters...Aclassic."
1,Poor!,"Dark and poorly made. I understand the rational of revenge, but was tasteless and not worth watching again. Would not recommend."
1,Disappointing,"I bought the RoboMaid because I had seen a good review for it elsewhere, and figured that a low-tech toy might amuse my husband. We weren't too impressed. The replacement pads get filled quite easily, and anything remotely solid that the RoboMaid comes across only gets pushed around (and sometimes is re-deposited under sofas, chairs, cabinets or in the corner).It's a cute little gadget but my husband went and bought a more high-tech robotic vacuum a few days later."
2,Brings back good ol' memories of Texas and Oklahoma!,"As an old Okie who grew up in the '50s listening to the Texas/Oklahoma variety of western swing music, Hank Thompson always stood out as the best ever. His band was always top notch, tight and tasteful, with a sound that made people want to dance. Hank's singing, with that warm sincere voice, always pleased the ear. On this new CD he sounds exactly the same, if not better, and the band is great. His unique songs like ""Green Light"" and ""I'll Still be Here Tomorrow"" show his mix of humor and simple sincerity, with musical taste."
1,Do touch this product!,"I spent over two weeks trying to get this software to work and every error including the 'blue screen of death' was a known problem by Symantec. Their solution was uninstall, reinstall over and over. Each time new errors and again all known by Symantec.This product is not ready for release and unless you want to Beta test for Symantec, don't go near it.No stars for this product."
2,This bar is excellent! It's like eating a ...,This bar is excellent! It's like eating a peanut butter brownie with chocolate frosting -- and it helps you lose weight. I've tried other bars and drinks and they didn't have the good taste that this one does. I would highly recommend it!
1,Most Useless Product I Have Ever Ordered,"I can't even begin to tell you how useless this product is. It feel like it was made by a child. It doesn't release tension but rather only causes it. I have read the ""manual"" which is actually a 4 page book with crappy pictures and I have also read different methods on the internet. In the end, I wish I had never purchased this trash. It pretty much hangs as a prop in my closet."
1,Ridiculous,"This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from. Fossils exists don't they? So there's proof of my alien theory. It makes just as much sense as ""intelligent design"". Hey, the aliens were the ""intelligent designers"". That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too."
2,"Wonderful, exciting group.","What a group! Being a drummer, I bought it mainly because of Dave Weckl. but everyone is magnificent. Dave has matured into one of the greatest drummers of all time. Visual effects, lighting and sound are all great. I never tire of playing it. Highly recommended."
2,I love godsmack!,Godsmack is the coolest! i saw them live in concert and they rocked! personally i think they're the next MetallicA!
2,Pretty good for a summer read,"This is a book about pirates, their lives, their conquests, their brotherhood and their deaths. It's not a historically precise piece, and it's not going to win a Nobel prize for fine literature. All that aside its a great book to read when you want a pirate book that's less fluff and more adult than a Disney's adaption. It's well written, has a good plot, interesting characters and is unpredictable enough to keep you interested till the end. Don't forget to have some of the Capt. Morgan around to set the mood."
2,This movie is a must See !,"I though this viedo waz very well done... i got 2 c inside the label i really like ... The pieces of some of the viedos i didn't ever see before were a big plus... I really got to see inside some of my favorite singers ... Like 2pac ( 1 of the greatest rappers to ever sing .. if not the best), Suge Knight (AkA the CEO of Death Row Record) and Nate Dogg , To name a few ... i feel that anyone who likes rap or most of all the WEST COAST ! should see this movie... i though giving out Dre'z and Snoops home address was a little out of hand ... but i got to say it was a Great way to end the movie ! Well thats my Review .. Peace"
2,Complete Coverage,"The book is complete in its coverage of everything horse related. The section on saddles, parts of the saddles and bridles was very good. The sections on horse racing statistics, harness racing stats was a bit too much for me."
2,Wonderful! Inexpensive.,"I grew tired of the stainless steel gas grill with its unavailable or pricey replacement parts, complicated design that is hard to clean, and wanted to go back to charcoal. I found this grill on sale for about 95 bucks and it is worth every penny. It looks great and has the weight and quality build that should be expected from this type of old school barrel grill. The grill surface is huge so feel free to cook for an army! The real plus is the simplicity of the design and construction. Parts are easy to replace but that probably won't be necessary. A lot of bang for the buck. I found the ash receptacle very easy to clean. It might be awkward for grandma to move around but this is no behemoth that is frightful to negotiate. My grill was already assembled so I cannot speak to the assembly complications of the other reviewer, that said, the design is so simple that I find it hard to believe that it could difficult to do. Enjoy!"
2,Excellent book,The book challenges practically everything I thought I knew about pre-conquest native american culture. A fascinating read covering both the remarkable societies and landscape before 1491 and the crushing tragedy which follows it.
1,crotch strap is way too short,My son is 19 month old and 29 lb. We could barely buckle him in because the crotch strap is way too short and not adjustable. The manual claims the limit is 37 lb and 43 inches. I would like to see such a baby sitting in this stroller. We returned it immediately.
2,I love this book,"I must say this is one of my favorite ""instruction"" books. Although it was so interesting to read, that I would read it at leisure. I really like how its designed, and how well the author illustrated various points.I found it very useful for a variety of design media, easy to follow, engaging, and it smells kind of nice. I don't know if yours will come with that nice new book smell (and a hint of fresh plastic), but mine still has this awesome book scent a few years after I bought it.I'm buying a second for my web designing friend."
1,Too much of a good thing,"I was quite dissapointed in this book, particularly given the hype and the other reviews. While the introduction was well done, I thought a surprising number of the recipes were mayonnaise-based, and that the portions were all over the place. In one recipe, two -2lb pork tenderloins (no waste) feed four people (pg. 144) as does 2 lbs. of ground beef (again no waste; pg. 156) yet in another, two 1 lb. bone-in T-bone steaks feed six people (lots of waste). That seems off. What also seems off are the calories. I noticed that on several of the recipes, by the time you end up figuring in calories for fat and various other caloric ingredients (e.g. avocado, cheese, nuts), you're close to the nutritional analysis calories before you even add the meat (e.g. pgs. 166/67 & 130/31).I guess it's just not my thing!"
1,Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Ruined,"I broke down last year and entered the world of MMOG with Star Wars. I swore I would never pay monthly to play a game. But SWG changed all that. It needed a bit more content, and some balancing but the overal system was good. Then comes the much awaited combat upgrade, promising to fix those little problems within the game. Unfortunatly the upgrade was pushed out the door before it had been thoroughly tested and was released to the live servers. Many things don't work. Grouping to gain experiance is now forced if you want to gain levels, and unfortunatly not many are grouping so you will spend 2 hours just trying to find 1 or 2 players that will join you. Everybody just stands around now. It is so boring and sadening that they have done this to try and capitalize on the upcomming movie. Stay Away until they fix these problems"
2,Best of Zappa's Guitar Work.,"What I like is the range of bizarre guitar sounds on the record and Frank's use of the guitar as a melodic instrument, like a jazz saxophone, instead of just a ""rock out"" guitar solo that is part of a regular song. The variety of guitar tones he gets are pretty amazing and fun to listen to.He has this crazy natural abillity that is present in his solos. Every once in a while during a solo, he will hit the most beautiful note that you never even thought he could throw in, but he does it and i am amazed every time.The title track is cool, so is Five-Five-Five, and I believe Steve Vai had some part in this record. I only have the tape, it's a 20 year old cassette. Treacherous Cretins is pretty cool too. A classic."
1,Irritated with Vendor,"Order was placed on 12/27/12 from ""Midnight Merchant"", but did not ship from the vendor until 12/31/12.Initiated a return request on 1/28/13 but was denied. I felt that the 30 day guarantee should apply from ship date and not the date of my order."
1,I'm amazed,in a negative way..he let me realised there can actually be such a talentless chap to create a album..yucks! go away!
2,Maravilhoso,Eu gosto de todas as musicas do Dwight.tenho quase todos os CDs e DVD.Os que no encontro aquir no BrasilAquir eu encontro.Fiquei muito feliz quando descubrirO Amazon.com pois aquir eu posso conprar todos os DVS e CDS do Dwight.Conprei semana passada 3 CDS e 1 DVD.Estou anciosa para uma chegada dos meus cds.Pois fico ouvindo o Dwight TODOS OS DIAS.Ele e maravilhoso.Eu Amo suas musicas.I love you Dwight Yoakam.Maria (Netttinha)
1,"Too loud, side edges need padding, battery replacement not easy",Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
2,great puzzle,I bought the puzzle for my autistic nephew and he likes it as much as his other favorites.
2,No more wet clothes!,"Love giving my kids juice boxes when we're out and about - don't love them squeezing the juice all over themselves and their car seat. This totally did the trick and saved the day. I have 4 of them and keep them everywhere, just in case. They make it way easier for little hands to enjoy their drink. I'm not sure what someone was complaining about with them chipping, etc. I've had mine for ages and throw them in the dishwasher and they don't have a mark. Don't throw it off a cliff and it should be fine! For $2 you can't beat it!"
2,Excellent guide,"Great guide, provides plentiful information about graduate programs in engineering. Convenient because it is broken up into engineering disciplines, so you don't need to sort through to find the programs that support your major/interest. Also, WAY cheaper than the newer versions but contains essentially the same information."
1,"Monkeys have emotions, too (but better options exist for you)","Out of a dozen ""feelings"" in the book, almost half are negative (scared, hurt, sick, sad, naughty), plus the presumption that your youngster needs to sulk in time outs.This very short board book, published in 1998, simply takes scenes from existing Curious George books. This then is a money grab, and offers little at that.For a child who has trouble handling emotions, better options exist. For the baby demographic,Disney's Winnie the Pooh: Feelings (Learn & Grow)is a great choice. Older kids can try eitherToday I Feel Silly: And Other Moods That Make My Dayby Jamie Lee Curtis orBig Rabbit's Bad Moodby Romanian author (not the model?) Ramona Badescu."
2,dopest grouch cd ever,"This is the best grouch cd ever released in 96 it was the first underground Hip Hop i've ever heard and the best. it really opened my mind. if it wasn't 4 grouch i dont know what I would be listening to now, much love and respect. the march is one of my favorite tracks so is grouch's prayer that's just my favorites but all the songs are tight not one dissapointing track on this cd if anyone tells you it's wack they must not know what real Hip-hop is. much love grouch!!! show em what west coast HipHop is all about."
2,Helpful Little Book,"Respected pastor-theologian, John Piper, referred to this book. A very high view of marriage is put forth and defended. Worthwhile reading."
1,"Long, Boring but beautiful","So to sum this up as short as I can. This is a Beautiful game with lackluster story, annoying characters, and bad voice overs. There was a point in this game where every 10 min of game play there was a 3 min video that accomplished nothing. I saw a preview the other day for this game and their big line is ""The battle within begins"". I agree with that line completely. I battled with myself for days trying to find the desire to finish this game. I would not recommend this game to the majority of gamers. Stay away and wait for something worth while."
1,This Book is not Helpful to the Average Tourist,"The author seems to know what she is talking about in Rome which is the lagest part of the book. Her recommendations in Florence and Venice seem to be based mostly on hearsay.Consider this: The book is 274 pages long. The glossary of terms and bibliograpy account for 72 pages. The book does review trattorias but it also reviews expensive restaurants, pizzerias,gelaterias, wine bars , shops that sell wine and serve light lunches, and wine shops that offer tastings and canapes. There is a lot of detail im this book, but after reading it I decided it was of little practical use to me since I am an ordinary tourist looking for a good place to eat near the attractions I will be visiting on this my third trip to Rome (second to Florence and Venice). Many of the recommendations are clustered in neighborhoods that are somewhat removed. The book is not going on my trip with me... The purchase price was a waste of money."
2,Great dance track,"It's very similar to Alexia's ""The Summer Is Crazy"" but it's still a good dance track with an easy and catchy chorus. Playahitty is known for her catchy dance tracks and this one is no exception. Definetly worth checking out if you are into dance music."
1,Bedtime Reading,"This book is a horrible read. There are some good ideas, but they are hidden by all the charts and results. This was mandatory for Professional Development, or I would have stopped in the first chapter."
1,Not a good read!,"Don't get me wrong, i'm an avid bsc fan! but what i don't like is how it seems like the kids in the books are being forced to grow up so fast. I mean, the triplets one minute are big brats and the next are sitting for 10 year olds? Yeah, right!"
1,Not as described.,The product description and photo show a three piece rod set. You only actually get one rod with handle. Returned.
2,Elisha Hunt Rhodes was there...and everywhere!,Elisha Hunt Rhodes was in so many major battles it is astonishing to comtemplate how he managed to survive the war. Except for the small font that my old eyes have trouble seeing adequately the book was a great read and almost like talking with an aging veteran on the front porch of his house.
2,"TigerLily, Natalie Merchant","Wow, did this ever take me back to my hippie days. Wonderful music!! I'm 66, well almost 67 this month and I loved this music. It's timeless!!"
2,Super hero costumes,My 3 year old LOVES these costumes. The capes are a little long for him yet but not to the point that he will trip on them. He loves the fact that he can choose who he's going to be each day. This was a great investment for our family.
1,not water assistance,"in frist time when I washed my hand the water entered the glass . then I contacted the amazon customer service . I returned and they sent me another watch , but same problem . the water became inside the watch , and now it doesn't work at all .I will not returned and I will not buy it any more ."
2,THE BEST CD/DVD I'VE EVER OWNED.,"I'VE LISTENED TO THIS CD EVERYDAY SINCE I'VE OWNED IT. ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE A DVD PLAYER YET, I TAKE IT WHEREVER I GO JUST IN CASE SOMEONE HAPPENS TO HAVE ONE. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST AALIYAH CD I HAVE (AND I HAVE THEM ALL). HER DEATH WAS UNTIMELY BUT SHE WILL FOREVER LIVE ON IN MY HEART."
1,Expensive!!!,"This manual is comprehensive, but you pay the price. If you're looking to get into the mystery shopping business, start as a mystery shopper first quickly, then decide if you want to do this."
2,best game in history,"i would give this millions of stars. This is a great game. The voiceovers are awesome, the graphics are incredible, the control is good, and the fun factor is awesome. there are hundreds of disney characters. The worlds are wonderland,olypus colisium,deep jungle, agrabah, monstro, atlantica, halloween town, neverland, and hundred acre wood. I beat this game and i wish i can do it again without knowing the real story. I deafeated the great warrior Sephiroth, the ice titan and other hidden bosses. I did all of the extra things like finding all dalmations, winning hades cup, and sealing every world. I also got the ultima weapon. To all you final fantasy fans you might like this without the disney characters, I thought this game was dumb but when I played it I lived it, anyone who hates this game does not know what a masterpiece is. I proudly have this game on my rack of games. Everyone get this game and make it become a greatist hit."
2,depends on your taste in books,We've bought this trilogy from our 12 y/o son's Christmas wish list. He is Harry Potter fan and LOVED these books. He rereading it over and over and still finds the stories entertaining. As far as a parent's concern - great buy!
1,Meh,Not my kind of heroine. I skipped paragraphs on occasion to keep my eyes from rolling too much. I was not impressed with the Dirk and Steele organization either.
2,Very Good Read!,I ordered this book because of the reviews and I was not disappointed. If you are interested in nursing or currently in the field it is a very good read. The relationships between Doctors and Nurses has always interested me and this book is very direct and gives many good supporting examples. I enjoyed it very much!
2,"christmas spirit...!!!!(phoenix,az)",i downloaded the album and burned it on disc and it was played last chrismas during the party . it was nice and clear and everyone enjoyed the album .even though its a old album it still brings the joy of christmas to your home.along with other songs.a perfect edition to your collection...
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I HAVE MANY CUISINART PRODUCTS, INCLUDING 2 COMPLETE SETS OF THE CHEFS CLASSIC STAINLESS.I HAVE A MODEL 719-16NS. I'M VERY CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF HEAT USED, NEVER OVER MEDIUM HEAT.FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE MY COOKWARE. IT'S THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.THE REASON I'M GIVING THIS A 2 STAR RATING, IS BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE.ON MY PAN, THE COATING STARTED TO SEPERATE FROM THE METAL, BY THE HANDLE RIVET. UPON CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE, NOT ONLY DO YOU PAY FOR THE SHIPPING TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE UNIT, BUT YOU HAVE TO ENCLOSE A CHECK TO COVER THE RETURN SHIPPING AS WELL.TO ME, THIS IS TOTALING UNACCEPTABLE....TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING. FOR WHAT IT WILL COST ME TO PAY FOR SHIPPING BOTH WAYS, VIA USPS, I CAN ADD $15 TI IT AND BUY A NEW ONE, THAT SHIPS FREE."
1,Pretty weak tribute,"Far from the real thing... Parsons is hyped way beyond his real value anyway. Some good stuff on here, but really not worth the time or money."
1,Everything wrong,"I was sent the wrong ninja costume. Was unable to reach anyone to rectify the problem. The costume says size 8-10, but actually fits a child of about size 5-6. Not well made. Had to sew on the velco on mask and fix a hole in the seam as it is so poorly made. All around bad experience."
1,Worthless,"This router NEVER works and is always slow. I've had it for several months, and I am constantly starting and restarting it. A complete waste of money."
2,Wonderful,"I've been using this for more than a year and have found this nail and cuticle oil to be just great. Despite the other reviewer's experience, I have to tell you that for me, whenever I use it, my nails and cuticles are revived, softer, moister--just so much better in every way. I am about to get another bottle and am so relieved that it is still being sold."
2,Over-the-Door Valet,"Terrific! I have had this item for years. Then, one day it broke. I could not find a replacement anywhere. So, I came to Amazon.com and....I found this one! Thank you, Amazon.com! I love this!"
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,I live in Oregon. I bought this set and could not play the DVD. It will not play on the DVD player or on the computer and we even changed regions. I love James Blunt and have his CD (the CD in this set is great too after you get used to it being live) but I found the DVD impossible to play. I paid for something I can't even use!
2,GREAT BOOK!,"If you want to know about hockey, BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!! A GREAT forward written by the ""KING"" himself Wayne Gretzky! and Mike Meyers also wrote a great intro!!!!!"
2,Firefly,It is a crying shame that this series was canned after only one series. It is really superb viewing. The cast of characters grows on you from the start and each one has its own distinct personality. The plot of each episode is well thought out and original
1,"Not funny, just weird.","This film was just strange. The colors were visually disturbing. Mike Meyers had a bizarre accent which was a cross between the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz and Austin Powers. It grated on my nerves.Our six year old did not laugh. We had a chuckle or two. But the plot was thin and went off on tangents. Alec Baldwin was wasted in the role of the evil boyfriend.The Cat's antics were silly and the kids just stared at him woodenly.Someone obviously paid these ""stars"" a truckload of money to make this awful and disjointed and disappointing film."
1,Great hardware with the worst software on the planet,"In short, this is a great looking phone that's practically unusable. Here's the breakdown:Horrible Software- Badly organized address book. Both the contacts on the SIM and on the phone appear in the address book. If the same contact has more than one number, each appears as a separate entry in the phone book.- Lack of basic features (like a recurrent alarm, ability to clear SIM, reset address book, etc).- No separate missed calls list (they are all mixed in with the received calls). By default, there is no way to access the missed calls list from the main screen.- Turning off the phone clears SMS messages.- Unintuitive, slow user interface.- No games come with the phone.Great Hardware- Great camera.- Light, sleek, design.- Awesome reception (sometimes freakishly strong - wonder if I'm losing more brain cells because of it).So if need a phone for looks, this is the one for you. If you plan on using it, look for something else."
1,RIGHT!lol,Its oke who is this guy is he like the biggest fan ever to like Justin timberlake to be on a cd lol i mean come on hes not that good!but i think its a good idea to have tribe for Justin Hes soo awsome!such a good singer too but if i was u i rather get the REAL justin CD!~
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,What can I say? I agree with every review I have read. The worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life!!
1,Not the high-quality product that the original was,"I am very familiar with this publisher's products and have the Baby Blessings Christmas book. I was very disappointed to see that they had changed the cloth cover from the original and the book size is also smaller than the original. Now it doesn't look like it's part of a set with the Baby Blessings Christmas as the covers aren't alike and the books are not the same size! The current cover is noticeably lesser quality, very flimsy compared with the original, but more than that, it doesn't fit the book well at all. The book just slides around inside it and is on the verge of falling out. I would gladly pay the old price to have the old book. And it would be nice if the Bible book matched the Christmas one too.However, if you don't mind about the cover, or aren't familiar with the original, you probably won't have any complaints as the book itself is fine."
2,Anthem,"Anthem's language and style are the reasons for its very real narration, but I was left unsatisfied with the conclusion. Although it wasn't meant to be a book read for its plot, it left too much undone. I felt like too much was being crammed into the last two chapters, like it was just an effort to make the book end sooner."
2,"Good quality, nice fit","I found that this product runs pretty true to size. Im 6', about 200 pounds and I found that the XXL is a bit too large. I got this since other reviews said that it runs a size small, however, I've yet to wash to see how much shrinkage there will be. T-shirt definitely runs true to size, its so big I use it as a sleep shirt."
1,SO SO,when i read the first page i thought ok well it will get better as i read on but as i read on it was like ok this book is all over the place half the time i couldn't recognize which character was talking and who was who. The only part of the book that kept me reading was i think her name was cynthia and the man she met at the gym had messed her over. So i finally finsished the book out of sheer boredom and i'm not even gonna talk about the ending.
2,Possibly the best cd I've bought in a long time,"I went to go see daredevil and although the movie was terrible 2 of the songs stood out and both are on this cd. This cd is produced so immaculatly that i find myself not skipping any songs on it. I like every single song, and i don't think i can think of any other cd that does that for me. Amy's vocals on the tracks are amazing, she hits every single harmony that you've always thought, ""wow that'd be cool if the singer could hit that note"" but couldn't. She hit's that note and then goes higher, and its not a scream, its singing and beautiful. My only regret with this cd is that it isn't 5 hours long."
2,Nice lil humidifier,I enjoyed using this little humidifier for a while. It did a good job.Be warned that humidifiers will make dust allergies worse though. My doctor instructed me to stop using my humidifier for that reason.
2,Invastion - the complete series,I watched this when it was on TV. Really enjoyed watching the DVDs over and over again
2,The BIGGEST SELLING SCIENCE BOOK EVER!,This book was a New York Times best seller for years and is a must for any home library!...Just my two cents worth....It really is amazing that in today's world there are still so many millions of people who are so ignorant of Science. Read this book and you realize why religion is such a fairy tale. I like how Hawking end's the book with his comment about a CREATOR! Nice finish!
1,Way too religious,"I was looking for a book about dolphins, sharks and fish as a primer for my kids prior to our trip to Sea World. While this book has some nice photos and some interesting facts about sea life, it is also filled with religious propaganda -- which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but I wasn't and now I seriously regret the purchase. I think the description should have been much more clear about the preaching contained in the book - the single reference to ""God"" was an insufficient warning."
2,not bad at all,"Definitely helps with maneuvering the sound around the way you want to hear it, and also helps with vibration if speakers are on a desk"
2,I couldn't put it down - this is a first- rate thriller!,This sequel to The Plague Tales is as much of a good read as was its' predecessor! While I wish it had been a bit more uplifting it was true to the realities of it's times. The uncertain ending leaves things open for a third book that could perhaps follow the lives of the new members of Janie's and Alejandros' families! I look forward to another sequel. Keep up the good work.
2,Loved it...in Japanese!,"I loved it totally, but hated the English adaptation and wished it could be re-released. At least this is the full-version one now instead of the cut one. What I loved the most was the theme song because I love Minmay/Mari Iijima. I've watched this in English and Japanese... I DEFINITELY LOVE THE JAPANESE ORIGINAL WAY, WAY BETTER!!!"
2,Borchardt knows the job market,"Obviously, the job market isn't what it once was, but even when the economy recovers, the days of getting hired out of college and being set for life are gone. And yet, people still cling to that idea. John Borchardt had great insight on the field, and he was very helpful when a scientist in my family was unemployed."
2,Not for the average joe,"I think in order to understand this movie, you have to have some semblance of intelligence. It's not for your ""average joe"", blue collar, working class kind of person. But if you have what it takes to watch and get this movie, it is one awesome movie. I love movies that make you feel, make you think, and this is definitely one of those movies. Like someone else mentioned, it's not about addiction per sea. It's about hope and dreams and how easily they are lost. It's about life and how it can sneak up on you and destroy all that you thought you were. It's about how easy we can get lost and how those around us don't even see it happening until it's too late. If you want a mindless, dumb movie, don't watch this. However, if you want a movie that will make you think, make you feel; a movie that will stay with you even after you are done watching it - then this is the movie for you."
2,a Disney documentary that stands with the finest,This film documents the most difficult time in Walt Disney's life in a fair and highly entertaining way. It chronicles his and a troop of his artists voyage down south of the border and their adventures there looking for story ideas and acting as goodwill ambassadors at the behest of the U.S. government. Meanwhile back in the U.S. the studio is in turmoil trying to resolve whether Disney Studios will be a union shop or remain independent.This film shows some of the wonderful art work generated by an incredibly talent group of artists and how they are inspired by the rich and beautiful cultures of the countries they visit.
1,"John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond - how can it miss?","But it does. Vera Ralson is part of the problem, she's pretty but bland in the role of Wayne's new bride who sweet-talks him in going to the title state so they can run a riverboat business, but the real weakness is the overall look of the film. An overabundance of rear projection and rather obvious indoor/outdoor scenes gives this 'outer' a distint fake feeling. Duke is amicable in the lead, Bond makes a sturdy villian, Brennan is fine doing his Gabby Hayes impersonation and the film has a rousing climax, but it never rises beyond it's B origins"
2,I like it.,"I would give this thing 5 stars, except for one thing. The instructions. But everything else works just as advertized.They are pretty bad and hard to understand. But once you get over that, the thing just plain works. I agree that having a backup battery system would be nice so you don't have to renter stuff all the time, but then again it would only make it more expensive and be one more thing to replace.You put it in, program your numbers and it works! The other thing is I was amazed how loud the alarm is. Not sure you could hear it outside really, but it is ear piercing if you are inside! Definitely would send me running if I was an intruder. I had to go to silent mode after the test run, it was just too loud.If it lasts a couple of years then definitely the best money I ever spent."
2,Its Funny,"I read this book in my second grade class. This is a funny book. Even Steven likes everything even. Odd Todd likes everything odd. For example, Even Steven would like 8 pancakes and Odd Todd would like 7 pancakes. Even Steven goes through hard work with Odd Todd. Then, Even Steven notices that odd and even are both good. My favorite part was when Odd Todd and Even Steven win their $50 prize."
1,Gotta Make That Payment on the Ferrari,"I give this book two stars because it is at least mildly entertaining. You read The Firm and then you read The Summons and you realize that John Grisham has either shot his creative wad or he's become too greedy and lazy to write at the level he achieved with The Firm...in The Summons Grisham starts off with a compelling idea but then seems to lack the will to develop that idea to its full potential. After a great start, The Summons turns into predictable, cliche-ridden boilerplate. It feels like a story that was ginned out in a hurry to meet a contract deadline..."
1,WHAT!? NO NATIVE AMERICAN ART?,"Was looking up 'Native American Art', and this came up! What is Amazon thinking! ! It may be out there, but I was not thinking about this kind of 'ART'!"
1,A Wretched Piece of Garbage,"This album is bad. I don't mean ""Hot in the Shade"" bad. It's actually embarassing to listen to. With the exception of ""Naked City"" and maybe ""She's So European"", the songs range from unlistenable to embarassing to unbearable. What made it worse when it came out was that Kiss had previously released ""Dynasty"", which was a bit weak, and then they released this in the midst of the New Wave revolution and it looked like this was going to be it for the boys. Awful, awful, awful album. Give your money to the poor before spending it on ""Unmasked""."
2,Help for Struggling Spanish Students!,"As a college level spanish student I am constantly searcing my textbooks and dictionaries for the proper conjugations of various spanish verbs. With this book I am finally able to find any verb I need- quickly. It is organized in a very easy to follow manner, and with its relatively small size its easy to take to class or wherever you have to go!"
1,poor organization makes it hard to find doable observations,"The first problem with this book is that for the urban or suburban observer with less than giant binoculars, it is too hard to find objects that you will really have any luck with. You have to sort through long lists of 9th-magnitude star clusters to find anything that would really be visible. The second problem is that a large percentage of the objects listed are pretty dim and crummy open clusters, and in most cases it is extremely hard to tell whether you are seeing the cluster or not. The photos are no help, because they are all long photographic exposures taken through telescopes, nothing like what you actually see through binox."
1,"not the best guide, but not bad","Peterson's guide was my first as a child, so I don't want to bad mouth it, but it is not the best. Since then I have used just about every other guide available. Peterson's seems to have fallen behind in several areas. The illustrations are not as good as those in the National Geographic guide. The accidental and exoctic species are listed seperatly at the end of the book, and not all of the birds listed are shown!!! Im not sure if this is a mistake or not. Accidentals are also shown seperately, not alongside similar species or birds with similar appearance. This makes it somewhat confusing to identify some birds. Very little information is given about them, and usually there is nothing more than a head shot. I wouldn't use it as a primary reference, but it does make a good companion to other guides, especially ones with photographs rather than watercolors."
2,Delightful stories to complement the Raggedy Ann series.,"Raggedy Ann needed family, and along comes Raggedy Andy, her adorable brother. The books are the perfect accessory to the dolls I made for my sister-brother grandchildren. The stories are wholesome and sweet, just right for younger children. I heartily endorse these charming books."
2,Very Good Movie for Young Adults,"I have not read the book, but I have studied the Holocaust extensively.I am stunned that a few people say that it was not realistic enough, or that it was ""watered down."" This is a family movie!! This is a movie that is a good introduction to the Holocaust for 12-14 year olds. Do you really want a 12 year old to watch the Pianist or Schindler's List????The plot is lacking, and the acting could be improved. But this was a made for TV movie, and for what it is, it is great. Real enough to bring a tear to my eye.If you're an adult, I would not recommend it. But if you want to introduce the Holocaust to your teenager, it is an amazing movie."
1,hard as a rock,"I purchased this item based on the reviews but I must say I'm disappointed. I condsider the gel very hard for its purpose. It does position my wrist correctly but the gel is so hard that my wrist still ends up hurting. I am going to switch to a bean bag type and see if that is better. Regarding the smell, I do smell it when I put it to my nose but not when it is being used correctly. I don't have a problem with any smell."
1,Dissatisfied,"Beware - I purchased a new unit and upon the first use I noticed that max heat setting would not work. After approximately 10 seconds of use, the heater stopped and a buzzer went off. After letting the unit cool so that it would start up again, I tried several more times to get the unit to work properly. I began to notice a large internal spark on the internal coils and connectors.I view this as a serious safety hazard and am amazed that this wasn't discovered prior to shipment. I am staying away from Delonghi products from now on."
1,Very Disappointed!,"Like ""Claretta's"" review below, I'm finding I'm skipping more of the story than reading. I don't like either main character and find the plot very choppy. This is one of the worst Crusie books I've read and don't know if I'll finish it."
2,"Little known album, yet one of the greatest of the 80's","I was shopping at a record store in the 80's and saw this album in the dollar bin. It looked kinda cool, and even though I never heard of The Headpins, I bought it. Probably the best dollar I ever spent. This has to be one of the greatest 80's rock albums made. Tight musically, well arranged, and Darby Mills' sexy vocals make this one a must have. I wore out the album in the 80's, wore out a tape, and am trying to wear out my CD right now. Do yourself a favor and listen to the best thing to come out of Canada ... you won't regret it."
2,Awesome,"It was 20+ years ago that I first entered the land called Prydain. Since then, I have read the series several dozen times. I am into The Black Cauldron as we speak. The series does not disappoint and neither does this. I am currently reading through this as well, when not reading the Chronicles. This has everything one would want and expect. If you are a fan of the Chronicles of Prydain, you need this book. It is the Cliff Notes version of every person, place and thing in Prydain. You also get some of the background as to where Mr. Alexander got his ideas for the books. All in all, this is a wonderful addition to your collection. I agree with the others though, if you have never read the series, buy it first, read it, and buy this afterward."
2,Nice KVM for the price,"Switching between Windows XP and RedHat Linux and it works well and is easy via a buttong on the unit or by double 'ctrl' clicks. I also use a 17"" flat panet LCD monitor and the video quality is very good. The only thing I don't like about the unit is that the cables for the 2 pc's are on the sides of the unit. If it were a bit bigger and all the connectors on the rear... I would have rated 5 stars."
2,Nice twist on a wedding!,"I own an entertainment company and needed this for a wedding we were doing. It is a really nice way of integrating popular music into a wedding service without offending anyone. The bride was wanting ""Cruel Intentions"" for the service, but wanted to know if we had a ""clean"" version. After listening to this version, she was very satisfied. We use several of The String Quartet tribute albums because of this and they never let us down."
1,Butcher up the prequels all you want!,The Prequels already reek. Add more CGI to those and release them. Why not release the original Trilogy as the masterpieces they were? I will not be buying this. I am saddened that so many will put up with this nonsense and buy them anyway.
1,Don't waste your money - not worth it!,The diaper genie has one thing going for it and that's their name... but there's nothing magical about spending $4-$5 a cartridge to refill! It does keep the smell to a minimum but all diapers stink... no matter which method you use. I regret not having registered for the Diaper Champ. Everyone that has one tells me its better than the Diaper Genie. Maybe for the next baby!
1,Invacare offset cane model no. 40913,"I ordered an Invacare offset cane model no 40913, I received a cane of similiar size, color and cost however it was not the invacare offset cane I requested. It lacked the large surface area grip and the secondary stop (incase primary stop failed the cane will not fold). I am returning this order, I will attempt to obtain the proper cane from another vender. Please note the order was received in two work days and it was beautifully packaged."
1,"Great coffee, flimsy machine","I received this coffee maker as a gift two years ago. As a mechanical engineer, the machine itself makes my heart cry. The parts are a flimsy plastic that have been cracking slowly but surely over time. The pod holder is difficult to open and it feels like the handle will break if you push the end. I haven't had any problems with leaking or lukewarm coffee; the coffee itself comes out hot and tastes good. The only issue I've had is cracked parts."
1,not for us,The website I purchased this from won't let me leave a review so I'll do one here. This toaster lasted 3 days before we packed it up and shipped it back. No matter how low the setting the inside edge of the toast burned. If we set it at 1 it wouldn't toast and we had to toast it again and then the whole slice would burn. At 2 the edges would burn. For something over $100 you'd think it would work -at least for a few months. Very disappointed.
1,the picture is of a chrome rams add on! but it is really black!,I ordered this add on for my truck so to spice it up but in all reality it was a plastic stick on and was in a plastic abs black. not very appealing I sent it back.
2,A Strong Opening,"I've set about reading the John le Carré collection from start to finish, and as his first book this is a strong introduction to George Smiley and an interesting, fast moving tale. It's almost simple compared to some of the later intrigues, but in that there's interest by itself. You can take this book either as the opening to le Carré's work, or a good page turner of a mystery novel in its own right."
1,"Lackluster, not blockbuster",I am a big fan of the Twilight series and tore through them while on summer vacation a few years ago. I looked forward to Breaking Dawn but found the hype to be much more than the film itself. I think it was a big mistake to turn the final installation in the series into two separate films (obviously just to increase revenue). I found the ending of Part I to be an odd and disappointing place to cut away. The author knew what she was doing when she wrote the books and it was a travesty what the filmakers did to destroy it in this way. I was left very disappointed by this film. I should have waited for the second part to come out and then watched them both consecutively and perhaps then I wold have been more satisfied. Don't waste your time.
2,A Good Dictionary,"Even it's small it's very usefull in a variety of situations, especially on travel, a good summary of high used swedish words."
2,"Good product, but could be better","I owned an older model of this product and it sounded great. I broke the mic, I decided to get the newer one. The first one had a bad ear piece. Amazon sent a replacement right away. The replacement works great when it's positioned properly. If not, the speakers click on and off. Other than that, it sounds great. And I can't break the mic since it's in the headphone itself."
1,Not nearly as good as classic stratego,"My son has been asking for the original game having played it at friends houses and wants to get rid of this version. There's many flaws here compared to the original game...1 There's only 20 pieces per side but the 2 player board is the same size, leading to a lot of awkward open space2 The pieces are very hard to see from any angle but straight behind them, meaning you have to elevate the board to play the game3 The cards fall out of the slots in the pieces- we have lost a few and are frequently having to reassemble piecesAs I'm now being forced to go back and buy the original game, I figured I'd post this review as a warning to others."
1,"Nice Idea, Doesn't Work","Seems like a good idea, especially with the temperatures this summer. Unfortunately, this product just doesn't work. Doesn't stay cool and it's just a durable plastic with a foam core, there is nothing separating the water from the foam. You can't get the water out tolet this pad dry, hence the inside becomes moldy, and you can't replace all the water to get it cool again. Just doesn't work."
1,Fun to watch for its total lack of talent in front of or behind the camera,"The Mole People is one of those old sci-fi/horror movies that are fun to watch because of their ineptitude. MST3K did a good job with this particular roll of film when they were on the air. A group of archaeologists accidentally discover a race of people living underground. These people can't stand the light and when they see the scientist's flashlight they believe them to be Gods because they carry light in their cylinder. Only the high priest believes them to be mortal and he spends the movie trying to prove it to his king. The humans try to find a way out of the Mole People kingdom and cause a rebellion among a group of creatures they have enslaved to do their labor. It's all done very badly and with no action or suspense whatsoever. The script is stretched tight to make a full movie out of a twenty minute plot. The Mole People is not a well made movie, but can be fun to watch nonetheless."
1,Certainly not a classic,"""Beyond Management by Objectives"" [1966] by Joseph Batten is rather disappointing and does not live up to the author's reputation. How this short volume ever made it to a second [1980] and then third [2003] printing is beyond me. Clearly his other two books ""Tough-Minded Management"" [1963] and ""Tough-Minded Leadership"" [1989] are superior, though in my opinion ""Tough-Minded Management"" is the better of the two. Readers will be hard pressed to find enough advanced leadership DNA in ""Beyond Management by Objectives"" so as to justify the two hours it takes them to read it."
2,excellent book,My daughter is two years old and loves this book. It has helped her to learn how to read. She reads the words back to us andher teachers. It also teachs her to have patience and that mommy is always near by. I am going to buy more llama books.
1,Not a sweet treat for Valentine's Day,"While Rachel Gibson has always been one of my favortie contemporary romance novelists, this book is one to skip. The story is forced; it has no natural flow. Unlike others from her that have kept me up at night until finished, this one put me to sleep - several times before I finally completed it. Also, I read romance novels to escape the stress of a hectic worklife and the craziness of our country's current domestic and foreign policies that are destroying our international reputation and leading us to moral and financial bankruptcy. I do not want to read about a principal character using voting for the first Bush as a timeframe in her life. Please, I know the author is from Idaho, but can we skip the red state/blue state intrusion into what should be relaxing literature?"
1,More about author's self promotion than any real self help,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read several books on hypnosis and self hypnosis and some have been very helpful. The main thing about this book that really bothered me is that it kept selling (er, referring to) the author's wonderful and unique ""Sidman Solution"". Since several of the other hypnosis books I have read refer to the exact same thing as ""age regression"" I guess coming up with a catchy name and calling it your own may be a great marketing tool for the author. I just wish the book had really had some new and useful information and wasn't obviously written as an ego thing for the author. I am not sure where all the glowing reviews came from, but I can guess since all the five star reviews only reviewed this book and nothing else. All I can tell you from my experience is there are far better books out there that will give you better information with much less hype."
1,Horton Hatches the Egg,I was very disappointed when I received this book in the mail. It said it was in good shape but when I got the book there were stickers all over the front of the book. I was able to take the stickers off but was still disappointed it said nothing about them being on there when I ordered the book.
2,gary@mcsweeneyassociates.com,"Larry Mullins and Dr. Meredith Sprunger have provided the peoples of Urantia with a wonderfully historical resource surrounding the evolution and early dissemination of the Urantia Papers and Urantia Book dating back to 1906. This inspired accounting will assist every reader towards gaining a more holistic perspective of the individual and collective activities required to bring to print this Fifth Epochal Revelation for all humanity. A must read for all Urantia Book readers and perhaps more importantly, required reading for all earth travelers. A First Edition must!"
2,Excellant!,"BUNN makes that best coffee maker in the world! This is my third unit over the years and I would not buy another brand and highly recommend it to everyone. When you need Great Coffee FAST, get a BUNN!"
2,I loved this book! What is wrong with you people?,"I liked this book a lot. It had all the elements that I like in my romance novels...intigue, passion, and humor---and do I love her humor. I do belive this is one of my favorites right now, but had avoided it for a while due to the opinions of others. Pish-Posh!! Mad Jack was fantastic!!"
1,Unworkable Scale,"Scale was light, appearing easy to use. Followed instructions to the tee, and scale only would work every 5 minutes or so. It gave out different weights with the same person on it, and then it would ""give-out"" entirely and not even work at all."
1,Horrid!,"This was a horrid book! I couldn't do any of the ideas it offered, except the petty ones (as in the example above, 'sneak your own snacks into the theater'). I found it rediculous, uninspiring, and a waste of money that could have bought my boyfriend something fabulous (another streatch, but who cares?)"
2,Great Read,"A quick, easy read this book opens your eyes to the crazy life of the top professional poker players."
2,Detective Barbie at the Carnival,"I found this game a bit too hard or a glitch in there.After looking for Ken and the clues seemed futile, my daughter and I really enjoyed the rides.We quit worrying about find Ken and figured he left the park, so we went on the rides.It is fun, but a few minutes of rides and we were ready to leave the park."
2,A side of Kerouac you seldom see,"Everyone knows of Kerouac's famous road trips, hitchhiking or riding the rails. And Lowell, Mass. is famous as his hometown. But few think of Kerouac's time spent in Florida, which was actually where he found fame on the publishing of On the Road and where he wrote, among others, the stellar Dharma Bums.Kealing depicts Kerouac's life in Florida in a starkly honest way, sprinkling interviews with neighbors and friends along with the story of the last 10 years of Kerouac's life. You get a sense of Kerouac's mad love of nature and his family as well as the depression that drove him to drink himself to death. It's a very moving account of the life of an often-misunderstood literary genius."
1,"Amusing movie, awful print","There are plenty of poor quality DVDs on the market, and this is one of the worst. This is an amusing Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, but the copy is taken from a duped and edited C & C Television print; the original runs 74 minutes and this copy runs 62! To add insult to injury, this is a bad dupe; the climactic shoot-out takes place in a darkened hotel, and here it looks like they're in one of those Warner Brothers cartoon caves where only the eyeballs are visible. Bad sound, bad picture quality, and edited to hell-yuck! Anyone in the market for this title should get the Alpha Video edition, which is the best copy of this title currently available (and it's complete)."
1,Replacement Battery,This extended life replacement battery does not last as long as the old battery it replaced.
1,Bootleg,I purchased this because of the picture and that it said it was the official headband. I was shipped a bootleg headband that was falling apart upon opening the package. Very disappointed.
2,an inspiration!,"gary versace - organmark ferber - drumsjonathan kreisberg - guitareverything i want to here from a jazz trio, all three of these musicians are clearly masters but to watch mark ferber live is unforgettable. kreisberg has truely inspired me to reach this level of jazz."
1,Voodoo on a train,The story is a woman has been voodoo cursed and is headed into town for a cure but on the way she unleashes a bunch of snakes from her body that terrorize a trains passengers. The fact that the snakes come from her stomack and that they look like giant worms is a warning all by itself. The asylum continues to put out Cheap Spin-offs that completely flops and makes its origins sick.
2,Awesome,The dawn of electronic music. A must have for anyone. Wendy is phenominal. I have this on vinyl and the CD brings forth a much greater amount of subtleties.
2,Wonderful cd,If you like Esther Phillips or Dinah Washington you will certainly love Irene Reid. Vocals and arrangements are great. This is my first cd of Irene but certainly not my last. The great review from a jazz magazine is the reason I bought the cd. I absolutely need to thank them for turning me on to such a great artist.
1,Mine died after 30 minutes use,"Amazon shipped quickly. The grinder is a comfortable size and weight. The paddle switch is easy to use and is a nice safety feature. I've used it now for 2 jobs but it suddenly died on the 2nd job - after no more than 30 minutes total combined use. I used it when it arrived to cut cabinet openings into Hardieboard (concrete board), a 20 minute job. I used it again two weeks later to cut three 18 in square concrete pavers in half. After 5-10 minutes use, it just stopped working while I cutting the 3rd paver. I now have to send it to a factory service center and I hope they replace it with a new one without a hassle.12/5/08I had this repaired under warranty. I was told by the factory-approved service ctr that the problem was a broken wire. No further problems since it's been serviced."
2,Funniest Movie I have ever seen!!!!,A lot of people tell me I have dry-humor and I don't laugh at things most people would. I'm sorry but I just don't see the humor in someone getting hit is the face with a sign or nasty jokes. But Get Him to The Greek is the exception to like every rule I have about comedy. It's seriously the funniest thing I have watched in my entire life! You have to see this movie.
1,I got screwed,Shy 2 bolts. How hard is it to count to 8? Riding the new deck will have to wait another day.
1,Smells Bad,"I have had several kerosene heaters over many years. I had looked for the same brand I had always used, but couldn't find it. That company no longer sells in the U.S. due to excessive lawsuits.I figured this newer brand would work well, and was disappointed to find that it gave off a very strong and bothersome odor when on. I have had enough experience to know how to deal with that problem generally, but nothing worked, including having followed the several procedures shown in the manual.I may have just gotten a ""bad"" heater, one in which the combustion wasn't taking place right or was otherwise off, but my experience was bad enough that I returned the heater.Craig"
2,"Don't be fooled ""Faith"" is not the only good song on this Cd","Almost everybody has heard ""Faith"" and just started going crazy. It is that kind of song. In my eyes, it might be the best song of the ninties, but it isn't a song that you just sit down and listen to over and over. That is why you can't be fooled and think that ""Faith"" is the only good song on this Cd. The whole Cd is great. You can listen to every single song over and over and never get bored. This Cd is great. I love it and I know all of you do too."
2,want to try,I can fruits and vegetables but have not tried meats yet so thought it'd be a cool book to learn something helpful & new. Can't wait to try a few.
1,Died After Two Years,I bought this because I hate taking batteries to the hazardous waste disposal. Save your receipt and packaging.
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"I bought this book thinking I would get some new and exciting information about the Powershot G5. Some tips and tricks on getting better photographs USING the G5 features. Instead, this book is just a combination of the EXACT same content from the Users Manual and any basic book on photography. Nothing new. Nothing exciting. Nothing interesting.It was also a big let down when I saw it. It's actually a bunch of black and white photocopies (Xerox) bound together in a spiral. Like a school report from the early 90's. It shouldn't cost more that five dollars.I believe the auther and publishers just put it together just to make some easy money. And I fell for it. I should've known when it had no reviews.After this, I will NEVER buy another book from them and I strongly suggest you see it before you buy it. No wonder you can't see the inside in amazon!!!"
1,Did not work for my dog,I was hoping this product would be the cure to my dog's barking...it seemed to work for about two days....but then my dog decided she didn't mind the citronella spray...and she's barking just as loudly as ever with the collar on and squirting her in the face! I would not recommend this product...as I'm out $36 with nothing to show for it.
1,Overrated and awfully boring,"I think this has been one of the most overrated pictures in recent years. When it came to town I was really anxious to see what many reviewers commented in the papers: that it was a great movie. However, once I saw it, what a dissapointment! I thought it was so dull, uninteresting and terribly boring. None of the characters was attractive to me; on the contrary, I always felt them distant and cold. And that's exactly what the movie is, a piece of ice which does not move anybody. I agree 100% in saying that it's a big waste of time and money. It was Oscar nominated? You must be kidding! Here in Chile, it was a one-week fad and then faded away."
1,okay,I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. after reading the good reviews I thought it would be a heavy quality made toaster. I am glad I didn't pay more than I did because it doesn't feel heavy or like quality. I have to leave it on number one or the toast comes out black. I thought cuisinart was always quality. I don't think that anymore...
2,Acoustic is GOOD,"I just bought the album today and have listened to it 3 times. I just wanted to comment on the people I see ripping the 2nd disc - I thought it was the best!! My girlfriend and I got in an argument right before I had a chance to listen to the second disc (we were following each other in different cars, thank God) and the second disc made me forget all about it! I seriously think Razor is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. As for the 1st disc, it's pretty good too - regular old Foo - I'm glad to get something new. Buy the cheaper disc - it's worth it! While you're at it, pick up the new White Stripes and System of a Down - I buy pretty much all the new rock and those two albums are GREAT! The Exies is another sleeper/surprise worth picking up - Enjoy!"
2,Starts out slow...but gets much better,"I bought this for my 3 boys, ranging from age 10-16. The game starts out pretty slow, with the character as a little boy, but gets much better. You have to choose between good and evil all throughout the game, and live with the consequences. Great concept... :-)"
1,Unreadable,"Reading this book is almost impossible. It is poorly written, and mostly boring. In some parts, the ones in which the author attempts to explain how Geller supposedly cheated on some of his scientific test, the book reads like a Tom Clancy novel - without the suspense. Mr Randi explains in depth the high-tech electronic devices which could have been invented to help Mr. Geller. Yes, Mr. Randi, and the CIA is using your neighbor's satellite dish to read your thoughts..."
2,CeCe does it again!!!! Beautiful Album,If you don't have it go pick it up. This album is beautiful and uplifting. True praise and worship from CeCe.
2,"Great flavor, great energy.","Even the ""plain"" flavor was much better than I expected. I had my heart set on getting the Vanilla Bean, but it was often out of stock. I opted for to try other flavors to test others and was surprised by how good tasting they all were. I actually enjoy matching my workout moods with the different flavors! Now I will just get this mixed flavors box every time."
2,An awesome direction for Terry Pratchett,"Ive read the entire Disc World series. This book didn't have any of the usual characters and at first I was upset, wanting more from the disc world. BUT though it took a bit to develop this book is really really awesome. Some very unexpected directions and well developed ideas towards the end.Also, some well developed thoughts about our human view of potentially meeting aliens and how we may interact.A very very interesting book that I look forward to re-reading some time in the future."
1,"Nice plot, awful writing","Mr. Brown's plot is thought-provoking and complex, though his writing reminds one of the entries in a high school literary magazine. It's a shame that such an interesting premise was tarnished by poor writing. Mr. Brown's heavy-handed foreshadowing makes what could have been several interesting plot twists obvious and mundane, and his liberal doses of ""character development"" read like his editor told him he had to put in some background on the main characters...on pages 87, 225, 316, and so on...making the supposedly enlightening looks into the histories of the characters seem misplaced and trite.Next time, Mr. Brown, come up with the story-line and let someone with real writing talent author the book."
2,"All good, but the ending.","I thought that this book was really good.I loved the way it always had somthing going on to keep your intrest. The only thing i didn't like about it is the ending, it kind of dissapointed me."
1,Where's the integrity?,"The NYT digital subscription is like the old roach motel - you can get in but you can't get out.First problem they hit your credit card every 28 days instead of once a month. Sneaky. After a while you have no idea when is the end of the billing cycle (which is when you want to cancel).Second, to cancel you have to call, on a telephone. WHY IS THAT??? Believe me, the wait is long, looong. When (if) they finally answer, the struggle begins.Third, the reps are such liars. Mine said, ""Sir, you are cutting out, I am going to have to hang up..."" and she did. I was calling on a land line! It was infuriating. What am I to think of that company's reporting truth if they have such little regard for it while talking to a person?The 99 record clubs of my teenage years had more integrity than the NYT!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Thankfully I checked this book out of the library. Since I hadn't been impressed by ""Noble Intentions"", I didn't want to take a chance buying this one. I can read about anything, but this was such drivel I just skimmed over the book. From what I read, the writing was poor, the characters annoying, and the ""love scenes"" insipid. I won't waste my time with another book by this author."
1,An Astoundingly Awful Movie,I am a fan of the science fiction genre but there is no amount of lipstick you could put on this pig to make it palatable. This is a truly terrible movie.
2,Nifty vent a hood,Purchased this for the apartment sized stove at my lake house. Especially like the light. Venting is ok - don't have it ducted. Looks nice and was easy for my husband to install. Price was cheaper than home improvement store.
1,Many Laughs,"You would need a calculus formula to calculate the amount of breakdowns on this CD, and a strong will to find a part of a song that isn't a breakdown. Typical mosh pit nonsense, with intense militant lyrics to back it all up: ""Nowhere to hide, searching for a piece of pie!"" This disc will leave you hungrier for a good song than the singer is for a piece of pie."
2,Spreadable Butter Anytime-A Wondeful Thing,"The Norpro Butter Keeper is one of those products I wish I had purchased years ago. I have always kept butter out of the fridge in a covered dish but, inevitably, the butter would go bad in a couple of weeks. With the Norpro, I can enjoy butter for a month or more and it is always perfectly spreadable. Also, the design is very functional, with the lid acting as a stand when flipped upside down. Overall, this is a great product, welcome in any toast-lovers kitchen."
1,Horrible!,"I enjoyed Angels & Demons, and I am a computer person & interested in Crypto, so I thought i'd give this a try.The plot is laughable -- big enough holes to drive a truck through. For people who are supposedly so bright, I wanted to slap the heck out of the main characters for their stupidity.The ""science"" is completely made up, and a lot of things just simply do not make any sense. I know Dan Brown is not a scientist, and he was writing a popular novel, but it would have made the book MUCH better if he had bothered to do any kind of research beyond simply a high-level skim and then make it up as he went along.I got 7/8ths of the way through this, and then gave up. I just could not make myself continue with it, and I really didn't care enough about the characters to see what happened to them."
2,Another quality Zyliss product,"Zyliss makes quality products; I've learned to trust the brand name. This garlic press has proved to be indispensable. It's easy to clean and easy to use. You don't have to peel the garlic, and every bit of the garlic gets used. I've owned it for four years now and I expect that it will last for many years to come. This is an item I use almost daily in my kitchen. It's durable and built to last. Well worth the investment. I would buy any product with the Zyliss name."
2,Consistent quality,"I have used Hemke reeds for the last 20 years. I discarded one the other day after only beginning to play with it, but I do not remember the last time I had to to that. The reeds do not typically warp. They are cut to center every time. The strength is consistent among boxes, and the tone is always great. They are my reed of choice for my C*(s), yanganasawa jazz, vandoren jazz, and otto link mouthpieces. I use them on alto, soprano, and tenor. I would love it if they could maintain strength longer, and I usually have to dispose of them within a few weeks after I begin playing on them, but non-synthetic reeds can't last forever."
1,"The day it arrived, I tested it against another meter...","I needed a meter, but it's only for hobby use. I decided to go with something more reasonably priced(I guess that was my mistake, but it seems like others have had good luck, so far).The first thing I did was open the meter to replace the batteries. As soon as I opened the case, a large ball of solder fell out of the meter. Not a good sign. I looked at the internal components, curious about whether or not it was poorly constructed. I see a transistor that has two leads soldered together, a SMD capacitor that seems to be barely attached, and when I tested the meter, it got vastly different values from changing range on the same 100k resistor.For a 12k resistor, my other meter shows 11.2k. When I measure the same resistor with the 3310, I get .007 for the 2k setting. When I measure the same resistor, I get 0.1 for the 200k setting.So, instead of trying to fix this thing myself, I'm returning it. Guess I'll buy a higher end meter."
1,Lacked Pizazz,"Cinderella has always been my favorite fairy tale, which is why I was so looking forward to a new twist on it. However, while this book had some clever ideas the writing was less than thrilling and many of the themes needed more explanation. I did not really care about the characters and felt they needed more depth."
1,A blot on Inkheart,"I loved Ms. Funke's previous work the Thief Lord (although the ending was somewhat abrupt) and that is what led me to this book. Given that she demonstrated a fine ability to craft likable and believable characters in her earlier work, I am going to have to attribute this horribly stilted and pedantic piece to the work of the translator. I tried many times to plough through this story but kept getting turned off by how trite and one dimensional the characters seemed and how stilted the dialogue was. The idea is a magnificent one but it cant get out because of how poorly this was done. The only other example of ruining a perfectly good story with atrocious dialoge that comes to mind is Lucas's final three films. The concepts are lofty and the vision is there but the actors deliver their lines without any feeling. Sorry Ms. Funke -- you flunked."
1,CSI was NOT 1.33:1,"This release is not proper. CSI was 16:9 HD from day one. Why, oh why is it not being released in the correct aspect ratio? Beware!"
2,Great product/ Great service,"This double-rail Z-rack is a great product, and definitely lives up to its reputation. The only problem was that the rack arrived without any assembly instructions in the box. When I phoned Need-a-Rack's customer service line, to tell them of the omission, they apologized for the oversight and immediately e-mailed the instructions to me. Love this product and was very pleased by Need-a-Rack's service. The product arrived in just 4 days - well ahead of its scheduled delivery date!"
1,Lacking in Depth and Originality,"Clarke and Hardy are so used to buying into the fascist propaganda of the Bush Regime, they forgot to employ the elements of credible research and simple truth-telling. One of their masters, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, indicated that since the American people are lied to all the time, it is okay for him and his ilk to continue in that tradition. Can you imagine the contempt they must have for the average U.S. citizen? Perhaps, Rumsfeld is correct in his assessment after all since the Republicans easily won the Presidency and added to their majority in Congress in the 2004 election. Actually, I believe that H.L. Mencken was closer to the truth when he quipped, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" We have become a very intellectually lazy people."
2,Great for MRE's or Bug-Out Bags,"I bought this book specifically because I want to make my own MRE's for my Bug-Out Bag. I have food allergies and cannot eat the typical emergency preparedness food. I will be using this book for that (and mine won't look and taste like barf in a bag.)I am so happy for the practical advice and experience of the author. Very helpful. I'm sure I'll be using it for summer fun, too."
1,Solitare Game,"buttons do not work very well, very poor product. Cannot even use. I would not recommend this game to anyone"
2,Really nice,"This is just a lovely jacket, it is nice when its heat, it is nice when its cold. I think if it ever comes in black I definately will buy it. Also it is a fair price"
1,Very Disappointed Clancy Fan,"I have read and enjoyed almost every TC novel that he has created, and can honestly say that this is the most disappointed I have ever been. The plot was predictable and without incident. The culmination was not intriguing. It took me two attempts to actually read the book. The first time through, I couldn't even make it through the first hundred pages, the story was very boring.On a positive side, if you are new to clancy try reading without remorse or the cardinal of the kremlin. don't waste your money on this book though."
1,Wont fit the bigger ATW wagon,"I bought these pads for the bigger ATW wagon. They are way too small and will not fit. When I tried to send them back the vendor replied ""with the money you are going to have to spend on mailing them back to us, plus the re-stocking fee, you should just donate them, sorry""What great service huh?"
1,Republican Yes-Man for AM Radio,"As an independent voter, Bob Grant makes it hard to vote Republican; a few weeks listening to the Bob Grant Show on my way home from work has certainly put me off GW for this November. While undoubtedly a clever man, the intolerance in this man's speech is sickening, amusing and bewildering all at the same time. What's worse is that his show comes under the guise of a forum of free speech, when in actuality it is entirely one-sided. For all his distaste with the mainstream media, I think if he sat back for a minute and consulted with liberals he would find an equal amount of disgust with what so many conservatives dub the ""liberal media.""While I enjoy some conservative commentators, Grant is an unapologetic Republican sycophant that make him hard to stomache and difficult to take seriously.I'd love to discuss this topic with anyone who's willing at cdgprince@netscape.net, send me a note."
2,Great film... I enjoyed the hell out of it!,"Clever, quirky characters, and excellent acting. Full of sex and violence--not for the easily offended--but delivered with panache, and always in service to the plot. Really funny too... I loved all of the dark comedic moments. An excellent first-effort by screenwriter Paul Osborne. Can't wait to see what's next."
2,Music Stand,"K&M Music Stand is light-weight and collapsable. However, it is a little tricky to unfold and can be easily bent out of shape, if you do not unfold it properly. I got around the problem by labeling with an indelible marker which arms go up and which go down in the setting up process."
2,Nice design but could be bigger,"Well made, good design, but for a large strainer, it could be bigger. I like the fact that it has two pieces at the end that hold the pan."
1,Adoption Nation,"Adoption Nation provides an interesting historical and sociological account of adoption. However, the author has a very clear bias and is not afraid to let it show throughout the book. He presents important facts, many of which I have not found in other books, however he does not fail to insert his own opinion about these facts in every place possible. If you agree with Mr. Pertman that absolutely open adoption is the only healthy alternative, international adoption is misguided, and that non-traditional families are morally incorrect when they wish to adopt healthy children (as Mr. Pertman and his wife did), then you will read this book without cringing. If, like me, you disagree with any of any of his very clear biases, then you will find his lack of journalistic objectivity disappointing."
2,The West Wing - Complete Series Collection,I purchased this set for my husband for Christmas. I couldn't have found a more perfect gift if I had searched all year. He is a tremendous fan of the series and was truly thrilled to have ALL of it. We have been watching an episode here and there since Christmas and have enjoyed every minute - both of us.
1,The Movie was Better,"I don't usually dis something on the grounds that the original was better. You'd think with the technology available today, a remake of The Taking... would be as least as good if not better than the original with Walter Matthau, but 5 minutes into the DVD and you know you're wrong. This is a lesson in how to take an exciting, engrossing, fast-paced plot and turn it into a plodding, badly acted, poorly executed ""who cares"" movie. We couldn't stay awake for this one."

2,A thoughtful look at the romance genre.,"This is a great collection of scholarly essays by well-known romance authors about the genre. Any serious romance fan will find this a fascinting read. I was continually impressed by the profound insights in this book. Not only is it a compelling response to the many unenlightened critics of the genre, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of how romance novels reflect the changing face of women's issues in this country. I particularly enjoyed the article by Susan Elizabeth Phillips called ""The Romance and the Empowerment of Women."" Also, Laura Kinsale's article about how readers respond to the point of view of the narrative was fascinating. This should be mandatory reading for all romance editors."
2,the best meditation!,"i first witnessed sylvia browne on montel williams several years ago..and she gave me chills. she seems so ""right on"" and sincere. i've used and enjoyed these tapes. i've tried other meditation tapes but have never received the results that i've gotten from these tapes. i've never gone so deep as i have with sylvia's words. her sincerity and warmth come shining through as she helps you relax, heal and become a more spiritual person. i highly recommend these tapes:)"
2,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Business,"Although I touch type, my old ergonomic keyboard had seen better days. I didn't realize how much noise my older keyboard made when I started using the new one. This keyboard is very quiet. I would recommend to anyone who has problem with their hands. I purchased my first ergonomic keyboard when I developed tendonitis in my right arm."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"I read this book because of the high sales it hadAlso as i was reading the back cover of the book it seemed really interesting, so I said ""why not?""I bought it and... boom!The book was bad, and it was getting worst with every pageThe author had a really good theme to talk about, the idea is really really good, but it's written in an awful way.The story of an old man who dies and sees all the people that had an influence on him. It sounds good, but believe me it's a WASTE OF TIME.I read the whole book because I have the habit of ending every book (even if they're like these). It was a big punishment, an agony, It took me a week to complete it.I didn't connect with the story, the book promises a lot and at the end is only a very soft book, that PRETENDS to give you THE spiritual message that will change your life.An advice: If you really, really, really hate a person give this book as a gift."
1,Gift? Not so much!,"I suffer from depression and hoped this book would do for me what the other reviewers state, and the cover promised. Nothing could have been further from my experience. As someone who does fear what my depression may hold for me in the future, the first two stories, about someone who ultimately killed himself, and another who also feared the future, I was terribly depressed. The book simply killed any hope I had. I REFUSE to read any more, and I will not donate or share it, but destroy it."
1,ARRRGH!,"Beware! This is not the show Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed that was running on The Learning Channel and Discovery a few years ago. I goofed and bought this disc, which dramatizes 3 stories per episode and challenges the audience to guess which one really happened and which ones are only Urban Myths. The trouble is if you're an Urban Legend enthusiast like me, you already are familiar with these stories and this show doesn't fill in the background on the legends like ""Mostly True Stories"" does. So you end up with some hokey dramatizations which would tip off even someone who has never heard the stories to which ones ""actually happened"". Hence, I can't recommend this DVD to anyone and now I need to try to sell the damn thing. BTW-I didn't buy it on Amazon. I wish I had since I could have saved some money."
1,Sugar,"If you hate country music, you will love this album. Rascal Flatts are everything that is wrong with country music today. ""Me and My Gang"" is the furthest thing from a country song I have ever heard, yet country radio laps it up, and lets legends like Merle Haggard and George Jones lay in the ditch.My advice is don't buy this garbage if you enjoy country music. It will only make you mad."
1,Pius the 12th silent?,"This book claims that Pope Pius the 12th and the Catholic Church, for the most part were silent during the Holocaust. In a way that is true. The Pope learned early in the war that to speak out against the Nazis only brought about more severe retributions. Even leading Jewish clerics warned him not to do so. Instead he acted behind the scenes to save the lives of Jews, Gypsies, and others. He ordered Vatican buildings,convents and monasteries to hide and protect these hunted human beings from being slaughtered to the best of his ability. He ordered false baptismal and Communion documents to be printed up and given to these oppressed people. He even provided money and gold of his own to purchase freedom for some. Lets remember that the Vatican itself was an occupied country during the war. The fact that the Pope and the Catholic Church saved as many as 800,000 Jews during the war speaks volumns in itself.Would that the rest of the world had been as silent."
2,God's desire for a Love filled Marriage,Wow! We are so excited to have this in our home and in our hearts! The Lord is using Ken Nair to change lives forever!
2,Good service.,"The DVD arrived incredibly quickly. I have yet to watch it, but I love SWEENEY TODD, so I know it will be good."
2,beautiful & affordable! WOW!!!,I got these to match the curtain rod - and both items are exceptional in quality and beauty. It's refreshing to find quality made items at a reasonable price.
1,Droning and Moaning,"fitter happier. more productive. if only this were true. radiohead must be some sad sad fools to make music like this. talented, yes. enjoyable, no. if i want to feel the way i do when i hear this, i can go to a funeral parlor. for the time being, i'll be anxiously awaiting the next weezer album."
1,Half of AA slots don't work after a year,"After warranty expired, 6 of the 8 AA slots don't work while all the AAA still work. I've been charging only PowerEx IMedion 2100 mAh AA and 800 mAh AA batteries. The company offered to replace with a 25% discount, but that brings the replacement price down to $82.46.I expected more quality for this lightly used charger, so I couldn't recommend this model to others."
1,No Picture after only 18 months !,"I purchased a Samsung LN-T4665 from Amazon. After only 18 months of purchase, the TV has stopped working - NO picture. Samsung customer service says they cannot do anything since it is outside the warranty period. Repair estimate (from a Samsung authorized technician) is more than the cost of a new set.There are numerous posts regarding the same issue for Samsung LCD TVs - on Amazon and other websites (see links below).[...]It is unfortunate that Samsung is not doing anything to address this recurring issue. My advice - stay away from Samsung LCD TVs."
2,Works for the SD750 too,"I bought this for my SD750, and it fits perfectly. It's kind of ugly and bulky, but I'd rather the camera be protected than have a nice looking case."
1,Self-Pitying Yawn,"I found the main character way too self-involved and written t be overly cute. Yuck. It's awful to read a book with characters you don't even like. The bulk of the plot was describing Kai's boxing life with the YMCA. Who cares? I was left asking, ""What happened later?"". It's a shame because the story would have been of some interest in had focused more on his relationships with other people and his life in general. The little biography on the flapcover was more interesting that his memior. Overall it was quite disappointing- too bad good writing had to go to waste."
1,Too heavy for its binding adhesive,"I've always liked these magnetic notepads that you can just slap on the fridge. With them, I manage to forget far fewer things when I shop at the grocery store (I'm sure I'll always forget something - with my faulty memory I can hide my own Easter eggs - but since the dawn of magnetic notepads, I don't have those moments where I go to the store just to get milk and come back everything but milk).When I found this notepad, I was pleased, because it is about 1/2"" thick, which means lots of pages so I don't go through pads as often. Wrong. What it meant was that I used a few pages off the top and then the pad fell apart under its own weight. All of the pages fell to the floor in a clump, bound by their overtaxed adhesive binding, leaving the cardboard backing with the magnet sitting proudly and uselessly on my fridge.The pad is now on my kitchen counter and is just enough out of the way that I'm back to forgetting the milk again."
2,"A great, albeit quick, read!","I'm so tired of music biographies where the subject is either villainized or practically canonized; none of us are perfect saints, nor are we completely evil. That's why I always find it refreshing when a writer presents the true person, most of whom are a little of both. Piazza has done that here.Martin is something of a tragic figure; a mad genius. In candid interviews, Piazza has found all the good in the man, as well as peeled back some of the bad. He shows that if Martin had been born in another era, or been a king of another genre, he would have been a hero, but in the holier-than-thou bluegrass scene, the hard-living Martin was considered something of a black sheep, despite his obvious brilliance.This is a great book, and definitely one of the best music biographies ever written."
2,Beautiful and informative,Great to look at and also really informative. These recipes aren't the typical bowls of oil associated with Spanish cooking as it's known internationally. The information on the various regions is a really nice touch too. Probably the only Spanish cooking book you need.
1,There are no holes in the pan,"I realize the price is exceptional, however, I do expect to get the item that is pictured. There are no holes in the pan I received. It is not dishwasher safe. It does not state that it is but it should tell you that you have to wash it by hand. I am very disappointed and would not have purchased the pan I received had I known what it was beforehand."
1,"Interesting views, but obscured by prose","Disturbing as it may be, the author certainly has a point. Life isn't always as beautiful as we may believe it to be, and this awakening is traumatic but necessary. The only problem with this moral is that it's nearly impossible to find.Ms. Ray does an excellent job of imparting the narrator's emotions though voice and mannerism, capturing the angst of a confused fourteen-year-old. The only problem with this is that it's nearly impossible to understand what's being said for lack of readable sentance structure and over-abundant cursing. More than once, I found myself re-reading pages to figure out what had just happened, and by that time, the action had been completely interrupted.In short, the novel was an excellent ""snapshot"" of a confused teen, but as a story, I found it somewhat lacking."
2,Excellent,"Rock Legends land on scene with this album. LZ 2nd album and it is AWESOME! Nuff said, go buy it."
2,Good investment,"I purchased this suit online for one purpose.I plan to wear it on formal nights for an upcomingcruise. So, I benefit by it also serving as fit towear anywhere! This is an extremely good hundreddollar suit. Great value for the money!"
2,Great DVD,"I have owned the CD and book since January 2004 and after alot of thought, I brought the DVD. I loved it alot. Some of the songs and scenes are not on the CD or book, which is great. A thing I would like to say. I had no problems playing the DVD on my Australian PS2 games and DVD player connected to a common medium sized TV one can get here."
1,CASBAH HUMMUS,"AGAIN, KIND OF A DOWNER COMPARED TO THE FANTASTIC FOODS BRAND. I KNOW THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR, BUT SOMETHING IN THE TASTE AND CONSISTENCY IS JUST NOT SPOT ON. LOOK FOR THE ""FANTASTIC FOODS"" BRAND AND DO YOURSELF A FAVOR."
1,Not a miracle worker,This pan doesn't seem to cook crusts any better than any other pizza pan. The holes are rather a pain too between dough cooking into the holes (time intensive clean-up!)and crumbs covering your counter when you cut a crispy crust.
2,Excellent Product,"This is my Third pair of these headphone, The first two were damaged because of my own fault and i keep buying them cause there some of the best headphones you can find for the price. I Use them for EVERYTHING, Movies, Music, and Games. The sound quality is AMAZING, It feels like the sound is live. I found that setting the EQ to Jazz on certain devices that offer it sound the best on these headphones."
1,Not very impressed,"I was really excited to get this book but unfortunately I was not very impressed with it's recipes. All the recipes were in metric which is not a big deal because it is not hard to convert. Some of the ingredients I have never heard of though and doubt that I could get them in an American grocery store. Besides that, the actual recipes themselves didn't really seem to be all that great anyways. I ordered 660 Curries along with this book which I highly recommend. All the recipes in that book look great and the author explains things very well along with having a sense of humor. I will be returning the Curry Bible to Amazon."
2,Excellent book,"Can't believe I'm the first to review this book. Anyway...excellent novel. Love the way Greg describes the working of the Iron man/War Machine armor. it was good to see the ""first"" War Machine armor design (don't like the ""alien"" armor). It was also nice to see a ""flashback"" of the reasoning behind the origin of Tony's armor. Guess i'll have to read the next book...when i get a chance to pick it up"
1,Lighted Magnifier,It's difficult finding a good quality magnifier. The magnification lens in this product tends to distort - not a good quality lens at all. The handle and lens frame are pretty cheaply made as well. It probably won't last very long before it falls apart. The 2 AAA batteries do make it a little heavy. I wouldn't buy this product again.
1,I'm not happy with this deal,One of the microphones arrived spoiled. It doesn't run well.It was not a good deal through Amazon web site.
1,"Fine for 1997, but boring in 2006","Reissues can be tricky. Some are just wonderful. I love reading Mary Balogh's or Jo Beverly's reissues because they write timeless storylines and truly powerful books no matter when they are published. This one, however, pales 9 years after it was first published. The endless plotline with Bonaparte, French spying, and smuggled goods has been done to death. If Enoch had done some editing before this was reissued and reduced all the extra ""intrigue"", the book would have been much better. The relationship between Kit and Alex is still good. But, it takes soooo long for anything to happen between them. I got bored long before they develop any kind of relationship. Skimming 2/3 of the book was frustrating. I feel thoroughly dissatisfied with the money I spent on this one."
2,Riveting History,"The Company is one of the most riveting modern historical novels, especially for people who have lived at the time of events from the early 1950s to the 1990s, which are covered in its span.The depiction of many real-life characters in American Government and in the CIA are quite chilling in Littell`s description of the madness and incompetence that has pervaded much of the CIA`s history, none more so than the hapless James Jesus Angleton, who for years told Kim Philby everything the CIA was doing and yet still managed to hold his post as CIA Cheif of Counter-Intelligence for decades after Philby`s unmasking."
2,The Old Curiosity Shop,"We got it very promptly, and in perfect condition. It was great to come back from a vacation and have it waiting for us. I like anything that Derek Jacobi is in. He is such a great actor."
1,Nice Idea But Poor Execution,"I bought the Roomba with high hopes. I enjoy gadgets and thought that this would be useful but it just turned out to be a headache. The Roomba continually got stuck on any carpeting it happened upon or tricking spot it could get wedged into. I would come home to find that it just got stuck again and again.I hope that the technology can be refined, but for now this product is not a useful tool. If you have a completely flat floor without any rugs it could work but that still is not a sure thing. Think carefully before purchasing this product. I had to return mine and I'm still waiting for the next generation robot vacuums that are more reliable."
2,Prog Metal,This is one of the best prog metal albums of the 70's. This is one of those heavy rock records that you must own to be a fan of heavy metal. Kansas rocks hard. The electric violin kicks arse! Kansas was the only heavy metal band with a violinist! This album is rock with feeling and emotion. This is one of those records were you wonder if the band are humans or gods. Classic.
1,Found it not as good as I hoped,By far this is not the best CD I have heard on this topic. I think that too many intruptions when intoducing each speaker. And the accent of the author I found to be very distracting. I do not recommens this
1,*** Seeds are no where near 200 QTY !!!!,"The item is no were near 200 seeds. Using standard planting directions, they simple do not grow well (in-door during germination). Definitely would not recommend to any buyer."
1,Motorola Li-Ion Extended Battery and Door for Motorola KRZR (Dark Pearl Gray),I ordered this product from OEM. I never recieved the product I ordered. OEM did try and make this right by convincing me to take my review down and sending me out another back to the battery. But they sent me out the exact same back that went to a NEXTEL phone not a KRZR. I still have not recieved the correct back and have no way to use a battery with no back that fits. I have no idea how the battery works or doesn't work. I would NEVER order from OEM and if you do and they screw up your order don't take down your review until you actually have the correct item in hand. In my opinion OEM is a joke.
1,pure filth,"Being English, the author has no understanding of American ideas about liberty and self reliance. The book is unappologetic propaganda with no attempt to understand how or why firearms save millions of lives. If you believe that guns are evil, with the capacity to turn otherwise normal people into raving lunatics or that the American people are just too stupid to be trusted with firearms but can operate motor vehicles and aircraft just fine, well this book will confirm what you already believe. If you are capable of using logic and separating fact from emotional hyperbole you may very well vomit."
1,Can't watch it on the ipod,So disappointed! And I spent $30 at the only store where I could buy it immediately in Japan. My kids have already asked me to put it on the ipod. :( What a waste this ultraviolet is.
2,THESE EPISODES CAPTIVATE YOUR TOTAL ATTENTION....and then some! WONDERFUL!! I LOVE IT!,IF YOU LOVE ANY SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES....THIS WHOLE COMPLETE SERIES IS THE WAY TO GO! THE ACTING BY JEREMY BRETT IS SUPERB AND WELL DONE. HIS GENIUS DRAMATIC WAY OF PLAYING THE PART OF SHERLOCK HOLMES IS MAGNIFICENT! I COMPLETELY RECOMMEND THIS COLLECTION. ITS AWESOME! LOVE IT! I LOVE AMAZON.
2,Very functional and good features for the price,"Though my 4 year old doesn't use it as often as I would like, this is one good watch.Lots of features for the price and pretty solid too."
2,awesome show!,awesome show. it's so cute and my kids love it. always a has a great moral in each episode and we're Irish and LOVE the seting and brogues!!!
2,Snack or meal replacement,"These are great tasting and not full of preservatives. You have to like raw taste to eat these, but they are a LOT better than most things a person can eat. They are just a little greasy tasting..."
2,Turbojam DVD Review,"The product was exactly what I was expecting, a very good price for what it contains, and came in a timely manner. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
2,Holy Crap!!!!!!!!,"I bought the Large anal plug and i thought i had some experience and it wouldnt be that bad. when i opened this thing, it looked large but not to bad. so i tried inserting it, and well, no luck haha, i had to sit on it and for an hour i tried to get it in. IT HURT! im still trying to get it in after 4 days of stretching! but each day i try i can feel it go in a bit more. but seriously only get this if you are up for the challenge or if your experienced! It hurts to walk right now! I feel it was a very good purchase because its the challenge that is fun for me and the part i can get in slides right in! i would recommend this toy because it feels great without even getting all the way in and i love trying to use it haha id recommend also buying the smaller one so if you cant get it in so you can still have something in while taking a break!! hah I LOVE IT!!"
2,Electric Blower/Vacuum,"The vacuum / blower works great however after the bag starts to fill up it gets very uncomfortable to carry, the weiget seems to go right to the small of the back."
2,they loved it.,"me and my fiance purchased this for my soon to be inlaws and it was a perfect gift. they couldnt wait to rip it out of the box and use it. they plugged it in, stuck a memory card from one of their digital cameras in the slot... and viola! it worked. it was sooo simple. the picture is amazing. the color is great. and i think you can add music to your slideshow. they loved it. as did we. i think me and my fiance are going to get one for ourselves.this is a great gift for anyone who is hard to shop for, or for that person that has everything. i mean.... who doesnt like good memories?:D"
1,An interesting but shallow read,"It is the year 2030 in this novel, and oil has become much scarcer and more expensive. John Grant may have come up with a solution to the energy crises, and he is a part of a complicated plot that skips around a lot and is hard to follow at times. There is war in the Middle East (what's new!), and this war does spread, a picture of a not rosy future.I found that Bart Kosko did not do very well in character development and also did poorly in describing places and scenery. It seems this novel should have been longer to flesh it out.In this book you will read about mind transfers to computer chips, artificial wombs, nanotechnology, and other technology about thirty years down the road, and all of this was done in a satisfactory way, but there is a lot more better science fiction out there to read, unless of course the subject matter of this book should interest you."
2,I saw them live...,"and i can honestly say ive never seen a preformer antagonize the audience as much as the singer of The Kinison. He was annoying, whined about the audience's reaction, and was giving everyone the finger. I dont think im alone when i say that i truly wanted to punch this kid in the face. What really got me was that amidst this skinny bugg-eyed jerk being *this* close to getting his @ss handed to him by the collective audience, The Kinison WERE ROCKING. I was confused. Livid. I wanted to kill this guy. I liked the music. what was going on?decide for yourself."
2,"Buti si, Bocelli no","While Bocelli is clearly up way past his bedtime when he tries to sing opera (his strained efforts make me uncomfortable, his voice has one bland color, and he has little to say as an interpreter), I used to concede that he was a decent interpreter of Italian songs. But that was before I renewed my acquaintence with Buti.Buti's ease of production, his even registers, his wonderful muscianship, and his sensitivity make him a master of this genre. And he's not the only one. Seek out Francesco Albanese, Raoul Romito and Francesco Daddi.If Bocelli were not handsome, were not a romantic figure for the obstacle he had to overcome, and were he not pimped by a major record lable, he'd be singing for tips in Piazza Novona and not attracting much attention. (Excuse my using Bocelli as a reference point, but it is certainly one we are all familiar with - ad nauseam)"
1,Amazing !,"As European, I read this book with interest. Democraty depends on the amount of voters and their ideas. As soon as the Muslims will replace the other polulations with their larger breeding, they democratically will impose their 7th century way of life."
1,Mowat Cried Wolf,"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under ""Comedy"" if not ""Fiction"". Putting it under an ""Ecological Essay"" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing ""ecological"" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies."
2,Amazing Pedals,"Well, these pedals, are just great for the games. They just fit on your feet, you can change the sizes, it has a sensibility controller. The product is just amazing. Coming with the Saitek Software CD makes a great experience."
1,Overrated and saggy after short use,"The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you. I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support. This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well.The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags. I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape.Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine. While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros.The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk!"
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the first reviewer. Papa has so much promise on DVD. His voice and personality shine during his live performances and on CDs. He is simply incredible. This DVD, however, disappoints almost completely. Its only high spots are the few professionally made music videos in the extras section. The main concert footage is energetic, but generally raw, disorganized and the sound quality is abysmal. Papa, take a look at Baaba Maal or Youssou N'Dour to see and hear how professional video makers ply their craft. You can do it Papa. We're all waiting and will support you."
2,How much to ship to Iran?,Anybody think the Iranian govt might be satisfied with this stuff if we sent them a bunch of it? I'd be willing to chip in a can worth for the sake of world peace.
2,A Refreshing Change in the Music Scene,"In a world dominated by pop stars like Brittney Spears, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys it is refreshing to hear someone with a whole new twist on new music. Soulful, reminicent and somewhat vintage, this CD is bound to have you wanting more like it. Besides the CD's singles such as; The Way I Feel, Take a Message, and Rocksteady this CD has 8 other soulful tracks and catchy tunes. Here's hoping we'll be hearing more soon....."
2,Love it,"I had been searching for a jogging stroller wit a swivel wheel that was easy to push and comfortable for my son. He loves it. Have used it to walk the older children to and from school, in the mall, around the neighborhood ( goes up and down curbs without disturbing the walking pace or passenger.) We are taking it to Disney next week."
2,All about flowers,"A well written, info packed introduction to flowers. Nice detail about the plant life cycle. For example, ""a circle of stamens grows around the stigma. Each stamen holds a pollen sac called an anther."" The photos are clear and labeled and the book design is very colorful. There is one activity (food color/water/carnations). One page shows examples of flowering and non-flowering plants. There is a glossary and index. Karen Woodworth Roman, MS, Children's Science Book Review"
2,Super fun but not too durable,"This Diego Rescue Center is very fun for my kids to play with. My 2 1/2 and 4 year old love it. They play rescue adventures and I love the imaginative play that comes with this house. The only problem I have is that it's not very durable. It's wobbles on it's ""stilts"" that attach it to the base and the top floor (the part that folds out) falls off all the time. I probably have to put it on 5 times everytime they play with it. I really don't think they are being too rough - they just lean on the floor while they are playing with it and it pops off. I'm afraid it will eventually break - it's held on with only 2 tabs - and with the constant popping off I'm sure one or both of the tabs will eventually give.Overall, I think it's a fun toy with lots of replay value. But I wish it was a bit more kid-friendly on the durability side - especially for the money."
2,Perfect fit,"My hair is not very ""long"" but I usually wear it in a bun and this cap fit over it perfectly."
2,Great Sound Quality,"I boughtSoothing Sounds for SleepCD because my son is a very light sleeper. He would wake up to the slightest little noise. I turn up the volume to the Highway Hum, put it on repeat, and he sleeps through the phone ringing, people talking, even the doorbell!All of the sounds are very realistic sounding. this CD could even be used for older children or adults that need help staying asleep! Very soothing!"
1,Nothing but problems...,"I bought this player in January, and have been able to use it less than 10 times. I have had to fix problems everytime I try to put new songs on. I have had to send it back twice--for the same problem! The second time Samsung said they would send me a new player--a week later I was sent my old one that they said they couldn't fix. Now when I call to find out what is going on, customer service says sorry, nothing we can do...be warned if you buy this player, you may not actually get to use it, nor is Samsung very helpful."
1,an appointment with disappointment,"I've been collecting house music for over a decade now. I own tracks from Genesis P. to Carl Cox and everything in between. And just as any avid music collector, there are times when you by an album with the hope of finding the next phat groove for your audio enjoyment. I cannot relay my disappointment when I picked up this CD.The tracks never really seem to take hold. It borderlines monotonous at times. I love phat DC, Philly, Chicago house. But this lack of feeling and over all vibe, if you will, was a stark contrast to everything I love about house. I've heard GV's tracks on many other compilations and each sounded promising.Since my initial time of purchase, I've only listened to it 4 or 5 times, just to be sure my tastes haven't changed and my ears haven't deceived me. But alas, it sits among the rest, out of my personal rotation, collecting dust.Perhaps another listen is now in order."
1,I second the last comment,I knew it was too good to be true but these false sellers are taking up space on this website.
1,hard to read,"i was expecting this to be a motivational book to get me going, well all it did for me was help me sleep cause it bored me to death, i'll never try reading for motivation again i'll stick with my music"
1,Terrible....,Brand new out of the package....big piece of junk. Wasted my time and effort. Not a happy camper. Where is the quality assurance and vendor integrity??
1,sync software will wipe out contacts on your computer,"The phone is reasonably good, assuming you don't mind it crashing once or twice per day. If you need to sync with Microsoft Outlook, however, you need to buy software separately for about $40. It will take an hour or so to download. After a couple of syncs, you will find that a lot of information has been lost on your computer. The phone, for example, cannot deal with a contact that has just a business name and no person's name. First the contacts show up as headless zombies on the phone. Then the company name gets wiped out from Outlook on your computer."
1,"AWKWARD STYLE, NO EDITING","This book needs an editor. The stream-of-consciousness thoughts are not blended well with the dialog or action.Even worse are the sentence fragments. This book is written. In a very awkward. Writing style. A lot of. Incomplete sentences. And word phrases.Not much of a story, either."
1,Some good...some bad,"Bought this set as it was the ""platinum"" set. Thought it would be a good one. Right out of the gate, the birdie was getting stuck in the strings of the raquets on every 3rd or 4th hit. That was extremely frustrating and caused us to quit playing shortly after starting. On a positive note, the net and volleyball seem to be of good quality and the set up was pretty easy. Ultimately...we'd use it for badminton the most and with the raquet strings being so loose that you can't play with them, the set is very disappointing. Would love to send it back, but can't find my receipt."
2,Breathtaking,"""Hero"" is a wonderful album that all can enjoy. It is a masterpiece from start to finish. Kirk even includes his children as one son beat boxes for his father and the other one delivers spoken word on the outro. Kirk is sentimental and tremendously personal on ""Let It Go"", and he is also really inspirational on ""Imagine Me"" (My favorite song on the album). Then artists such as the marvelous Stevie Wonder, J Moss, Yolanda Adams, Tye Tribbitt, and Dorinda Clark-Cole grace this album with their presence. After listening to this album, I have to say that it is one of the best albums of all time (regardless of genre). Therefore, you should not miss out on this amazing experience."
2,Best PS2 Game Ever!,"Bratz Rock Angels is so awesome! You get to pick out fashions while still doing something adventorous. You get to go around the world and try to make the best magazine on the market, better than your rival, Burdine's, magazine. The only thing bad about this game was that it ended really soon! I hope they come out with a new one!"
2,Just what we were looking for,We have this humidifier and cannot purchase the filters any where in town. This was the best deal that i was able to find on them. They were exactly what we needed.
2,A Claustrophobic Depiction of the Life of U-Boat Submariners,Madness drips like salty water squeezed from the creaking seams of the U-Boat death traps this gripping narrative describes in all-too vivid detail. The author takes you where few can imagine going...and lets you feel the crushing hammers of depth charges and the suffocating terror of impending death. If you want a glimpse into the reality of U-Boat life...or the insanity of war...this is the book. I couldn't put it down.
1,m5 is better,"the m5 has better software, and processes quickly, espcially during a wrong turns. The touch pad feature is nice, too bad the m5 doesn't have it. Just not a good product."
2,There just isn't music made like this anymore,"There is so much texture and complexity on this Rush album, it's hard to find a place to start. In my opinion, the band has given up since this album. Not that post-Presto Rush albums are bad, they just do not have the masterful song writing and lyrics that Presto has. There are 3 stand-out tracks, ""The Pass"" is one of the best Rush songs of all time. ""Available light"" is the sleeper on the album, a pure gem buried as the as the track on the album (ala ""Between the Wheels"") and ""Hand Over Fist"" a powerful, well crafted song. I didn't even mention Show don't tell, which has one of the most amazing bass lines of any Rush song. A true classic."
2,Deadly Revenge,"Deadly Revenge is a very good mystery. The characters were believable and well developed. The plot was carried along very well through out the entire book. The action was described very well. This is a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone.The only flaw I found was some errors in punctuation and captilization,which could have occured when the publisher converted the manuscript to their print program. I have recommended this author to others who are avid readers."
2,Great show! Probably As Good As We'll Ever Get On DVD,"NBC-Universal actually licensed this show to Timeless Media Group for this DVD release. As someone has already mentioned, the transfers are from high-contrast 16mm prints. Trash, dirt, and lines are everywhere in places. The sound isn't that great, either.Even given those problems, this is a set worth owning--particularly if you can get it as cheaply as possible. Universal apparently had no plans to release this themselves, so I'm sure this is probably it for a DVD release. It is certainly watchable, and this is a prime example of how the studios ""spoil us"" with their own releases in terms of cleanup and presentation."
1,EMPTY TOMB,"This is the 2nd FRIGHTFEST I've seen out of the 8, and I hope the other 6 are better.Loosely based on Poe's somber poem, THE TOMB is snail-paced, predictable with surprisingly poor performances from Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen.Not frightening at all and dull as dishwater."
1,BUY ONLY IF YOU ENJOY LOSING MONEY,"Everything worked great for five weeks until the stupid thing just stopped working in the middle of a song. I have never dropped it or overused it. I took great care of it, only using for 1-2 hours a day during my commute. I have not been able to turn it on since. It's totally dead. I contacted the manufacturer (after several calls and e-mails), and they sent me back to Amazon for a refund. They said, ""Not our problem; you didn't buy from us. Contact Amazon."" This product is #2 human waste in disguise. Buy it only if you enjoy throwing your money away."
2,Worth it's weight in GOLD!,"This swing has been a life saver! I've bought 2 different swings for my grandson, who is nearly 3 months old now. I love them both, but this one is amazing, since it does NOT take batteries! Highly Recommend!"
1,This work obfuscates the true essence of taichi.,"The author purportedly wanted to explore the martial applications of tai chi chuan; however, his understanding of the subject matter appears to be inadequate. In the most crucial areas, his explanations are often obscure, and worse, incorrect. This is a good book if you want to pick up some rudimentary ideas about the vocabulary of higher levels of tai chi, but it does not get to the true essence of the well guarded secrets of tai chi as a powerful martial art."
1,Life is nice in England,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it showed me the music in American cities that we only read about in Melody Maker and Rolling Stone. I was mighty impressed that Peter Frampton helped to keep the '70's music sound real and Still Water lived the dream. Kate Hudson is a babe but most of all life on the road in the States was much as I imagined. How good that some one recreated the Riot House I now think I've been there. We had our top rock venues here in Manchester(and still do) but this film captures the magic of a musical generation that no one appears to be able to compete with anymore. If you want to relive a suerb piece of magic in your life buy this I did and get a bottle of beer a neat girl by yourside and some thing that resembles a ciggerette and dream"
1,"I ordered this and got the new version, which is USELESS","This is the only liquid bandaid that is worth buying. I've tried others that smell and feel like nail polish and strip off in a minutes. This one is invisible, stays put...is simply excellent. The catch - I think it's discontinued and when I ordered it from here the last time I got the wrong product, which is the individually wrapped pre-soaked sticks that are a total waste of money and time. Others had posted the same thing, but for some reason those reviews have disappeared from the site. Worse part, you cannot return it because it is a medical-related product."
1,He's Craaaaazy!,"Kevin Trudeau's Weight Loss Cure is great bathroom-reading material. I found it to be an easy read, but would not personally subscribe to the ""cure"", which I consider to be such drastic measures."
1,Lacie's are BAD NEWS,I had a 500Gig crash on me within a year. I bought this 250 as a replacement. Out of the box it was unfunctional and made the weirdest sounds I've ever heard. I sent it to Lacie and they sent it back to me no different. I'm not using Lacie anymore - too much is at stake. I loved the way they looked and stacked but I'm WAY OVER it. Lacie no more.
1,Another Waste of Innocent Trees,"I ordered this along woth ""Start Late, Finish Rich"" by the same author. All the info and quizzes in here can be obtained free online from any competent investment firm or bank. I also returned this book."
1,4th No More?,"Loved ""1st to Die"". Liked ""2nd Chance."" Hated ""3rd Degree."" Is it because this ""Andrew Gross"" person might have wrote it??? If you read ""1st to Die"" and immediately ""3rd degree"" afterwards, you would not believe that the same person wrote the two books. ""3rd Degree"" shouldn't even be part of the ""Women's Murder Club"" series since only one of the 4 characters has a major role and he kills one of them off. Perhaps if James Patterson writes the 4th novel in the series (without Andrew Gross), I might be interested to read it. Otherwise, I'll pass on this series."
1,Also Contains ZINC,"The description does not tell you that this product also contains ZINC. If your like me and cannot have anything ""extra"" in your pedialyte, this caused me to buy an entire case that I cannot use. If your going to add ZINC, then at least put it in the description."
2,For new cable hook,"Excellent material and fits perfect to the thimble of my new synthetic cable, maybe for what I'm using it (atv mudding) can be a little big but works great."
2,Awesome You can feel Donnie's love for the Lord in each song,"This CD was Awesome, it is truly ordained by the Lord. You could actually feel the presence of the Lord as Donnie sings. Donnie's love for the Lord is evident in every word that he sings."
1,Fone Failure,"I have owned this phone for a few years, and it worked well, but then the battery started failing to charge. I replaced the battery only to discover that the new battery would not charge either. The light on the base flickers, just as with other people's descriptions. Ultimately these cheap Chinese made phones are a waste of your money"
1,Cheaper for a reason,"Dr.Natura is more expensive but MUCH higher quality. This stuff was like stirring sand, never mixed with the water, just sat in the bottom of the cup. I was able to gag one serving down before I threw this crap away."
1,Rubbish,"This chill mat is absolute rubbish. The plastic fan guard is what the laptop weight focuses on unless you have the cheap plastic stand flicked down. The guard will quickly deform to interfere with fan operation, leading to heating of the fan motor , heating the air which is subsequently blown in to the laptop. Who puts the fan inlet on the bottom of something designed to sit on your lap or a flat surface, just dumb. You cannot use your laptop on your lap with this piece of junk. The ergonomics are awkward. It is just junk, but luckily you won't have it around long as it wears out after a month or two. The Antec is better"
2,"Great choice of guitar players, choice of licks disappointing","This book as others of Dave Rubin covers some great ""unsung"" guitar players contains essays and biograpic data and also some rare photos - in many cases material i have not found anywhere else. Thats why i as a fan and also collector of books about my favourite music dont regret buying.Unfortunately the choice of the material that is tabbed out is somewhat disappointing. Very short, about three pages or less on each player and IMO not really essential licks but rather mediocre.A wasted chance to make a great book."
2,Still Got It!,"Boston Legal - William Shatner at his best, especially Season One! This is the one that gets you hooked!"
2,The Royal Road to Card Magic,"If you are looking for the easy and no effort method to card magic, this is definately not the book for you. HOWEVER, in conjuction with the DVD set with the same title, then, with a little to a lot of effort, you will be turning out card tricks that will sometimes amaze yourself, even while you are doing them!By itself, the book's graphics are somewhat difficult to discern. But careful reading of the text resolves most of these issues.Again, what makes this book so very good is the DVD. They enhance each other so that understanding each process is very easy.Good Luck."
2,Great resource,This is a great resource for any horse owner. very detailed and informative without being product oriented.
2,Prancer,Excellent Movie my daughter wanted for Christmas at a affordable price.It is a movie she remembers as a child and wanted it as part to start building herown Christmas Movie Collection. :) Came safely packaged and in great condition.
2,quite smooth and reliable,"I have been using the 6824N for a few months now. I must say it is quite reliable and not as noisy as other screwguns. It saves a lot of time. I can fill a 4x12 sheet in about 2 minutes. It is so much faster than using a regular screwdriver. It is very smooth and sets the screws perfectly each time. It is ergonomically well designed, being well balanced in the hand."
1,hoover flair power head vacuum,great for vacuuming floors and rugs I've had 2. The first one the brush stopped working after 11/2 years. Thaught it was a bad vacuum so I purchased a second one the brush stopped working after 1 1/2 years .Needless to say I do not recommend this stick vacuum.
1,"Somewhat funny, but doesn't cut it.","Getting In is an... interesting film, but after a while it becomes a dismal bore. Some parts of the film are funny, but usually it is pretty lame, and doesn't REALLY make the murderer a mystery. In ""Getting In"", Medical Students are mysteriously killed after being bribed off of the waiting list into Johns Hopkins Medical School. It's a little humorous and interesting at times, but other than that, it's a bore. And DON'T let the photos of Calista Flockhart and Matthew Perry on the cover of the film's recent re-release fool you... they have a total of 6 minutes airtime together, and I am not kidding."
1,Caution! Read this before using quinine for leg cramps.,"My mother had been taking these and I finally got around to researching it. Please read the links below, including a press release from the FDA, and decide for yourself if the risk outweighs the benefits.http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01521.htmlhttp://www.resource4thepeople.com/defectivedrugs/quinine.html"
2,FANTASTIC!,The book came earlier than I expected. It was exacty what I ordered and could not be more satsified. I would recommend this seller to other people any day.
1,"Most of the CD was okay, but...","There were noticeable mistakes in the Pianists movement of ""Carnival of the Animals"". Really, really noticeable mistakes. That shouldn't happen in a piece that consists entirely of major scales."
1,Anemic and incorrect,"From having played professionally for many years, this little guide has some very serious mistakes on the care and filing of the fingernails. This is most detrimental to the welfare of the playing of a nylon string guitar, for anyone who evers wants to play well."
2,The best gift for any bookworm,"I know this is the older model of the kindle, and there are so many newer models that are out now, but this one is working just fine. I was hesitant to try and convert my husband to a book reader of any kind, and took a chance. He's had this for a few years now and loves it. He said this was the best gift ever. He has no desire to upgrade with the newer models that have come out at this time."
1,bennett,"Not really very good, I guess I am use to hearing Tony when he was younger - he lost his range of sound"
2,5 stars ain't enuff....,"to justify Saul's lyrical mastery. This book is to be studied and savored like Mama's sweet potato pie with whipped cream. Buy this, read this then buy ""She"" to see the evolution of a poet. peace"
2,Beautiful quality belt.,"As in most things, not just clothing, you generally get what you pay for. This belt is stunning and well made. The look, quality and construction make my Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren belts pale by comparison. I bought both the Merlot and Black versions to pair with the same color AE Park Avenue Oxfords. Excellent business attire combo for any executive. Highly recommended."
1,Not a well-made bike trailer,"I usually assume that anything made by Little Tikes will last. This is not the case with this product. A small rubber rod which attaches the stroller to the bike snapped in half. In my opinion, a part which attaches a trailer (with my child inside) to my bike should be virtually indestructible. I called Little Tikes, and was told that no replacement parts are stocked for this product. Since I purchased over a year ago, there is no warranty, and I was told to throw away the bike stroller. I am extremely unhappy about this."
1,This is silly.,"Mad About You is a fine tv programme... I'm English and happened to catch an episode on freeview by accident and was completely hooked by the sharp script, witty set-ups and general easy raport between the two fantastic leads, Helen Hunt and the fantastic Paul Reiser.It shows how great the show is that I am willing to wade through this unfamiliar American website to see if I can buy all the series... and I am appalled by this so-called ""Best Of"". There seems to be very little in the way of extras on the first two releases, and I refuse to be conned by the studio into shelling out the extra cash for this.It's almost as though the studio is using the love dedicated fans of Mad About You feel for the programme. Shame on you!"
2,A Shock to the System,"Well, I just read other reviews on this book - and my initial response is, why read a book that obviously isn't your cup of tea? Yes it is gory but that's this particular reader's preference. Sure it is ugly and I read to be shocked. And I was. I found it took me a little while to get into this book, hence my decision to give it 4 stars. However, once the author had grabbed my attention, she had it - I couldn't put the damn thing down! Halfway through, a major plot change happened and left me thinking ""What the heck?"" and I couldn't wait to finish it. I loved this book. I gave it to a friend of mine - and she too has the same opinion. If you want background and thorough reasoning to why killers kill - keep with true crime, if you want a great fast-paced interesting fiction story about killing, then this is it. I can't wait to read another of this author's works."
2,Nordic cool. . .,"Lyric, melodic, hypnotic, definitely cool jazz. The cuts on this 66-minute CD are like chilled vodka over ice, way, way after midnight.The opening tracks, ""Deep as Love"" and ""Graceful Touch,"" are aptly titled, both leisurely and tense, seeming to willfully resist movement forward, keeping the lid on, as fingers lightly touch keys and strings and then break out in brief releases of strength, which are quickly contained again. You listen, rapt.Nervous energy surfaces more urgently in the following ""IGN,"" and then we are back in the lingeringly cool groove with ""Melted Matter,"" breaking out at moments in the following ""At a Glance,"" which ends again quietly.And so it goes. This is a wonderful CD for lights-low, after hours listening. The booklet that comes with it has portrait shots of the trio: Tord Gustavsen (piano), Harald Johnsen (double-bass), and Jarle Vespestad (drums). Recorded in Oslo."
1,Needs expert peer review,"Be carefull relying on only this book for studying, I have found errors both factual and typing in mainly (but not limited to) the Review Questions sections."
2,Inspiration without pretention,"I'm down eleven pounds, eating healthier and I might even be a bit more outgoing. This little book is full of practical tips to improve your life painlessly. I found numerous ideas that have helped me address issues that had previously seemed too big to confront. Larry and Susan present their ideas like good friends who want to take you under their wing and help you do what you know you should but never had the ambition to attempt. Their bite-size approach to change makes it far more palatable. Make a small change in your life right now and buy the book. It'll help you out far more than that fast food lunch you would have bought with the money."
1,It lasted 3 months,"I liked the convenience of this stroller, the size and side by side option, HOWEVER, it did not stand up to everyday use. (note that it did not come with instructions) The front brakes no longer work so the only way I can get it to move is by pulling it. It has bends in several places and no longer folds properly. This is from only getting my 20lb and 30lb children and getting it in and out of the car, also 1 airplane ride. I am disappointed in the quality. I paid $250 and feel like I wasted my money."
1,Inaccurate outdoor temperature reading,"Looks nice, easy to mount. Overpriced and outside reading is affected by heat inside the house radiating through the window pane."
1,Poorly made,"I SO wanted to love this blender. I make smoothies and salsa daily and replaced the Tribest with another personal blender. Initially, I was very impressed with the sharpness of the blades and the ease of how well everything blended. This blender, however did not last long, I assumed I had done something wrong and purchased another. The new one worked for only three weeks when things started to fall apart. Over the next 4 months I had multiple parts replaced (I will say the customer service was good and quick to send replacement parts). I followed the directions meticulously (not blending more than 60sec ect), however in less than one year the thing fell apart again. I will NOT purchase this one again, am going back to the Magic Bullet. If you buy this KEEP THE WARRANTY."
1,"Bought one, it wouldn't work, got it replaced. which also didn't work.","I was hoping to put together a computer as a christmas present for a friend but BOTH motherboards i got where broken, wouldn't power up at all forcing me to return all the parts I got on amazon because they're useless to me and it will probably cause controversy. Hopefully i get my $155 back without any problems."
2,Excellent... A Very Eclectic and Intelligent Book,"Turkel's book combines the best of her research in psychoanalysis, computer technology, and sociology. A readable and thought-provoking work for academics and general public. Timely subject-matter, with a po-mo focus that will make it interesting even in a few years when the technological references will be dated. Somewhat over-emphasizing the Usenet and MUD elements of Internet, with less on the World Wide Web. Highly recommended for those interested in exploring philosophical questions related to ""being"" in the computer age"
2,Schwinn Elliptical,Product works well. Careful not to tighten the screws too tightly on the swinging arm and leg bars. The machine will squeak loudly if you do.
2,Gospel Store owner,"As a store owner i will love to sell this product in my store, if i can get this product or any thing by Juanita, my customers in Trinidad & Tobago will be very happy .At presant there are no distributor for the people of the Caribean.Please to Management give me wholesale prizes and i will bless the hearts through the ministry of Juanita Bynum. Thank you and God bless you richly. Please e-mail me or give me a call at #868-653-8560"
1,High price - short life - poor value.,High price for a heating pad that lasted 18 months.The thermostat would fluctuate temperature between cold and very hot even when new.One day it just stopped - digital display still worked but no heat.
2,Sony Headphones,"I purchased these headphones to use while working out. Rather than crank the TV so loudly while running on my treadmill or using the elliptical, I thought this may be a good alternative. So far I've had no problems. I place them on the charger after each use so I havn't had an issue with battery life. The sound isn't crystal clear but I'm also moving around quite a bit. They work well for what I bought them for and for the price feel it was a good purchase."
1,Two stroke penalty,I expected various tips on the practice range. But the author uses only 18 out of 179 pages for range tips. The rest of the book is for ordinary swing instructions and 'faults and fixes' with real people.There are a lot of good books on golf swing; I don't want to know anything about Seattle golfers particularly. I already have David Leadbetter's 'Faults and Fixes' and it's a good book. The author of 'Home on the Range' didn't have focus on his title.
1,Buyer Beware!,I have ordered this CD new directly from Amazon twice now and both times the 2nd cd does not work at all. Very disappointed!!! 2 stars because I did like the one cd that worked but will be returning it since I didn't get the full value for the price. Did I mention how upset I am at the hassle and still not receiving a fully functioning copy of a much anticipated purchase? Do not buy until this issue is rectified!
2,"Easy to use, plastic could be higher quality","We purchased the Hunter 44550 a month ago to replace one of the old round non-digital thermostats and the Hunter has been very easy to use. The installation was fairly easy; I encountered a slight problem because the thermostat I was replacing did not have the wires labeled. Fortunately the Hunter installation manual had some wiring diagrams in the appendix and I was able to figure it out. Programming the thermostat is very easy - much easier than another ""H-brand"" digital thermostat that we have in our house. The one down side to the Hunter unit is the quality of the backing plate that mounts to the wall. The plate flexes more than it probably should, hence I am only rating it 4-stars. The thermostat we have from the other ""H-brand"" seems sturdier, but not as easy to program. Minor gripe aside, I would buy this Hunter thermostat again (and I plan to because we have one more thermostat to replace)."
2,Another fine Olympus product,"Camera specs are excellent for the price, I have an older very good E10, and Olympus has improved many things with this model, much lighter too. I was looking for a camera with image stabilization in the body of the camera, the sonic wave filter (like the E10) and one that had interchangable lenses. I like the larger CF memory (so I can't lose it as easily), plus they are available with more capacity than SD cards. I was hoping to re-use my FL40 flash but now I have to save for the newer FL50 to work with the 510. I also was a little dissapointed in the small veiwfinder, but the LCD screen is now much larger. The scene modes have nice explanations built in and will be useful and the program modes can be customized and stored."
2,Excellent book on Yorkies,"This is a must have book if you are owned by a Yorkshire Terrier, or if you are planning on becoming a Yorkie's subject. They think they are royalty, you know. It provides all the needed information."
2,What I wanted,I bought a couple for my boys and they were easy to install and have worked beautifully. I'd buy them for myself if I didn't already have others.
2,12 month live,"Fast and easy way to purchase 12 month live membership. Cheap too! I would recommend it to everyone, no hassle, you get the code right away."
1,Couldn't even finish the movie...,"Not quite sure what direction they wanted to take with this movie. It was a love story/drama/action flick and all around cheesy film. The story itself doesn't come clear until about 30 minutes into the movie. By then, i was totally uninterested. Concept is simple. We (humans) beam messages into outer space. Eventually they get an answer. From there, it's pretty cut and dry. Hostile aliens, etc., etc. Even though they had some decent action and good actors like Liam Neesen, they still couldn't save this sinking ship. And Rhianna's role was laughable at best. Overall grade is D-. Rent it if you must see it. Not worth a buy. Glad i didn't see this debacle in the theaters. I would have walked out. I couldn't even finish this film. I stopped watching at the hour and half mark and fast forwarded some parts at that. I had enough of it."
2,'A Deadly Dose Of Wylde Psych' (Arf! Arf!) Various Artists,"Third CD compilation of a similar sort that the independent label Arf! Arf! put out awhile back. Twenty-six tracks of super-obscure U.S. / UK psychedelic bands. After listening to this disc the first time, you'll likely think to yourself - JUST by chance at least a few of these groups really should've had a major hit. Bands I liked the most include Finch, Peacepipe, Pawnbroker, Oscar Hamod (reminds me of Electric Prunes), the awesome Wet Paint (looks to have several CD's out) and the soulful Wildwood. A couple of other bands here worth mentioning are The Attack (John DuCann was in this band a short time), Limefrost and Tea Company with their out-of-this-world cut ""Come And Have Some Tea With Me"". Highly recommended."
1,Left bumps,"I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this product and was hoping for the same results. This is my first review on amazon, which should tell you how bad this is. I can use almond oil, olive oil, and a number of other oils....but this one left bumps on my skin. It was smoothing or moisturizing like other people said in their reviews. If you have dry, sensitive skin like me, I'd go with another oil."
2,BEST BOOK I HAVE READ. PERIOD.,"I will not make this long & drawn out. My simple review is this. If you enjoy reading not a good book, but a GREAT book.....READ THIS BOOK. I just loved it and have been cleaning out book sellers copies to send & give to friends. Thank you Gwendolyn Bounds for one fantastic journey.David RogowayLake Oswego, Oregon"
2,Not Your Mother's Freud,"If you're a fan of dramatic art, ripping fast cars packed to the gunwales with gleaming blue steel and gleamier women, get this book. As a feminist, I hate it. As an artist, I'm an addict.This is why I have a therapist. Go get your own.The dedication:""What do I ask of a painting? I ask it to astonish, disturb, seduce, convince."" ~ Lucien Freud.This is NOT your mother's Freud."
1,"A great movie, a not so great soundtrack.","This is one of those soundtracks that doesn't capture the feeling of the movie. The music is quite non-descript and annoying at times. Except for a few tracks, I was quite disappointed. Watch and movie and enjoy, but leave it at that. You'll be glad you saved your money."
1,Worst fantasy novel I have ever tried to read.,"I have read hundreds of novels whose authors include Tolkien, Feist, Hobb, Salvatore, Marco, Jordan and Goodkind just to name a few. This was by far the worst fantasy novel I have ever tried to read. The author's writing style is bad enough to decypher, and add that to the tedious story line makes for the most boring read I have read in a very long time.I got to page 333 and even though stuck in an airport with hours before my flight, I had to put it down and go buy some magazines. If it were a horse I would have had to shoot it. Those of you who read fantasy as I do to ""get away"" from the daily grind, don't waste your time on this."
2,Excellent money saver!,Bought and installed three of these for the bathroom exhaust fans in the house. This particular model is for exhaust fans in particular. They have a lower amp model for lighting. Works great and installation was a breeze. Finally the fan is shut off automatically. I bought this unit over other manufacturer offerings because it has a button for each of the time increments. Other manufacturers models had a single button requiring you to press it multiple times to get the desired duration.
1,too expensive,too expensive for this skinny little book I saw this book in the footnotes of a really good talk so decided to order it. I will use it because I paid so much for it ... regretfully
2,Good Motorola battery,"It's a good battery but not the best one. Remember this batt has 820 mAh and could perform with a normal, regular period of talking time in your phone but if you want to improve it you would get to try the BK series for more mAh."
1,"yes, he's a handsome vampire","Title says it all... and that's what 60% of the book is about.The vampire is handsome.And just in case we didn't mention it, the vampire is handsome.Oh... let's throw in some action at the end to kinda-sorta have a story...Please don't hate me, I read the book, I just didn't like it so much.In an ironic twist, the movie was better."
1,This is not sweet at all.,"Sugar Sweet??? This film bored me to sleep. Just happy I did not buy it. The film tries to be sexy tries to be well acted and is neither. Just because it is a lesbian movie, did not make it good, and that is from a lesbian reviewer. Why there are few great lesbian films, I have not a clue. If you need to see a great lesbian film go buy A Family Affair, Lianna, Desert Hearts,Aimee and Jaguar, or even The Killing of Sister George(for old classic film value) ...but forget Sugar sweet...it is sour"
1,Not Recommended if you are looking for real help,"Feels like a slapped together attempt to make some money. No survey review. Most of the reviews are very confusing. The hydrology review is just a couple questions with manning's and Hazen equations. The review questions don't have real explained solutions. Don't waste time with this book, find something else."
2,"intense, mellow, and quietly acoustic","Doiron sounds like a young Cat Power or Scout Niblett with more stripped down, heartfelt pop tunes. Her vocals are downcast and somewhat repetitive over the whole album, and her songs' lack of refinement gives them a genuine melancholic feel."
1,One of the Worst product from Black and Decker,I have got false alrams from this device that there studs and never find it accuratley. I was surprised this is one of the Black and Decker product. I won't recommed this for anybody.
2,Beautiful WOnderful and moving,"Jerusalem:Center of the world Awesome,,,wish move documentarys were made like this,,I am hoping to visit the Holy Land soon ,,this has really inspired me to go where Jesus lived,, thanks so much"
2,Lost Books of Bible Review,"Lost Books are VERY good scripture that was taught to Christians in the first century A.D.. A particularly great text is in Bartholomew where abortion is directly addressed and is CLEARLY forbidden, something you cannot find in traditional, canonized scripture."
1,So Very Sad.....,I'm not going to repeat all the problems and praises of this series but suffice to say.....So Very Sad.
1,the lube your grandparents used,"We have moved beyond the sticky, slimy lube. Even KY has there own better lube. Try something like ID glide, or the KY intrigue, although that has to be reapplied more often."
1,Hated it,"Was expecting more flavor...it just tasted like regular cappuccino nothing with flavor. i thought I was purchasing flavor, as the title suggested."
1,"excellent hardware design, but not the rest","I own SV-SD80. It seems to me, that SD85 is the same model with bigger SD card. The sound is awesome, and it's the tinest player. But the rest is just unacceptable. Provided software is one the worst I ever saw. The ""firmware upgradable"" is just a promise, I still can't find upgrade and ""play list"" feature is still not available. It's hard to manage all songs on a big card as a lump. And I'm still hoping to get some helpful reply from Panasonic's customer support. This is the reason of giving 2 start instead of 5. BTW, I'm not pleased with it's headphones. I'm using foldable Sennheiser px-200; and so far did not see (hear) anything better."
1,"4 film favorites: Space jam, Looney Tunes Back in Action/Funky Monkey and Osmosis Jones","4 Film Favorites: Space Jam, Looney Tunes Back In Action/Funky Monkey and Osmosis JonesOnly one star for the quick shipment, unfortunately this collection did not include a disc for Space Jam, it only included two copies of Osmosis Jones/Funky Monkey!"
1,Make It Stop!,"Oh, its so bad! Please make it stop.I've been an STP fan from the beginning - I bought the first album when it came out because I liked the name of the band. And it turned out to be a great album, as was their second (in my mind, their masterpiece). But this, their third, is a mess. I've never been quite sure what they were trying to accomplish on this album but I find it amazing that this group of musicians all thought releasing this was somehow a good idea.STP was accused of being a Pearl Jam sound-alike when Plush first hit the scene. And since then they've followed Pearl Jam in one important way - they've branched out, tried different things and mixed up their sound. No two albums sound alike. They're constantly progressing. Unfortunately with this one though, they went off the deep end.Please resist the urge to follow the advice of the first track - don't push play."
1,Hornet Flight,"It's hard to believe Ken Follett could write a book this amateurish. It reads more like his first rather than his latest. The sentences are simple; basic statements are explained; the situations rather simplistic. The storyline is credible; the characters are not...much too naive. It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote The Eye of the Needle; The Key to Rebecca; The Pillars of the Earth (which I loved) and many other really fine books.If you must read it, check it out at the library and save your money for his next book. Hopefully, he'll return to his former style."
1,Check out the pages - Printing Error,Be very careful when you receive the book. Pages 139 through 202 are duplicated in the paperback form and then pages 203 through 266 are missing! So just when you think you are getting into the thick of things - you are missing a whole section. I am so frustrated.I was thoroughly enjoying the storyline too.
1,Pass this one by,"This short video is poorly produced, with the blaring noise and cheap graphics of the intro taking a significant portion of the half-hour runtime. Admittedly, many kid videos like these have ""cheesy"" or silly actors and actresses, but the narrating actress appears to have been chosen to keep the many men she talks to smiling at her looks and gushing naivety. I had hoped to find a DVD version of ""All About Heavy Construction Equipment"". This isn't it. Only a few trucks are featured, and compared to other videos it just doesn't measure up."
1,Waste of money,"Terrible purchase. Laggy rendering speed (think Powerpoint), horrible interface, boring concept. There's more fun in open-source and you don't have to put up with EA doing the DRM thing. Talk about not being able to take a clue from their customer base. Sheesh. gg EA."
2,Gotta to have it!,"I want my dog in the best shape. If she gets hurt, I need to help her!! I am buying this just in case I need it."
2,Great Kind of mushy but ..... it is Great,"IT is a pretty good book .I am only ten but I think it is too mushy and gushy it is easy to read for me .which is about sixth grade level if you think that death and kissing and all that this is the book for you it talks all about the wakefeild twins history and the same family name falls in this book three times the first time Alice and Theodore wakefeild, amanda and Ted wakefield , and alice,and Ned wakefield. This is the First Sweet Valley book that took memore than an hour to read"
2,great over all value,"I bought this product for my company, for the drivers to comunicate while doing drop-offs at banks and such. It works perfectly, and at 50 bucks, you can't beat em. My office is located in a 14th floor, and the parking lot is located in the basement of the building, sub level 4. I can still get great reception from my office to the parking lot. I recomend this item for anyone in the market for family/ recreational or work purposes.JorgeSanto Domingo"
1,"incomplete, scattered and of very little use",the book while touching on most things in the game does not go into the nuts and bolts of the game. While it tells you in coordinate systems where areas are it does not tell you how to reach these coordinates. It is way to general in scope.
1,Not for younger girls,My 11 yr old daughter wanted this book - I flipped through it and was really surprised at the content (for an 11 yr old). I told her it was meant for older girls and we then talked about sex being a very good thing when the time is right... - but that this book was not for her yet. I'm thinking maybe high scoool?? I'm just gald that I reviewed it myself first. Again not a bad book - just NOT for younger girls.
2,great rollator!,"I was able to use this rollator during my stay for PT at a medical rehab facility. The therapists had just acquired it for use in the PT rreatment room.I was so impressed with the way the rollator handled, that I got one for myself to replace the rollator that I already had at home.Not only is the lovely muted metallic rose color a pleasure, it is just a terrific rollator. The 8"" wheels are great for even going over areas in the house like going from carpet to bare floor, and although I have not tried it on grass, I suspect that it would work equally well.(....and now to continue on learning to walk again after not being able to use one leg for a year!)I am extremely pleased with this item!"
1,Bad product - worse customer support,"I purchased this drive for its security features and it was a big mistake. Software did not work so I contacted Iomega support. After 20 minutes of 'try this', 'try that' and 'try another computer' the end result was the same as the issue. Imoega promised to replace the drive if I return the defective drive. It has been over a month since Iomega received my damaged drive (sent via registered mail) and I still do not have my replacement. I keep getting the run around. Do not purchase this product unless you are a masochist that loves when a company runs all over you with lies. Whatever happend to the Iomega I once liked?"
1,Wanted more,Got better recipes for aebleskiver pancakes from a web search than in this book. I wasn't looking for other Danish recipes.
1,spirituality and energy control,"The author believes that there are parallels between the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, each stage representing a 'rite of passage' that must be honored in order to ascend with physical and spiritual health to the next. I found the parallels interesting and wonder if the similarities she perceives have their roots in mystic traditions that unfortunately gave way to the construction of organized religions. In any event, she made one statement that I suspect is the crux of spirituality. To paraphrase, ""We were put here on earth to learn to manage our energy"". Use this book as a springboard to others that address this issue more directly, like God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam."
1,Terrible Picture,"As other reviewers explain technically, the picture quality on this release is horrendous for bluray. Do not buy."
2,"A little too heavy, but very sturdy","I like that this is a metal turner, but it's a little too heavy. I have had my share of flimsy spatulas, and I wanted something that was a sturdier product. However, the size of this item is much larger and heavier than I expected or needed. Again, this is a great product, but expect something heavy and large. Perfect for grilling, not so much for pancakes."
1,non functioning CD's,Buyers beware. I ordered 2 copies of Autobiography of a Yogi and the CD's did NOT work.AB
2,My shaver works so much better.,I get a faster closer shave with the new razor replacemnt heads. Get some.
2,"for grownups, too","Don't be misled by the simple pictures and storybook style into thinking this a just a book for children. I have given this book to several adult friends, including some who are professional artists. We all learned something from Molly Bang's clear and compelling explanations of the principles of visual composition."
2,A new Femi fan!,"I had never seen or heard of Femi Kuti until recently when he performed at the World Music Awards. His amazing performance of ""Beng Beng Beng"" was the highlight of the event! I was drawn to the amazing rhythmic afro beats in the instrumental aspects of his music and the sensuality in his voice. I bought this CD because of it and am truly impressed with it. ""Shoki Shoki has several great tracks besides the above mentioned including, ""Truth Don Die"" and ""Eregele"". Femi's music is filled with so much energy that it's hard to stay still when listening to it."
1,Thought I would Love Anything Delbert Releases,"I am a dyed in the wool Delbert McClinton fan. Love the way he sings honky tonk and love the way he sings the blues. But this album was a real disappointment. Mainly because Delbert sounds like everyone except Delbert. Couldn't find even one Delbert song. While the first song (Don't Let Go) didn't sound like Delbert, it was still fun to listen to. Unfortunately that was the only one I could enjoy. The rest were more like famous songs sung by unknowns.I'll still add Delbert albums to my wish list. Maybe this is the only real disappointment that he's ever released!"
2,Don't miss out!,"Oh my, it's here and it's excellent! This is probably my favorite season of Highlander and all 22 of the episodes on 8 discs are entertaining and exciting. This is a definite must have for any Highlander fan or anyone who really enjoys martial arts and intriguing storylines. The bonus features alone are incredible and a definite must have. With commentary, bonus footage, and even a trivia game it just makes the series alot more behind-the-scenes and interactive with the viewer. I had to buy mine the first day it came out, so what are you waiting for? Go ahead and order or you'll be sorry."
1,still the same,"cant tell any difference. took it for a month and still feel the same as i did before. i also take other pills so i dont want to stop taking all of them, to find out. i eat very healthy food so maybe that is all i need."
1,This item is misrepresented,This carrying case is 1/4 too small to hold the CD player it is associated with on amazon. And not worth the hassle of returning.amazon.com should delist this product.
1,Easily chewed up,"I bought the medium for my Staffordshire terrier to ""mix it up"" with her toys when she is crated. Within a few hours she had gnawed enough off of it that pieces of rubber were coming out and I had to take it away for her own safety. The flying saucer shape is really interesting and moves/rolls in fun ways, but the durability is definitely lacking. However, I have also purchased the Busy Buddy squirrel and the ""Waggle"" bone and those two items, even though they are the same brand, have held up fine!"
2,A fast-paced whoddunit!,"""DEGREES OF SEPARATION is a teaser-a fast-paced whodunnit with complex characters and an intriguing plot that keep the reader mesmerized and coming back for more until each fascinating clue is stripped down to the naked truth.""--Barbara Colley, author of MAID FOR MURDER"
1,"Does what it says, but I got a weird fuzz.","Not sure if the problem is my TV, my Xbox 360 or both. But I bought this cable because I wanted to upres my DVDs, and indeed it does work for that purpose. However, the quality of the picture, although slightly sharper than the composite cable, got weird and fuzzy. Might have something to do with refresh rate, I don't know.I returned the cable and am happy with my composite. I now use a HDMI DVD player to upres. They cost $50 on Amazon."
1,"Terrible Book, Buggy Code Samples","For an introduction to Internet programming techniques, this book is too narrowly focussed. It only covers and implements a proprietary Internet control completely ignoring Wininet and Winsock. On top of this the code samples are extremely buggy and are not supported by the author's VB website! Avoid at this price, might be useful at bargain basement prices only as alearning exercise in debugging terrible code."
1,Weak power supply,"Antec has dropped the ball on this one. My power supply came in DOA.If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.The case weighs 25 pounds. It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles."
1,worst online purchase ever!!,"I bought 2 of this item from these guys for my kids laptops. One of them came defective and I reqested a full refund for both beacuse they said that according to Amazon policy I had to pay shipping cost for returned items. It has been almost a month sending emails back and forth and I still haven't seen my refund back yet. Needless to say, my kids are still unable to use their laptops and I am extremely unhappy with these guys. I will NEVER buy from them again."
2,One of the Greatest Films Ever,"talk about a film that brings it from start to finish? also the supporting Cast was on point.the pacing of the film,style&feel ruled the way that films in the years to come where made to appear.this film is timeless&just gets fresher with every new viewing."
1,Found out I couldn't take it,"I watched this thinking I would be able to just sit there and the music replacement would not bother me.I was wrong.By the time I got to Toolie's burial and not having Whiter Shade of Pale there, I had had enough.Maybe if the price is really really low, maybe I can consider getting the rest of this series, but for now I am stopping at Season 3."
1,ABSOLUTE WORST RELIABILITY,"ABSOLUTE WORST RELIABILITYI've owned my CC radio for a number of years. Over time every single button has found a way to malfunction. The channel buttons don't change channels but they do change the memory setting so press enough of the buttons and they all end up set on the same frequency. Sometimes pressing a channel select button turns on the alarm.As I turn the large channel select on the side it goes up a couple of channels then goes back to where I started over and over and over again.The on/off button only works sometimes or not at all. It's quite a frustration trying to find the right spot on the button to turn it off. Then there's the night light button, which like the on/off button may or may not work.I called C Crane and Company, explained the problems and lack of reliability and was told for a stiff fee I could return my radio and wait eight weeks to get it back."
2,Great,I sell books on Amazon and these envelopes are great. The are not super expensive but they do the job. The sticky part is super sticky so you don't have to worry about taping it.
2,Can't Get enough!,"I can't get enough of this series...please, please make more! Very classy, accurate for the era, like eating a wonderful dessert."
2,Great Film for the Whole Family,"Having read through a few of the reviews for this film, I am suprised to see a few 1 and two star ratings. For me, it has been one of the most heartwarming films I have seen this Year, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Call me sentimental if you will, but the public need to see a few more films of this calibre on their TV Screen."
2,"Love this book, my 4 year old is very keen on it too","The illustrations in this book are gorgeous, bright but softly sumptuous watercolours. This is a dinosaur story, but the dinosaurs involved are rounded and loveable even the bully Tyrone.this is about Boland, a dinosaur who is being bullied. He asks his friends advice, and gets bad advice each time - or at least advice which doesn't always work. In the end Boland figures out his own way to deal with Tyrone - and it works.Nice little epilogue at the end of the story about what happens to Tyrone.I am not sure if there are any significant messages in this for kids. But bullying is such a problem it is good to bring up some kinds of solutions.I think this is more a book which looks good rather than has good messages. Great fun and my four year old really enjoys it."
2,"Pricey, but worth it","If you have a Honeywell electronic air filter that uses these, it is worth replacing them once or twice a year. I vacuum them occasionally in between."
2,highland champion,"I love every book that I have ever read by Hannah Howell. This book was my favorite though .Every time I read a book by this author I think that it could not be as good as the last , but every book is just as good.i look forward to my next 5 books by Hannah Howell. No one writes as well in my opinion."
2,Amazing,"I am going to recommend this movie to our youth leader at our church. This movie made such a loud and bold statement! Emily did such a real performance here (totally got her out of the Hannah Montana mold!!!) The makers of this movie told it exactly the way it is and left nothing for the imagination. It is a heartbreaking story that makes you want to jump through the TV, it makes you cry, and it makes you open your eyes to the realness of this issue."
1,not workable,Who can tell me how to open it and insert the battery?I don't think there is a way for doing so. But I hope I am wrong
1,Didn't work for long,"I have two boys, 7 and 2, both thumb-suckers. At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs. My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he'd fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway. My 2-year-old wants to suck his thumb constantly. I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again. I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!"
1,"Cute, but not comparable to the original.","My son has seen this once and has not shown interest in watching it again. Disappointing, since it was $25 through the Disney DVD Club. I wouldn't reccommend to anyone who loves the original. You will be let down."
2,A fun and educational show for preschoolers,"This is a really good show for preschoolers; I just wish there were more episodes. It teaches life lessons as well as features songs and activities. No, don't use this to teach your kids Mandarin Chinese; there're few Chinese words. But that's the whole point... it's a general-audience show for all preschoolers, and it does a great job at that. The characters are loveable -- and easier on the eye. The young actress who does Kai-lan's voice does a superb job -- she's my second favorite Nick Jr. voice actor, after the SpongeBob guy. :) This DVD features 4 episodes, as well as a ""My Favorite Places"" music video. The video is in 4:3 format, just like it is on regular TV."
1,Experienced Users be Prepared to Start from Scratch,"Excel 2007 replaces the tried and true menu layout with new graphical ribbon that is totally alien to experienced users.Save your money, do not buy Excel 2007 if you expect to find a product that remotely resembles any of the previous Excel versions."
1,Second Read of Bronx Zoo,"I read this book years ago, after reading Jim Bouton's Ball Four, but did not have a good recollection of the book. Now I know why. Although there are some entertaining parts in general the book is only average as a written work and the content, as one reviewer noted, is first person whiny. Sparky Lyle should have stuck to pitching and focused more on being a competitor. The book is filled with contradictions as he relates hsi values as an athelete. Save your money."
2,I LOVE GHOST HUNTERS!,"If you haven't watched this show at all and you are interested in the paranormal, what are you waiting for? This is, in my opinion, the best paranormal show. I can't wait for Wednesday's at 9PM to watch this show! You never know what's going to happen or what they may find. The St. Augustine Lighthouse episodes are my favorite. What they capture on video is just astonishing! I could probably talk all day about the EVPs I've heard from this show. I can't wait for Season 4 to kick off!!!"
1,Misrepresented on Amazon,"I just received this book. The description states it is leather bound with ribbon markers. This book is NOT leather bound, nor are there any ribbon markers. The book I received was a cheap copy, produced with fiberboard covers. Going back. Not acceptable."
1,Defective product,The Audio CD's were defective. About half the chapters not play at all. Just dead air! very disappointing because I want to review the information while driving.
2,Great Book But No More Diets for Me,"I applied some of the principles of this book for a while, but I've really just decided to stop dieting and live as the French do. No more diets, no more fasting. I'm just going to enjoy wonderful whole foods in moderate portions. I highly recommend the following: Chocolat & French Women Don't Get Fat. Bon Appetit, Y'all!!!"
2,THE HOBBIT,"Filled with action and the fun of dwarves, elves, goblins, the hobbit Bilbo, Gandalf the grey bearded wizard, and the Dragon !!"
1,Not correct....,"This listing for this item is incorrect. There are only about 13 songs on each CD. I bought it for the song ""Look at Them Beans"". It was not included. I returned it to Amazon for a reported ""bad batch"". The replacement CD was exactly the same as the first."
2,Rummy with TILES,"This will be a great addition to your 'GAME NIGHT"". We played with 4 and it was a blast. Requires strategic planning and sharp moves. Don't be fooled. Brain power is a must if you want to win with this game!"
2,Best book light out there,This one is by far the best book light out there. I read every night and the batteries need replacing about once a month.
2,Does the job,"Nothing really relevant to say, charges the camera while in use, doesn't heat the camera like most chargers.Easy to use, easy to connect, good accessory for your video shootings."
2,Amazing Read,"This book is AMAZING. I litterally could not put it down, and finished it in 4 hours. The story told by Immaculee will bring you to tears as you contemplate the absolute horrors endured by the people of Rwanda. Despite all this, Immaculee tells the story without a trace of bitterness or resentment.Her story of courage and forgiveness is a lesson to us all, and an absoulte MUST READ."
1,"Long Live the ""Golden Age""!","Fritz Leiber distances himself from the other authors in this book in that his story, ""Gonna Roll the Bones"", has a story and understandable characters, even if those characters are not admirable. If there is a way to find this story in another collection, I would recommend finding it there. The remainder of this book is not intended to be enjoyed. Instead it is intended as a rebellion against SF authors from the ""Golden Age"".My suspicion is that Harlan Ellison intended to ""revolutionize"" SF with this book, but all he wound up doing was showing that revolutions start with ideas, not declaring ""Revolution!"". The irony was that a ""Golden Age"" author, Leiber, wrote the only quality story in this anti-""Golden Age"" book."
2,What Marcel saw,"Maybe has-been harlots of the Belle Epoque affected, entre elles-memes, the wit of Wilde characters, which American actors render under direction in fleeting Hollywood Edwardian. The accents come and go chasing the screenplay's segues first to Colette's very different style and then to more modern takes on women's wares and tears, all to dress up and down what two people are deciding nobility obliges. Together Hampton, Frears and Friend keep the tale's surprise. While Lea has been no nanny but doubly nude throughout, a delicately draped performance by Pfeiffer, Friend's dandy shows himself, in retrospect, the moralist at his wit's end. The only touch missing is a real picture of Kathy Bates when she was an ingenue of the first water, as her character in the corps de ballet."
2,reasonably impressed,"I would actually give this album a 3.5 out of 5 stars for little reasons that are to do with my own expectations in music, but Sarah delivers very nicely with this album. Possession, Ice Cream, and a couple others are among my favorites wit this album. Sarah's album ""surfacing"" is perfect in my opinion, while her two albums that came prior to ""Fumbling towards Ecstasy"" seemed less interesting, yet nonetheless recognized her talent. I would recommend this album for anyone who enjoys adult contemporary music, and where this genre collides with pop music."
1,do not buy i repeat do not buy!!!!!!!!!,this item sucks i got it when i lost the regular one and i put it on the psp but i kept getting stuck up top and i kept having to pause the game take the stick of move it around then put the stick back on every five seconds its hard to use its terrable moving gets me killed playing shooting games online so now i wasted my money and i just have to go with that little nub that holds the stick it hurts my thumb and i cant play games for very long because it hurts so much im getting way less use out of my psp because of it dont buy these get something else
2,SoloSider,Excellent tool if you are installing clapboard (hardiplank) by yourself. You will still need to climb ladders but it gets the job done correctly.
1,Okay but not a book I'll reread,"I'm a big fan of true crime but I wasn't enthused about this book. I found myself skimming pages, a sure sign that the author wasn't holding my attention. The subject held promise for a good read but the story just kinda, sorta ""wandered."""
1,"Fantastic Idea, but Poor Plot","I don't know how Universal hurt a movie that had such a great idea, but couldn't produce it correctly. It is hard to screw up this story. You have a story about a secret society, one of the most powerful in the world, and instead of developing that plot, it looked as though this was a skit on Saturday Night Live making fun of the story itself. The acting was particularly poor and it was hard to have a strong level of empathy with any of the characters. Not one stands out. All the characters appear shady, dark, depressing, and yet, it is quite clear that not all of the characters deserved this trait. We didn't really learn that much about the secret society (other than it likes to keep secrets) and the school the students were attending. Where is it? Yale, I presume; but there is little discussion on what the students are like who aren't in the secret society. I think this movie could have been done much better."
2,Here's hoping for an Xtra-Plastic Fang,"Damn those Japanese imports... JSBX saves some of their beststuff for overseas. ""Ghetto Mom"" deserves to be on the domesticversion but, alas, you must shell out $ to get it on this. Theother ""import"" tracks are OK, and are just as good as whats on the U.S. release.I wish they'd put the BEST tracks on the album and save thethrowaway cuts for b-sides and imports."
1,I do not like it at all!!!,This is a piece of junk and a waste of money. The pages are pourly made for the ages recommened. My First LeapPad pages are better than these pages.
1,Worst Jason film-BY FAR,"This movie sucks. Friday the 13th part 7 with Terry Kiser from Weekend at Bernie's was even better. Jason Lives and Jason takes Manhattan were not as good as part 1, 3, 4 and 5 but are masterpieces compared to this pile of crap. From Friday the 13th part 1 to Jason goes to Hell, there was a lot of originality from the series lost in that short time span!"
2,V-1 Flying Bomb,"This book deals with the V-1 Flying Bomb,from its inception,its development,and its strugle to become an operational weapon of terror.This is a very short paged book with excellent color diagrams and period b/w photos;a good introductory book."
2,Taking Chance,AMAZING MOVIE OF A DEDICATED SENIOR OFFICER TAKING INITIATIVE AND CARE OF A SOLDIER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYOME. MUST WATCH!!!!
2,They work,"I was hessitant at first but was desperate to protect my furniture, I gave them a shot. They absolutely work. Just make sure to clip claws before applying them and make sure get the right size. I got large when I really should have gotten medium. They still works but I had to clip part of them to work. Now with the. Right size they are perfect. So far 5weeks and only a few have fallen off my 2 cats"
2,"Different, but worthy","While this disc's format is mainly electronic in feel, its unique take on the great Bob Marley is by no means disrespectful. The songs stay true to the tempo and spirit of the original recordings while using the electronic beats more as augmentation. If you like Marley, and you like electronic music, then this would be a welcome addition to any collection."
2,Thought provoking,"First class writing - Ruth Rendell is one of the best writers of this genre. Great plot, truly believable characters and despite being written decades ago, it still rings true to today's world. Rendell's characters are real people in life-like situations and Wexford is one of the most down to earth detectives ever imagined who comes to life on the page with a humanity that we should all strive to achieve in reality.I recommend this book to all readers who appreciate great writing, great characters, intricate plotting and an author who understands the frailty of human existence and the nuances of human interaction, both intellectual and emotional, in our daily lives.LR"
1,Should get 5 NEGATIVE stars,"What is wrong with us that we put trash like this on the bestseller list? I don't know anything about the writer's connections but there is something wrong going on if a book like this gets published. There's literally nothing good about it. Well, perhaps the ending is good but I couldn't get that far. It's just a truly terrible book. I suggest you buy something, anything, else and hope that the author goes back to being a society lady or whatever she was before she got the idea that she could write."
2,one of the best hair colour booster,"certainly one of the best hair color booster on the market adapted for my type of ahir colour... a shame it's impossible to find in europe...living in switzerland and greece, i wish i could find it here in europe...any address on where i could find it in those countries....? thanx"
2,The definitive Sherlock Holmes,Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes. The Granada series is a collector item and I recommend it to Conan Doyle fans everywhere.
2,Good kit,"I would have given this product 5 stars, but the fuse holder melted. I bought two of these kits, one for my component speakers and the other for my sub. It may have melted because I needed to run 4 gauge wire to my subs instead of the 8. Other than that bought kits have worked fine."
1,Worst Mp3 i have ever had!!!!,"The player only lasts one or two hours with 1 aaa battery. Sometimes it turns on when its in my pocket and wont stop playing, and it goes dead. i hate it. dont buy it"
1,Nepotism at its finest.,"I don't understand the hype about this book. The writing style was amateurish. The ending was telegraphed right from the start, the only shocking think was just how over the top it was. The only reason this manuscript wasn't thrown in the trash where it belongs, is clearly because of his father who just happens to be the editor of Sports Illustrated."
2,Good book,My Mother is really into art and I bought this for her b-day. When I got it I looked through it and it was very informational and had some really cool facts and pictures about art.
1,Dont buy it from KV Pet supplies,"The product is great and I use it daily for all my dogs. Buy it, but not from KV Pet supplies. I ordered with them and they never sent the item. Repeated emails were not returned. It was only when I filed a dispute with Amazon that the item finally showed up....a month and a half after the order was placed."
1,artsy craftsy,"Not useful. Might be ok for an artsy craftsy person who makes things that are fairly useless, but I was hoping to be able to put together a useful book that was a bit unique. These examples are uniquely unique and impractical."
1,Rip Off,"Too bad I can't get my money back, because of the return policy on ""hazardous substances."" This version of Concentre sold by Amazon is weak, and bitter, probably because it is old like the other reviewer stated. I should've listened to him. Half the quality of the original I'm used to.Nor is the bottle LIMITED EDITION as it advertises."
1,Really?,"This is just a repackaged edition of the same book. I read it 10 years ago and was not impressed with its religious overtones. That aside, where does Rick Warren come off calling this non-fiction? These writings are his opinion and nothing more. No thanks."
1,where is it?,bought a subscription on 12/14. nothing here on 1/20. hope it comes or get my money back.
2,Hoover 40321130 Premium Pet Formula Carpet/Upholstery Detergent,Hoover products are my first choice because I have had good experiences with them. The convenience of being able to order several bottles of this carpet cleaner is great!! Product arrived in a timely fashion and was not damaged. Thanks!
1,watered down,This is a white wash version of Charlie...I have used Charlie for my years in the past so i know how powerful and lasting the Charlie scent is....This one is the total opposite.....Charlie by revlon is no longer a brand.....wasted my money
2,Yamaha Stereo Receiver,Easy to install and use. Great sound for the price however lacking in bass. Sounds wonderful for classic music but not as good for today's music that contains more bass for the total affect. Overall a good buy.
1,I will never ever use ATT/Cingular even if they pay me!!,"I'm in Boston/Cambridge area and getting dropped calls, busy network, dead spots all--the--time!!! BTW, I get 24% discount on my monthly fee through my wife's company and I will definitely switch regardless the signifcant savings."
2,Perfect little Vac Dirt Devil Breeze,I wanted a light weight vac for my wood floors that had a soft brush. This is perfect for me..Easy to use and handy tools right on the handle. I bought this 2 years ago for my daughter and she loves hers also!
2,Real insight into the thinking of well-known author,"If you enjoy the Spenser novels, you will probably enjoy this - although the novel is not about Spenser. The main character wants to win the fair haired maiden at any cost and in that sense is romantic. What is lacking is any real history of the main character that would give him more life. The ending is like a fairy tale. The main reason I read this was to provide insight into the thinking of the author who created Spenser, who in my opinion is a wonderful character. If I hadn't read the Spenser novels and really enjoyed them I doubt I would have read and enjoyed this novel."
2,Margaret Whiting songs,A longtime favorite of mine. This is a wonderful recording and I will get many hours of enjoyment. Fast shipment and well priced.
1,Worst Laurell K. Hamilton novel I've read,"Micah is, by Hamilton standards, little more than a short story. Not much plot, 3 chapters on one sex act alone (I skipped most of it), no buildup to the end and a very dud of an ending. Ms. Hamilton is capable of very much more. Her earliest novels in this series were the best. In her latest novels, the focus on erotica, lots and lots of fetish (blood & pain) erotica. I like her writing when she is describing Anita Blake in action, other than sexually, and enjoy the twists and turns of the plots. But the recent focus, obssession really, on fetish-like sex is beginning to make reading her novels uncomfortable.This particular novel includes that obssessive focus on extreme sex but very little of anything else. I'm very disappointed with this effort and hope her future novels are back on track - with considerably less emphasis on extreme sex."
2,For Those Who Struggle With Workplace Pain/Issues,"If your whole identity is wrapped up in your work, and your self esteem can be be ripped away in a flash depending on what others think of you, give this book a try. Even if you don't agree with all of it, the central message is healing and redeeming. Anytime I find I am being tossed about on the choppy, merciless waves of the opinions of people, I find comfort in the message of this book. Because I took its message to heart, I have been more successful in life than I could have ever imagined. People comment on how amazingly stress-free I seem in spite of a demanding job, and I can attribute this all to this book. I know now, in a deep and lasting way, where my true value is, and how the deep and multifaceted impact of Jesus'work on the Cross is where my importance is."
2,another home run for jorge lewis,in this album this novel artist really shows his potencial as a singer and a song writer.its incredible how somebody that young can fit so well in this territory(boleros)this album is definetly a home rum.
2,Gazillion Bubbles Buzz Lightyear,"Our four year old grandson loved it and it had been on his ""wish list"" to get from Santa. He had a good time with it."
1,Not the same,"I love Thymes Filigree and when it disappeared from the stores I was lost. Then I decided to try on line. This is not the same fragrance. It has hints of the original but is ""thinner"" and something is missing. I will not order this way again."
2,Very helpful and informative,"This has alot of good information! It focuses on Ayurveda, and the principles of the ancient lifestyle. It seems very holistic...but perhaps not super realistic for those of us that work long hours away from home. I like the vibe of the whole thing, slowing down, becoming more aware, working from an angle of balance and prevention-rather than addressing the illness"
2,Thought provoking reality check,"This book was recomended to me by my mother and I am so glad she did. I truly enjoyed this book. The author takes you through the outback, a untamecd jouney of the spirit. I stronlgy suggest anyone who wants a short book that makes you question your place in the world."
2,Great Product!,"Hot Tools by far makes the best curling irons on the market. I have used the 3/4 in and just purchased the jumbo 1"". These give me curls for days and days!I give 5/5 stars!"
1,product has incorrect description,"The product description for this page describes the product as 15 meters, but it is really 15 ft."
1,A disgrace to modern literature.,"Hello. I am Francisco González, the leader of the Emerald Forest Association Against Awful Literature(EFAAAL for short). My association has decided to condemn this book as""pathetic."" You will hear more from my frieds, but in short: this book is pathetic. Bad characters, bad form, and insulting morals. I think anyone who likes this book needs to think it over again. You will hear from our people."
1,This is not as described....,This comes as a male usb cable. This is great if you need an Ethernet port but if you have some creative way to use it.... Do Not Bother! I tried to make an external hard drive into a network drive.... That did not go according to plan... I actually returned this male and female usb ports are different.
2,Over your ear and Away You Go,"My original headset had a thin plastic loop that slipped over the ear. It broke and couldn't find a part. This design has you loop over the ear, decide on ear bud size, select earbud a size smaller so that it can nest in tight and away you go.While it's cumbersome to get in place over your ear (especially with glasses) I love how it's snug allowing me to hear well and stays that way."
1,Revisited but not improved,I have this problem with Scott Card's children -- they read about 12 years older than they are supposed to be and it's definately the case in this work which revisits Ender Wiggin's childhood but from a very different point of view. In the notes Scott says he was originally going to open this to other authors. I think he should have. It's a not very good sequel that lacks the power of Ender's Game.
2,This NZXT Cryo LX Laptop Cooler is worth the bucks!!!,"Pros: Easily handles laptops up to 19"" wide screen.Three large cooling fans with speed control.EXTRA Sturdy aluminum construction.Folds down for easy transport.Four port USB hub included.Silver is the natural color for aluminum so there will beno color issues with this model.Cons: Loose two laptop USB ports: one for power and onefor the USB HUB. (I have suggested to NZXT to include aCOMBO Patch cord that could replace the two cords providedor a plug in power supply with USB PATCH cord to solve theloss of two USB LAPTOP ports.)The edges are metal and could be a little more rounded on thecorners so be careful when placing this on your antique tablesto work on.Conclusion: This thing works!!! It's sturdy and I expect it to way outlast my laptop... The CRYO LX is well worth the money."
1,Not worth it....,"I purchased this for our daughter in January. I have a Honda Civic and it barely covered the window. So I decided to turn them sideways, hoping that more of the window would be covered; nope! I agree with the other reviews, it is very difficult to see though these also. I purchased a set of shades that you can see through, are attatched with suction cups and were available in two sizes that are SO much better, and I only paid [money]..."
1,couldn't get it to work well,Be careful of this product. It drops the signal too much for my Samsung to recognize the signal and for the couterpart Sharp to recognize either.
2,Thornetta Davis,The CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thornetta Davis' music should be a part of every blues lover's collection!
2,Cute Hat!,"I bought this hat for my boyfriend's birthday. The rim is a bit floppy, but this just adds to the casual cuteness. It has a vintage look to it, and is great for a casual hat!"
2,TRACK LISTING,TRACKS:1. Di Bolina2. Nel Bene E Nel Male3. Cio' Che Ci Resta4. Sul Confine5. Cose Che Dimentico6. Tracce7. Notti Di Genova8. L'era Dell'oro9. La Notte Di San Loren
1,Embarrassed!,"I once read that Grishom said he would never write anything that would embarrass his children or his mother. Well, I bet his whole family is red-faced now. The Brethren took us on such a twisted, depraved path that I stopped after 100 pages convinced I could find more edifying material to fill my mind! This was such a disappointment following The Testament which offered hope to the weary and worn-out. John, you must have had a terrible year. Don't leave us with this trash...you owe it to your self and to us."
2,Need some good laughs-- with useful advice? Read this!,"Having heard Frances Weaver on the TODAY show, I was anxious to read her book, and what a pleasure it was! I have since given copies to many of my friends, and they also enjoy her wit and wisdom! I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in living life to the fullest -- Frances Weaver is an inspiration, and her attitude toward life is refreshing! She concentrates on ""why not?"" instead of ""how to""-- and does it very well."
1,You have got to be kidding Me,"After seeing Suze on PBS I decided to go out and get this book. About 40 pages into the work I came to the conclusion that this tome is more about marketing and salemanship than investing. There are a lot of naive people though that might buy this book thinking that it will help them, but nothing could be further from the truth. The picture on the front cover is ""clownish"", the advice is sometimes just as funny and the only person laughing all the way to the bank is Suze."
2,Bob Dylan,"Bob Dylan Live, 1966.It is nice to go down Memory Lane and I am glad to have purchased the CD. I do have to say, though, I love his new music as much as I love his music from earlier years. For me, ""Dylan"" will always remain ""Dylan"".Ursula"
1,Very disappointing p,Very disappointed with this book. It ended up being more of a joke book (not that funny). I was looking for a book of projects for my grandson. I bought him several rolls of duct tape but the book didn't have any projects--just foolish jokes. Even my 11-year old grandson was disappointed. Thanks a lot for the Christmas gift fiasco. Don't waste your money. Once you read the jokes there is no need to keep the book.
2,what i expected good value,exactly what i expected... hardest part is getting started but it is what i wanted..videos online show me how to use
2,Rock on,"This band can knock it out of the park. Hard driving guitar licks that are a nice change from the technotronic music of the 80's. Get this one, it rocks."
1,"Un buen libro para que el que no conoce nada de pitufos, continúe sin conocer nada de Pitufos.","Este libro incluye inmensas fotografias de muñecos de pvc, sin un orden particular, simplemente como muestra y con la oculta intencion de ocupar espacio. El estado de estos es bastante pobre. Es mas...Pitufina con raqueta de tenis, que es un muñeco de lo mas facil de conseguir...no tiene raqueta!!!El resto son sets generalmente a medio completar.Creo que es una lastima producir un libro asi, que podria haber sido un poco mejor si hubiese sido realizado por alguien mas entendido en el tema."
2,THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scences are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the inoccent hobitt on a journey. Orlando Bloome shined agian in his role of Legolas. Viggo Morteson was just bloody brillant for Aragon. As a fan of the book series, Peter Jackson was able to sew together a series that will last well over a thousend years. The special effects were exellent but in some parts a little over done. Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving also made this movie a great film. Overall this film has it all. Romance, a journey that seems to never end, the test of a friendship and much much more! You have to see this film more then once!"
2,A great series,"Another great book in the Bolitho series. A must-read for any fan of historical naval fiction, but start at the beginning! Twenty-seven books in the series, all very entetaining novels!"
2,Alex Mack was a great show,Alex Mack was an awesome show and in my opinion one of Nickelodeon's best. They need to release the other seasons though. ALso its annoying that Jessica Albums all over the dvd and shes only in like ..three episodes. Shes not even a main character.. they could have at least put Ray on the second disc cover. Hopefully we will get a better dvd of this awesome show in the future.
2,Truly Awesome!!,"I have had this book for many, many years and I use it as a resource for energy healing in many ways. This book is unlike any book I have ever had or studied. David is quite thorough in his energy healing recipes, and it is very easy to read and follow. I can't get enough of Davids work; I wish he would publish more......he is very gifted!"
1,Twister had great sound and effects-period.,Twister gets a star for the best sound in a movie I have ever heard. Twister gets a star for some good special effects. Twister gets absolutely no stars for its actors/actresses (especially Helen Hunt) and its plot. That's all I have to say.
2,the invisible boy,charlie bone a while ago descovers he needs to bloores acadamy. He descovers somthing wrong. Whats wrong. Read to find out.
1,problems,"I bought this bugaboo for my newborn son because it is versatile and solid. After mounting it, I inflated the back tires with the pump provided (not an easy task, because the pump is really small): twenty minutes later, one of the tires EXPLODED. I found out that it is not an uncommon problem. I sent an email to their customer service and they did not reply in the next 24 hours. I called and a customer service representative naturally gifted with bad manners told me that they will send a replacement for the exploded tire. Delivery time: 7 business days, which basically means two weeks between the explosion and my possibility to use the stroller. Way too long for a new baby!"
2,Great Book,I love this book. There are a lot of photos and descriptions. She uses a lot of beading embellishments along with hand formed and stamped images. A different approach than I've seen before. It's filled with different ideas of putting together the fabrics and papers. A great gook.
1,Muslim Islamic 'End of World' Day,"""Major Signs of Qiyamat"" (Day of Judgment) by ""Maulana Mufti Mohammad Shafi""; translated by ""Mufti Afzal Hoosen Elias""; 12 (twelve) pages; paperback. Contents: Ahadith chosen by ""Hazrat Allama Sayed Muhammad Anwar Shah Kashmiri"", c. 1997."
1,Cecilio Bb Clarinet,This is a poor product as the metal for the keys bends easily and makes the clarinat out of tune or not playable. I needed to have it repaired too quickly. Paying more for higher quality is worth it.
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"This book is so lame. It couldn't hold my attention through 5 pages! It just goes on and on with Tayo's pointless flashbacks. I had to read this book for school and every kid that read it wanted to burn it. So many kids hated it, our teacher isn't going to make next years class read it. Throughout the book it will be talking about one thing and in midsentence it will change to another subject and tense. There is no plot and the whole book in general is just sooo boring. Silko blames everything that goes wrong on white people. According to the book, Indians think white people were made by witches to destroy the earth. If you have to read it for school I feel sorry for you, but if you don't have to read it please don't!"
1,Not much new under the sun,"This book is pretty standard. The design is awful and will give one a headache just attempting to keep up with the graphics and sidebars. I'm a Tom Peters fan, but this book was a disappointment. He states the obvious, retreads old stuff, and makes no compelling case, other that his ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" attitude (which is admirable to a point). Glad I bought this at a deeply discounted price, for I would have returned if purchased for full retail. Not his best work by a long shot."
2,Baptism At Bull Run,"This story is a riveting tale that takes you inside the first battle of the Civil War after Fort Sumter. Reger puts you inside the minds and hearts of the politicians, generals, and common soldiers on both sides of conflict. His description of battlefield surgery is as vivid as any portrayed by the movies. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the real story behind the Battle of Bull Run."
2,My kids and I love this series,"My kids and I find this series immensely entertaining. Bizarre and intriguing situations got me hooked. This one is about a hungry witch who tried to conjure up a soft-boiled egg for her dinner but ended up with dinosaur eggs. Short enough to keep a one- or two-year-old's attention. Unusual vocabulary. Mog in the Fog (a trek with a sherpa and a yeti), Meg on the Moon, Meg and Mog, and Meg's Veg are all fabulous."
2,this really works,"have 3 Kittehs and they were all seeming stressed by the latest rescue we brought home. we heard about this product and got it to try. I am delighted to report this really helps all of our Kittehs to be cool and happy with out trying to cram something down the throat or sticking with a needle!! Please keep producing this product. My Kittehs are much better for this. They play with each other and with us, instead of hissing and spitting and growling at each other."
1,do not be misled!,"the two reviews theat say this CD is the first album by the band neu! are wrong. the other review is correct: this is not the krautrock classic. i believe that it is actually under copyright control and is only available as a pirate. which is a shame, because it is one of the finest pieces of elctronic music ever made. zen-like in its magnificence. when they make a film of my life, the opening track from neu! will be used to theme the 'tantric sex virginity loss' scene; it is tranquil, sensuous and life-altering (and lasts for 10 minutes - if only!). but, like i said, this CD here is not it, so keep looking."
1,Ping pong pow-wow,These were low quality ping pong balls - ok for the kids to goof around playing with - but they do not fly straight when hit...and they have a seam around the entire ball - so they arent even smooth flat balls.
2,Excellent Quality and Worked Perfecty,"I bought this cable to use a Sony Bravia 32"" LCD TV as a monitor for my laptop computer. The TV has a maximum of 720 lines and supports resolutions to 1360 x 768. The cable and connectors are heavy duty and the picture quality is supurb. The cost of the cable was about one third the prices is saw in local stores for comparable products. I highly recommend this product."
1,A movie barely cobbled together,"Stephanie (Isabel García Lorca) finds a beautiful white stallion one day and takes it home with her - ""Honest, Dad, he followed me home from school"" - and turns him into a show-jumper. Meanwhile, Lightning's rightful owner, Barney (Mickey Rooney) is wondering what's become of his horse. Perhaps it's karma for taking something that isn't hers, because shortly after finding the critter Stephanie is diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease and has her pride and joy stolen from her by Barney's creditors. Lazy acting meshes with the poor continuity, and overwrought storyline.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Deservingly lost in the mix,"The title track barely made an appearance on radio airwaves, and then it was forgotten. Some of this sounds like softer Filter, incorporating some electronic elements while retaining a definite rock sound. These guys almost seem to be ""going through the motions"" on these tracks; fairly simple (yet none too driving) guitar parts (alternation between TWO chords too often) abound, and lyrics seem bereft of genuine emotion. Granted, this is by no means a particularly bad approach to rock--nor is it an unpleasant listen--it just lacks the oomph to leave a lasting impression. Not only will intermittent listening render one unable to place the single's title with music (save perhaps the chirping falsetto oo-oo bridge); you won't remeber this seemingly random-named band either. This is a decent everyband."
1,Too Much to Swallow,"This highly touted book did not appeal to me at all. The lessons are depressing, overbearing, and contained too much negative information for me. Each ""lesson"" leads me to feel that I will never be able to turn my circumstances around, and I get upset just thinking about picking it up and resuming reading it. The ""lessons"" are just too harsh, too time consuming, too much work, requiring time and focus that a busy career woman just does not have. Obviously written by a man, for men. Maybe I'm just not ready for it. Not one of the ""successful"" people mentioned in the book by the author is a female!!! Go figure!"
1,WORST PHONE EVER,"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE EVER. DON'T GET TEMPTED BY THE REBATE..THIS PHONE HANGS, DROPS CALLS, VERY SLOW INTERFACE. IT KEEPS HANGING...I AM GOING TO RETURN IT ASAP!(I ALSO HAVE NOKIA 3650 WHICH IS THE GREATEST PHONE I EVER HAD)"
1,"Another, Misleading BFS Video","Return to Havana? This video barely even talks about Havana. It's more about Cuban music and ""how it is responsible for ALL Latin music around the world."" Not to mention full of SUBJECT statements blaming ALL of Cuba's ills on the USA including changes to Cuban music?... leaving no blame for Bautista. More misleading statements of Cubas history to boot! Uses video footage from the other videos in the set... and fabricated black and white (sepia) footage."
2,My Absolute Favorite Music DVD,"As a big Floyd fan, purchased this out of curiosity. DSotM was not my top PF album, but certainly a favorite. I watched this on a flight and was upset when we started to land because I had to close the laptop! When I got to my hotel, I couldn't do anything before watching the rest of the DVD.The interviews are great. There are discussions with each band member, the engineer and the mixer. Great background conversations and real insight into what Waters was thinking when writing a lot of these songs. If you enjoy Pink Floyd and want a little better understanding on the whys _and_ hows of the making of the album, get this DVD!"
1,"File under Trash, not Thrash","Worst Megadeth album. End of story. Don't waste your money. Get the remastered MD.45-The Craving(with Dave on vocals!) instead. I bought Risk when it first came out and I wanted to cry. If this was the direction they were headed, I would see what Metallica was doing at that time then. Luckily, they got over that creative goof and started putting out the slammin' music again. If you are new to the band, here is your mission:Peace Sells, But Who's BuyingRust in PeaceCryptic WritingsThe World Needs a HeroKilling is my Business and Business is GoodBuy these first and listen to them until they are worn out. Then:The System has FailedYouthanasiaCountdown to ExtinctionAnd:So Far, So Good, So WhatThis last one was when they were all pretty blasted on drugs and basically made the record to support the habit. It shows in the music and the new drummer and guitarist are lousy.Avoid Risk at all costs. Even if it's offered to you for free or given to you by Aunt Fanny at Christmas."
2,Lovely,"I was very pleased with this CD. The songs are lovely that bring forth the season. It reminds me of listening to my mother's old records at Christmas time long ago. A retro feel with that soothing, relaxing vibe."
1,If I wanted to be preached at . . .,"I wish I would have read the one star reviews before purchasing this book. I am very glad I only paid $1 plus shipping.I'm 1/3 into it and I can't even read each paragraph because of the non-stop preaching. If I wanted to be banged with a bible, I'd hang out with my in-laws. Good grief, man, what if I was a buddhist? or Jewish? and I just wanted to read a book that would help me with the subject title???This book is totally obnoxious. The few trinkets of real information are repeated over and over, spread thinly between bible quotes and scriptures. Unless you're looking to get preached at, I would highly advise against this waste of paper and text."
1,"Where's Crib Death, Slug Froma45? ICP you failed me!","A great diservice to a deserving artist. While this had about 12 or 13 good songs on it, I could have did without Jays corny ass interludes. I also felt better songs could have been on here. The best thing about this cd is the album art. I'm giving it a 2 based on the album art and the dozen or so songs that I own on cd anyways."
2,Great game!,"I bought the game as a gift for my boyfriend, who is currently stationed overseas. He really enjoys playing it. The good thing is that it's not so difficult that you need a walkthrough, but not so easy that you get through it too fast."
2,Great hit with my kids!,We bought this for my son and daughter (ages 1 and 3) and they absolutely LOVE it!!! He stands in the corner of my son's room but both children HAVE to go over to pet him and talk to him daily. Wonderfully well made animal...amazing price for such an awesome product. Highly recommend!
2,Glad I bought it,"I'm an avid reader but I was often disappointed with my book choices. I love writers like Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, and Zola. I wanted to find others like them. So far, the authors I have read from Daniel Burt's selections are superior writers as well as writers that I might not have found on my own. I recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading books that have no lasting value."
1,So disapointed,My son received this as a gift and it took 2 adults and glue to put it together! Totally defeats the purpose of having this toy. We found it would not stay together without the glue. The lightest touch would cause the entire thing to collapse. If he hadn't seen the toy out of the box we would have thrown it out or returned it. With all of the initial positive reviews I seriously wonder if there has been a recent redesign from the initial product. Quality of this product is terrible.
2,Great cover!,"I was doubting about buying this cd or not, but finally i decide to buy it, it has only two tracks, but it's still great! It has a different cover from the normal maxi and single (mariah paradise), actually, the cover is the same as the valentine's one. If you're a really mariah fan, you should buy this!"
1,"It's alright, not for faces though.","Used the cream, had a fairly extensive acne breakout after using the product for two weeks. It's a cream, and it can probably serve as a lotion cream, but not for faces. The 5 star ratings are ridiculous on this, and most have only reviewed one product...this one. After reading another buyer's comments, this seems to be a marketing ploy on reviews.....Wish I had known than before I shelled out 35 bucks. I'd move on to Olay or other known brands...There is no miracle wrinkle cream."
1,"Pretty cool but, what about the quality","The Action Replay is a cool game cheat enchacer but it dosen't last anything! This is like the 5th Action Replay i bought it turns blank, it erases codes and everything if they gave this at a bubble gum price for it's duration it will be ok. Overall this is a pretty cool system."
1,Lost in the translation.,This release is a disappointment compared to the spanish language albums. The production tried too hard to sound like a lot of the fabricated teen artists of today. And even though Shakira wrote a lot of the material it is easy to hear that someone held her hand on LAUNDRY SERVICE. It just sounds bland and could be mixed in with a lot of homogenized pop artists.But this is her first English album. Maybe if the sales are high for this one she'll be able to put in her own signiture for the next one. But when you're on TRL you have to mesh in with that sound some how. Let's hope that Shakira doesn't get lost in the soon-to-be teen pop rejects or too late in being a part of the latin craze.
2,Corelle Lifestyles Pewter Dishes--20 pc set,"I ordered the dishes and love the plates and bowls. They are light-weight and don't take up much room in my cabinet. They aren't gray or pewter colored, they're more of a tan to brown color. I like the pattern. I am, however, disappointed in the mugs. They are a great size and look beautiful but are very heavy--approximately 14 ounces each. I have other stoneware mugs about the same size that are much thinner and weigh a lot less, making it easier to hold and drink a full cup of coffee."
1,Might have made a funny short story,"A few pages of interactions with the angel were funny. Other than that, really not worth the paper it's printed on. I really, really wanted something funny. This wasn't it. Old jokes, sad humor, lots of dull sex and weird violence to make you forget the book is worthless. If that's your thing, go ahead and read it. If you'd like something witty, skip this one."
1,pretty but...,"it sure didn't stand up to my henkels( and they're not even the really good ones).. i've used it only a couple times now and tho it's a nice working surface it's already cut to hell.. nice that it's a renewable resource but apparently that means you have to keep buying them.. this will suit the purpose for awhile, and makes a nice serving tray (minus the giant knife gashes) for veggie snack sunday, but i'm going to stop cheaping out on things that look kinda nice and just get myself the butcher block i've been wanting for a long time and that will last for generations.."
1,RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!!!,"Don't waste your money on anything with the Brother name on it. I owned one of the MFC's several years ago and had several issues with ink before I finally spent the ink money on another printer.A year or so ago I bought this machine to use strictly as a fax, lo and behold, same issues just several years later. Brother has an ink racket going on and you're better off spending your money on a Wal Mart house brand."
2,"Great Series, Even better from Amazon in HD!!","THE EPISODE:Without spoiling it for everyone, I think it's a good start to the season, and I'm only but eager to see where they take it ;)THE SERIES:I absolutely love House as a series. It's got the right stuff to keep you coming back each episode, and the good long term story lines to keep you watching through the whole series. Now if only he'd get together with that lady doctor... :)AMAZON HD:I currently have a TivoHD that I watch these on, as well as my computer directly. There're 2 great things to the Amazon HD purchase, they are as follows:- 1) You receive both the SD and HD formats it seems :)- 2) The HD format is GORGEOUS!I'm a fan of the idea that I can also remove the file from my TivoHD (which hasn't had an upgrade disk yet, so I need the space) and re-download it later (up to 2 devices). GREAT WORK AMAZON!"
1,Winsome wood 24 inch stool,"The chair was well constructed, but once you sit in it you will find that the back is too straight and will cause back pain, very disappointed returned all chairs"
1,Great router when it works,I bought this router in Dec 2004. In Jan of Feb of 2005 I had to send it into Bosch because the on off switch only worked sporadically. It worked fine for about a year and I had to send it in again for the same problem. Both times it was fixed under warranty but I still had to pay to ship it to them. Well its broken again same problem it has been acting up since February and has finally quit altogether. Fortunately I have a 20yr old Black and Decker that I paid less that $50.00 for as a spare. It is not nearly as fancy but when I press the start switch it works. I will be looking for a new router but it won't be a Bosch. The one I have now is a $225.00 paper weight.
1,Terrible...,"Ridiculously difficult to use. I bought it to use RPN, and 3D graphing, which it does, but for everything else it is a waste. Unless you know someone who knows how to use it and can show you how, don't buy it. The manual is inadequate, the online .pdf is 900 pages and still doesn't tell you how to do simple things, like solve a linear system of equations. Buy a TI-89."
2,Solid,"This is a solid mill. I was impressed with the craftmanship and it had a nice weight to it. I bought this first, to ""test"" it out before buying the pepper mill. I'm definitely making the additional purchase to finish the set."
2,Two stories in one...,"I really enjoyed this book. Once you begin to read it, most likely you won't want to put it down. The author begins by telling stories of two different people, Porter Washington and Winona Fairchild, with completely different lives but with similar issues. They are both in a major transition period in their lives; most of their battles were internal and somehow the author was able to make them entertaining. By fate, they were able to meet up and the story picked up even more steam. After I read it, I was convinced either the Ms. Robinson knows people such as the ones in the book, or she has the greatest imagination I have ever seen. This is a book where you will make yourself read it from beginning to end just from there being so many twists and turns. So far, I've read two of her books and they have both been top-notch with me."
1,Russell and Norvig Exponentially Better,"The title of this review speeks for itself. Unfortunately I had to buy this book (Nilsson) for a course. I still refer to it at times, but only as a last resort. If you have a choice go with Russell-Norvig text."
2,good stuff.,"this album is really good. its interesting. not boring. the singer has a unique voice. there is a little screaming but not much. id say its a mix of emo and prog rock. ""everything evil"" is my favorite track. if you like sunny day real estate i recomend this album to you."
2,Not bad...Not superb,"This album is MUCH better then the album from 50 cent with Shady Records ""Get Rich or die tryin'"". The fact is...that Obie Trice's able to speak : ) As an overall look I would say that music & rhymes are a lot better than 50 cent's..."
2,Fun With Nuclear Energy,"Katherine Neville is my favorite author for one important reason. Because she deals with hot topics like oil, international finance, and nuclear waste, and she is able to make her stories upbeat, even FUNNY! She tackles hard problems and makes us see the bright side. Though there are those who seem to want to convince us otherwise, I find her books entertaining and inspiring."
2,little miss sure shot,"i enjoy American experience series about characters like Annie,Mary picford,F.D.R. Rockefeller's a lot of persona's you were interested in but never had time to research are presented well in this program and when i was a kid i had such a crush on little miss Oakley after seeing the movie with barbara stanwyck another fave .the series is still being produced and on the older episodes you hear the beautiful musical theme witch cannot be purchased believe me I've tried"
1,At first listen...,"At first listen, I though, WOW, this is gonna be good. But after a little while I saw a pattern of complete fret board nonsense. I thought the tunes like Stella By Starlight were cool, especially Mr. Veasleys intro, but found Mr. Bruno's direction less soloing annoying to listen to. Some of the tunes we're cool and the Tenor Sax had a nice tone but because the focus was on the guitar, I didn't find that part of it (Guitar) very musical. Seems to me he was more interested in seeing how fast he could play."
1,aunt bam's place,This movie was scary and I did not like it. Do better on this because it was not the best
1,English Crossover? DREAM ON!!,"The English song Bailamos is Enrique's awful attempt at trying to crossover, but unfortunately, he does not compare to Ricky Martin. His bad accent and vocals makes his English sound HORRIBLE. The rest of this collection consists of 2 new remixes from his last CD,(which was a major dissapointment) and some old songs from his first 2 CDs."
2,A 13 Year Old's Opinion,"This book is the best in this series. I can relate to Sarah, even though in the beginning of the book she is about 6 years old, and I am 13 years old. The series gives each sister's view of a certain time, happening, and what they think of each other. Some of the best books that I have ever read!!!!!"
1,Poorly bound history book,"The history is nice, but that's something the professor should be interjecting. Also, this book is poorly manufactured. I bought it brand new and several pages had fallen out of the binding just weeks after purchase."
2,A little bit of everything,"Nice compilation of a variety of music, from classical to jazz to blues to French to rock to Indian... perfect for parties. Nothing too ""out there"" and nothing too tame, either."
2,Best Ever Console Racing Game,"If you want to drive a real car. If you want that awesome feeling of screaming past some other driver on the inside line. GT2, and GT1 are as close as you will ever get. DO NOT believe in other driving games until you experience this simulator for yourself. Complex and detailed and real make GT2 ( the follow up to Gran Turismo ) the best driving game to date.And coming from a guy that is 34 and who grew up around arcade driving games such as Pole Position, and super sprint, and Grand National 500....they do not even compare. Get yourself a license and feel the real need for speed."
2,And next week he'll be eighteen,"This very well plotted and very well drawn black-and-white graphic novel is about a couple of young wannabe punks in a retro-futuristic Britain where Hovers are like motorcycles with antigrav plates instead of wheels, where a huge protective dome over a reservoir also provides an enormous recreation area, where the Originals and the Dirt are violently rival gangs not unlike the Mods and the Rockers of the early 1960s. Lel and his black buddy, Bok, make it into the gang and are introduced to drugs as well as the lifestyle they yearn for -- until an encounter with the Dirt gets out of hand. The characterization is quite good, the dialogue is believable, and there's actually a Beginning, a Middle, and an End -- unlike so many graphic novels."
2,Please judge this book by its cover!,"This is a great book about a lady who was a ""sweeper"" back in the 1950's. She managed to keep her family of 10 children afloat by winning prizes from contests. Every $1 win helped with the family finances and the big wins.....the grocery spree ($4,000 with today's dollar value), a new sports car, and $5,000 ($35,000 with today's dollar value.....really helped the family out! I highly recommend this book!"
2,Magnum's Best,"The single from this album - ""Just Like An Arrow"" - brought me into Magnum's world. And what a world ! Storytellers is a fantastic album, both the sound and Rodney Matthews' artwork. More complete than perhaps any other that they've recorded though I would rate ""Sleepwalking"" and ""Rock Art"" as both at least 4 stars... Bob Catley's voice and Tony Clarkin's words create an incredible imagery in your mind - I challenge anyone to listen to ""Les Morts Dansants"" and not picture the soldier shot by his comrades - ""paper square to his heart pinned tight..."" I've been lucky enough to have seen them live at their peak - once at Birmingham Odeon and a couple of times at Birmingham NEC. For a band that was so relatively unsuccessful in sales terms to fill a venue like the NEC was amazing. They're still around, having reformed 3 or so years ago, releasing albums and touring. Go and see them if you get the chance..."
1,Saucony Grid Triumph 3,"I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight. Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line, size twelve and a half. They aren't the same and although the fit is good, they're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead: pricier but considerably better.For God's sake: don't buy runing shoes on-line!"
2,"Work great, but need better sizes","I find these quite helpful, although they would be better if they were a little thicker to provide more cush. Since they need to fit snugly, you won't be able to (or won't want to) remove them. Therefore make a list of the hook colors and sizes as these grippers totally cover the size listed on the grip of most brands of hooks.I am disappointed in the sizing in the package. Some of the little tubes are so close in size as to fit the same size hook just more or less tightly. But there aren't enough sizes to cover let's say all the sizes in a pack of new crochet hooks. SInce I am a newbie, that would be mine.So they do work well, but be prepared to buy more packs to cover all your hooks."
1,A beginning of understanding,"A profound and informed examination of the work of Charles and Ray Eames, written by Ralph Caplan, who not only knew them and worked with them, but also who had the capacity to understand them and to articulate that understanding. Kudos to Ralph Caplan!"
2,Fantastic Show,"Wasn't sure I was going to like this show when I first heard about it, but it's so well done! I will miss it when it ends"
2,need to find a song title and artist name,i was wondering if anyone new the name of the song and the artist name of the song playing when quincey and monica make love for the first time I love the music and can't figure out what its called please e-mail me with the title at sundae7786@aol.com
2,guilty pleasure,"VERY fun game. it also has many interesting features that are never been seen in video games. such as real time. You cant play one week and return the next month. The other townspeople would miss you, people would move out and move in. people would be mad you didnt return your shirt, etc. Also if you screw up, you cant just restart the game. this mole screams at you when you try and return to the game. I was a fan of harvest moon which made me draw myself to this game and this has many features that hm doesnt have that makes it a real guilty pleasure. Oh the hours spent decorating my home.......t_t.. and theres still not enough room for the fishtank.."
2,Good price for a piece of plastic,Worth every penny spent. Works as well as the sto-fen diffuser at a fraction of the cost. Fits my 430ex ii just fine!!!
2,Bought them for my husband and he loves it!,"Great price for such a comfortable pair of indoor slippers. I was wary of another reviewer's comment about the triangular logo that's stitched exactly where the heels will be resting on. But I'm glad my husband said it was perfectly alright and he didn't think of it at all. Since he wears it daily and likes it, I consider it money well spent."
2,Funtionality,"This is an excellent sword. It isn't worth anymore than 40 dollars but, it is still good none the less. The blade is excellent. I have one and it passed the flex test. It is light and easy to swing. There is one major flaw that keeps it from being kicked into the realm of functionality. The handle. It is VERY weak. It has a rat tail tang with all of the weight placed on a somewhat crude weld. If you have some skill in welding and heat treating, you can make this a very awesome sword. It would just be a matter of widening that rat-tail tang (the metal from the blade that extends into the handle) If functionality isn't an issue, then, I would recommend it. Since I love functionality, I only give it 4 stars."
2,Required reading for CEO's!,"""Differentiate or Die"" is a timely masterpiece. Jack Trout gives a comprehensive explanation of what differentiation is, why today's companies must differentiate, and what to consider when developing, implementing and maintaining their differentiating idea. This book reconfirms my assertion that Jack Trout should be required reading for all CEO's and their shareholders."
1,time waster,"Why are most free books about Christianity? I'm so sick of it! This author did it in a very sneaky way. For what it's worth, I will never ever believe your so called god when you do it like this. what a waste of time"
1,Dorman replacement mirrow Chevy truck 2006,"I did not like mirror after replacing ,it shook bad while driving down interstate and moving slowly on my street would not recommend."
1,All Hoax,"The two women were never prisoned by the talliban, that is true. But they were not aid workers like they told you. It is a propaganda from the U.S. They were spies for President Bush to oversee the the destruction of the talliban. But when they were captured, the President want them out and sent soldiers to do his job just for the cause of worthless freedom in America."
2,Outstanding,"THis book is simply outstanding. A must read for anybody that cares about their financial future. Well written, super informative, and exciting reading."
1,Do Not Buy This Game,"This game has not even been released and I can say this to you.Jump to LightSpeed is an expansion for the ground based game called Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. The original game is so bug ridden and unbalanced at the moment and SOE and Lucas Arts are not fixing it at all. In fact they have been lying to us, the paying customers, and are continually pushing back majorly needed bug fixes and revamps. SOE's major rebuttal to all these delays is that it is working on Jump To Light Speed and can't get around to fix the ground game. As we all know of MMORPG's, they all have major bugs at ship. The summary to my review is this.... How can SOE/LucasArts expect to maintain SWG: An Empire Divided and Jump to LightSpeed at the same time?..... They can't.Avoid this game like the plague."
1,Beautiful but NOT FUNNY and TOUCHING as the original movies produced in the 1950s,"These short movies look beautiful and more modern than the original ones produced in the 1950s. However, the old ones are much funnier and more touching.This DVD contains 12 episodes. They are: Accidental Hero, Bully For You, Disarmed and Dangerous, Dragon Quest, Fang Decay, Frankenleftovers, Grimly Day, Opposite Day, Ra-minator, Rich Kid Ra, Scare Day, Weekend at Bunny's.In short, this DVD is worth borrowing but not purchasing.I own the old Casper movies on 4 DVDs. They are titled Best of Casper vol. 1, Best of Casper vol. 2, Casper and Wendy - Scare Up Some Fun, Casper Trick Or Treat. Each contains 12 episodes. The have brought me countless humorous times and warm feeling."
1,Didn't do what I wanted,"I bought it to get rid of tall, thin, wheat-like weeds, but the instructions say it works for weeds with foliage. I sprayed it on them anyway just in case, and now I have a bunch of brown circles in my yard (most of my yard is crabgrass) with the weeds I wanted killed still standing tall. I sprayed it on some other weeds with lots of foliage, and all it did was wilt them a little."
1,Indian on the shelf.,"This is a charming movie with nice special effects, a heartwarming story, and plenty of drama and conflict to keep it interesting for adults and children alike... once.We bought this movie for our kids and they have watched it maybe one or two times. It is a bit long and drags towards the end, making it less than ideal as a ""frequent favorite"", at least in our home.If your kids enjoy cowboys, Indians, or magical fantasy (not the Harry Potter kind, but more along the lines of Neverending Story or Labyrinth), they may get a kick out of it. But I'd be lying if I said this movie was worth the purchase price... it's probably best off as a rental."
2,terracotta,"A must have for anyone with any interest in sculturing the human body. The style is very easy to follow, with near piont by point tips. The technique allow you to move into other media such as the culinary arts of chocholate and butter molding.This bookalong with the other Bruno Lucchesi take pride of place in my library and are constantly used as a ""workshop"" manual"
1,Sardines for sale,"I like spicy food and I like sardines, but I don't like these. I simply cannot finish my pack of 10 cans. I like other Vigo sardines and I wouldn't say these are low quality, but something about the mixture of these strong flavors doesn't work for me. I can taste them for hours."
1,Nancy Drew meets Harriet the Spy in beautiful prose,"Disappointing 500+ pages of gorgeously written but improbable and uninteresting story. Too bad the main character is 12 and named Harriet. I could not suspend my disbelief long enough to believe a 12 year old would engage in most of the activities I read about for hundreds of pages. I kept hoping a real story would emerge amongst the masterfully developed elderly sisters or the split and saddened family of Harriet. After the intense and complex psychology of a Secret History I found the motivations, antics and ""suspense"" of this new book underwhelming and at times formulaic. When she's hiding under a chair we get her view of the floor, if she's in the woods we get a leaf by leaf description, twice we are made aware of the mud rings on the warehouse door - memorable enough the first time to notice them a second time several hundred pages later. If you liked Nancy Drew....."
2,"Classic Cornell discs - American Bird Songs, Vols 1&2 on CD","This is a CD transcription of the first two record sets of bird songs ever recorded and released in this country. Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology created two six-78 rpm album sets (a total of 24 sides) back in the late forties- American Bird Songs, Volume One and American Bird Songs, Volume Two. They translated themselves to lps in the late 1950s, then went out of print, never to appear on cassette and not on cd until now.Each band of about 3.5 minutes each contains a set of three or four birds, identified by Dr. Arthur A. Allen, grand old man of Ornithology at Cornell. I grew up on these and they are a great introduction to bird song for young people. I'm glad they're back.I wish Cornell's other lps (African Bird Songs, Mexican Bird Songs and Songs of Insects)would emerge. In addition to 12 inch lps, they produced a series of 10 inch lps and 78 singles which have also disappeared."
1,Never Again,"I ordered this memory card to be used on a trip to Central America. It worked while I was down there and once I arrived home, I (luckily!) was able to download most of the photos to my computer before the card began to have problems. After trying multiple avenues to try and read the pictures on the card or even to delete or clear the images from the card neither my computer nor my camera are able to read anything on the card. Corruption errors or reformatting requests pop up when I insert it into the computer.By the time I had taken my trip I was at the 30 day mark of when I purchased the card. Lesson learned for me - I won't buy a transcend again nor will I buy it online - too difficult to try and return or get a different version to replace it."
2,Outstanding Book,"I wish there was more publicity on this book. I had watched the show and goggled the show for images and came upon a picture of him before the show and was shocked to see his weight and even more shocked at what he is today. After viewing the sample pages provided by Amazon, I knew I had to grab a copy. I am 10 years older then Frank but he touches the core of my problems. He is an admirable writer that can be respected by all ages. I really appreciate his honesty, sincerity and encouragement. He taps into emotions and experiences that I have yet to see in any book, and for it to target the young generation is phenomenal!! Thanks Frank :)"
1,not space efficient,"You have to put the whole cooler in the freezer...Who has room in their freezer/fridge for that? There is room for 2 large bottles, but i think it would be better to just buy a lunch bag and use it with removable freezer packs that take up less space."
1,AVOID at all costs!!!,"If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
1,Not so good..........,I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like. All I know Is I've stoped.The novel and Movie is really good!BATTLE ROYALE 2 was not that good.Later.........
1,YUCK! DONT READ IT ITS HORRIBLE,this book was soo boring i stopped reading it because the book took forever to get somewhere. WASTE OF TIME!
2,"Bought one for friends, is that good",I had this book for years and bought again to give as gift to friend that wanted to learn to grill better. This book should be in every serious grillers library.
1,BORING....................,"The only reason I bought this game is because it had this so called ""game of the year"" thingy. You can't even attack, whats up with that. I'm a big boy, I can fight for myself I don't need the Xbox doing it for me. After an hour all I got done was making my stupid charater then I found out that you can't attack. Practicly the whole game is talking, talking, talking It's like The Social gathering game gone wrong. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy it. Its a total waste. Da** u Lucas arts."
1,incredible sound with cheap plastic head band,I bought 2 of these in about a year and a half. Mind blowing sound and bass is unreal but they fall apart. I still have them and they sound great if you hold them up to your ears.
2,Love it,"I wish this movie came in single DVD but, alas, it is only available in multiple movie set and I shy away from those. The VHS tape played very well and was great fun. It has been many years since I saw this movie and had forgotten just how good it is. Of course, it's definitely B&W 40s type Hollywoodized stuff but I really enjoyed seeing it again. I've looked at it several times and continue to enjoy the tender love story between these very different people. I don't think I've ever seen Marlena Dietrich in any other movie but I've ordered a set of several others since I liked her in this so much. I guess I always thought she was all accent and smouldering eyes but she was a very good actress and I look forward to seeing the other movies. Weeks later: I see now that Golden Earrings can be purchased in the single DVD and I've ordered it. For all you hopeless romantics who love old movies, don't miss this one. It's one of my absolute favorites."
2,KILL THEM ALL!,"A quote from Johny as they prepare for battle against the bugs. Most people think this movie is nothing but a bunch of people getting chopped into pieces. That isn't the case. This movie is very interesting when you consider the way the world is run (Like a giant military base) and also the characters actually make you feel something for them. Unlike most action movies you really don't care if one of the characters die. They take the time at the starting of the movie to show you what the characters were like before the war and how the war effected them. I'd give this movie 6 stars, one for every time I've seen it. END"
2,"Yet Again, Another Great!!!","This right here is my favorite Cradle of Filth album and is by far their hardest. The songs themselfs have some of the tightest names (i.e. ""Lord Abortion"" and ""Tortured Soul Asylum"") and have some of the best riffs I have ever heard. This album is a must have for Cradle of Filth fans and fans of the genre. Thats really about it, oh yeah, the video for ""Ghost in Her Fog"" [is great]..."
1,"Bad 1970's disco...bad disco? Yes, it's true.",Some rediculously good beats and some stuff that I have to turn off. Meh. I've heard better DJ's. I won't buy another recording from him unless he leaves the 70's alone. I love some 70's disco but the mixes on this album are rough.
2,Heck on Wheels.,"This movie starts out showing that appeasement is wrong and just buys you trouble. The cyclists are repelled from one town by a cop who stands up to them, and then go on to the next place which cottons to them, for a while anyway.There are some good scenes and a few good lines, though. Surely we've all seen clips of Brando's character response to the question, ""What are you rebelling against?"" with the deft reply, ""Whaddya got?""When he starred in this, Lee Marvin wasn't too far out of the WWII Marines, and it shows."
1,Missing a major feature,"I bought this phone because it seemed to have everything at a great price. I've had it for 2 weeks now, and I've noticed some major flaws:1. The phone DOES NOT HAVE speed dial! This is the feature I use most often when making international calls. I can't believe Motorola didn't provide a basic feature like this one.2. The person on the other end cannot hear me on occasion for a few seconds - and I'm less than 10 feet from the base.3. The buttons are really small and hard to press.On the positive side, the phone looks cool and has a lot of other cool features. Motorola just didn't get the basics right with this one."
1,Ended up not using this,"We bought this before talking to our vet, the side effects just weren't worth it. Moral of the story is talk to your vet before you buy anything like this."
2,The Silent World,This is an outstanding book. Bernard E. Branson is an author whose genuine sensitivity to deaf is quite apparent.
1,Very disappointed,"This review is specific to the Bigelow Chinese Oolong TeaAfter drinking this tea several times from whole leaves, I admit I made a mistake in purchasing it as tea bags...even if the product comes in individual packed tea bags and under the Bigelow brand. The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening. The tea bags are nothing like it. It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this. Get it as whole leaves.I will continue drinking this (120 bags @ $16) but I won't enjoy it but winter is coming, I'll have reason to drink tea...or find someone who likes this and give it to them."
1,(yawn),"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Not unlike watching the hundred hour previews before the Oscars or SuperBowl... lots of glitter, much pomp, much applause (especially for old favorites)and a couple of good bits. Best taken in small doses."
2,We can only imagine what it must have been like.,"Capt. McGrath just came to the Air Force Academy for a question and answer session for us cadets. If you have any interest in knowing what true endurance and pain are, or you want to know what war is really like, I advise you to read this book and see the movie Return With Honor."
2,Excellent DVD Player,I am very happy with this DVD player. The pictures that I get on my Westinghouse LVM 42w2 with this DVD player are great. The difference is very noticeable with older movies that are upconverted. I highly recommend this player. I had my father buy one also.
1,The Tragic Cost of Popularity,"It is always such a thrill to hear recordings of top singers early in their careers when their voices are still fresh, energetic, full of flexibility and vitality and the technique is solid. Unfortunately, for some singers, the cost of being at the top is the toll on the voice, managing the impossible performing schedule most top singers confront. This recording sounds like a singer who is vocally exausted. Consequently, the technical care with which Ms. Bonney recorded her first recordings is sadly lacking here. As a voice professor I play samples of Ms. Bonney's earlier recordings as ""what one should do"". With this recording, I now find I am playing examples of ""what one should not do"". I purchased this recording for the value of the unique repertoire. I was terribly disappointed in the execution."
2,Great utility wheel,"Needed to replace cracked plastic hubs on my pressure sprayer. These wheels are better quality than what the OEM supplied.Metal wheels with bearings in hubs. Need about 2"" of shaft for the wheel. You will need some form of shaft attached retainer there is no set screw or other method supplied as part of the wheel. In my case the original design used a collet with a set screw so it was an easy swap of the old wheels for the new. My only question is corrosion resistance in my use case. (power sprayer)Great price and solid product."
1,Could have been good...,This film had great potential (as any film about healing a marriage does). I thought it was going to be deep...but it was mostly just about the couple's sex life in the end. Very disappointing.
1,Answering recording,The recording quality for the ansering feature is very poor. The sound is fuzzy no matter how close or far away you try to record from the speaker.
1,Jason takes Manhattan and the look of the muppets.,"I don't like the whole ""away from Crystal Lake' concept. I want my backwoods psychopath back! Part 8 is descent but it clearly lacks the things that made the originals good and the slasher formula, set by the earliest in the series, is gone. Still Kane's back as Jason and there is a pretty good number of kills. Oh, i almost forgot. Jason has the worst makeup job in this film. He looks like he's crying for the Muppets, but they were on Broadway while he was chasing this girl for no apparent reason."
1,An Unspeakable Travesty,"Every single moment of new footage and new scoring is a raging miscalculation. You're left bewildered, scratching your head, wondering how good-intentioned people could screw up so comprehensively. Get the great Elite edition instead."
1,MTB,"This is terrible,they should suffocate the makers of this ""FILM""What a disaster to see this.MTB will allways be my band.But,with Toy and Tommy."
2,Nice work,This is a good epilator. I owned one of different brand but this seems to be much better. It has different speeds and different heads and this helps to minimize unpleasant feelings as well as to extend period of time when you shouldn't be worried about hairs. I am satisfied.
1,This AC Adapter doesn't work on my Apple Powerbook G3 Pismo,This AC adapter claims to be a Powerbook G3 adapter but there is no evidence. My computer works fine with 2 other adapters but will not work with this adapter. The adapter's own label states that this is a 22 volt power supply which is not equal to the 24 volts provided by real Apple power supplies.
1,"A ""B"" movie at best",I rate this film low (2) because it was disconnected at times and the quality was below the standard of action films that I enjoy. There was a good story line but lost in translation to me through the film. But more sadly was its predicability. I would not recommend this film to a action film enthusiast.
1,Broken After Two Years,"Like other owners, my roommate's Philips 37pf...0A/37 broke after only two years. It worked in the morning and then in the evening, we get a clicking sound, one red blink and then four blinks. Junk. Probably not worth getting fixed and a shame because the picture quality was excellent. We even had a power smoother (?) from Monster."
2,Best one yet,"I have used many different traveling sprinklers since I was a child and this is the best I have ever used. I currently own two, the John Deere which I have owned for 5 months and a Nelson 1865 Raintrain which I have owned for around 7 years. Even after its time in service, the Nelson is performing much better than the JD.I am a former military member and have had to take care of many different lawns and this sprinkler has worked well on all of them. The ability to adjust the speed of the movement and the circumference of the spray has been a lawn saver on many occasions. One of the best things about the Nelson 1865 is its ability to pull long hoses. I currently use a 150 ft hose and it has never slowed the sprinkler or pulled it off track. At the current price, you will never find a better bargain for a poor man's auto sprinkler system. I love this thing so much I have decided to order anther one to replace the John Deere."
2,FROM EAST RIVERSIDE,"LIL SICKO IS THE (MAN) HIS SONGS ARE REALLY COOL, MORE BECAUSE HES FROM EAST RIVERSIDE, CA"
2,"Here's a run for your money, Harry Potter!","I purchased The Lonesome Pine over the internet as it was recommended to me by a friend in the USA. My little daughter has many books but I have never seen anything as original or as inventive as The Lonesome Pine. What Disney did to cartoon fairytales, Ms West has done for children's books. It's the first time I have read a book to Jessie with such excitement in her (and my!) eyes. She was enthralled. It could be read on any level. We couldn't wait to turn the next page! This entertaining story would twist and turn and I had no idea how it was going to end. I have never written a review before, but I was so impressed I felt I had to. I only have one thing to say - Please bring the book to England!"
2,Incredible Story,This story is truly moving and can be appreciated by people with any (or no) horse experience. A very well done documentary - I was sad when it was over.
2,Absolutely adored this show!,I purchased this for my husband last year after he mentioned he used to watch it when he was young. I think I watched the whole series before he got the chance. I absolutely loved the story line and the characters. Too bad television has had to change so much.
2,A masterpiece,"This album represents all the reasons that people love Dream Theater. It is also, in my opinion, their best album to listen to. From beginning to end, it is an enjoyable and dynamic experience. You won't get bored with this one. If you only get one Dream Theater album, this is the one to have. Amazing."
1,A people never truly researched,"I agree with Christina Mayle. I read this book some years ago and feel the author didn't really interview or research thoroughly for himself the people being written about. As far as I'm concerned there is no such group as ""tri racial isolates"". We lived in a community and interacted to an extent with the surrounding community. He makes the people in the book as something out of the ordinary, when most people are more than one race or nationality. I am related to both the Mayle's and the Menerd's.I gave it one star, mainly because it is a book that can be read and people can see how bias others can be. And yes, we are Native American."
2,It's a pretty good book in the series,"According to my 9 year old (who's read the book recently), it's a pretty good book and something she'd like to try someday (staying in a cabin in the snow). As a parent, I've got to say it's nice to still have a few things in life that don't need to be CONSTANTLY monitored for content and to know that this series is one in which good wins out, hard work, persistance, and team work are rewarded, and family is still the most important thing in the world."
2,"Call It An ""Eh"" Relationship","The Good;Works with any mp3 player or any device with a standard headphone jack.Can charge your mp3 player as you are listening to it.The Eh;Sound quality is NOT CD quality. Sounds more like an old tape.You have to turn your mp3 player and radio up pretty loud to get any sound.This transmitter has a really long cord. I'm sure it would be handy for someone, but that person is not me.The Bad;The display is not back lit. Very difficult to use at night."
1,Haven't we been here before?,"Well here we go with some originality. A ""comedy"", or is it a satire, about the Eighties. In my opinion it's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time. I found it's intellectual content to be shallow, acting to be marginial, and it's moralistic overtone to be questionable. First of all why does it require death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of all since when has multiple homicides been humorous? Looking over the reviews I'm not sure what I found to be worse. the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes. Perhaps the real statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction that this movies didn't invoke from people. I dare say we aren't so far removed from the Romans as we may think."
2,Amazing book on money.,"Everyone should read this book.Everyone uses money every day, everyone plans their lives around money in the bank and the value that is determined by money.Everyone should understand money, and there is no better explanation that I have come across for a casual reader or someone with a good understanding of basic economics."
1,Doesn't work with my door either,"The package says it works with Linear garage doors, but it doesn't if they have a smart code buttons. There is no where in the package information that tells you this, but if you work your way through the customer support line it eventually shares it with you. Worthless."
1,"Moderate entertainment, disjointed","I watched this with my boyfriend who wanted this as a birthday gift. He liked it, but he likes almost anything Batman.I don't like the way it was 6 separate stories animated by different people and put together as a single presentation. There wasn't much continutiy at all. I only saw where one story related to the other, though they were supposed to all be congruent.The first of the 6 stories was by far my least favorite. I really disliked the animation style, and the storyline was weakly executed.Honestly, the whole set seemed disorganized and disjointed, and while I was mildly entertained, I certainly wasn't thrilled or going ""wow.""That said, some of the animation is done extremely well and very life-like. I was impressed by that.The MSRP on this is ludicrous, and even the marked-down amazon.com price is more than this DVD is worth to me."
2,GREAT SET OF KIDMAN AND LONDON!,I got this today and it is AWESOME. This is very playable and enjoyable. The attires are very cool. I also dont like the new DELUEX SERIES ONE. Please dont start makig all of them like the deluex seris one. Leave them the way thay are im pegging you because i buy every figure i can find that i dont already have. But i want buy any of the deluex series they bend in two many places and look stupid please leave them the way they are just make them have new and cooler mussels. PLEASE DONT CHANGE THEM.
1,Ramona lacks excitement,"I used this book as a read aloud in my 3rd grade classroom, and to put it bluntly, my students found it to be boring. A lot of the language seemed ""dated."" During Cleary's attempts at humor, I found my students staring at me with ""I don't get it"" looks on their faces. I have found the whole Ramona series to be a little disappointing. A better choice for 3rd graders is the Fudge series by Judy Blume.To put it bluntly, my 3rd graders found this book to be boring. I used this book as a read aloud in my classroom."
1,Pool Leaf Vac,This is the worst pool leaf vac I have ever purchased. Does not work and broke within the first week. Order a better grade or go to a pool supply to get one. Amazon should take this one off their list.
1,I'm dissapointed with the new release!,"I bought a copy of this one two years ago, but unfortunately my son damaged it. He loved it so much I decided to buy it again. I bought the new release of the dvd thinking it was probably better than the original. I was very dissapointed to find out that the language tracks are not available, even though it plainly states it on the back of the dvd case! I love the Baby Einstein series because its a great way to keep Spanish in my child's life. I would not have bought it again if I had known that the language features were no longer available. False advertising!!! If youre gonna do something, do it right or dont do it at all."
1,An oppressive reading experience,"I found this book oppressive -- there were times when I couldn't bring myself to pick it up, yet I couldn't abandon it. I have had this book for over 10 years and am not sure why I decided to read it now. I am so disappointed. It is not well-organized, the narrative bounces around too much, ALL of the characters are horrible and completely unlikeable. I have a feeling that it will be one of the books I always remember, so I cannot completely deny its power, but I do not think it deserves the praise it has gotten. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,I Got Conned,"It's a quirky description and an interesting cover...but the book is terrible. The writing is stilted and amateur and reads more like a barebones outline than a finished and published book. I read better fanfiction on the net anyday.The main character is a spineless, boring girl who I just can't feel sorry for. The rest of the characters are also overdrawn stereotypes without any human characteristics. This book occurs like a movie by a film school director trying to be ""different"".Don't bother. I probably won't even finish it. If you want to try, I'll send it to for the cost of postage."
2,one of the best,"I have to say that Santana is great whatever they play, however the greatest album for me was Moonflower,listen to Europa, Samba Pati,Ill be waiting, what band apart from Santana could ever imagine reaching such musical pleasures for the listeners.....no-one!! I dont think that Santana will beat this one, as for me it has the most emotional music one can listen to, there are a couple of tracks that im not so keen on, dont misunderstand me, they are good,but the rest are brilliant, but you just cannot buy any album with every track 100% hot, but Santana reaches 99.9%Keep going Carlos your fans are with you till the end of your music........there wont be an end though!!!"
2,What's not to like?,"I'm commenting on the four cuts from '53 -- what a great band and what a happy-sounding Miles! Zoot and Al are always a treat to hear and Cohn's four compositions are ear-catching and memorable. Good, solid swinging stuff recalls a more innocent time. I consider the other tracks a nice extra but I think the disc is worth buying just for the four nicely-arranged Cohn originals."
1,A lightweight account of biblical Judaism -- Torah Lite,"The author tries to give an account of the Jews' contributions to civilization -- surely an ambitious task, walking in the footsteps of such giants as Heinrich Graetz or the modern Robert M. Seltzer. What Cahill ends up producing is a collection of Cliff Notes to the Hebrew Bible. He seems to inject some ""authenticity"" to his personal commentary by using the Hebrew names of most of his biblical heros -- although not all. His unfamiliarity with biblical Hebrew leads to some odd etymological speculation -- a delightful diversion for cognescenti, but misleading for everyone else. The reader should beware of any writer who claims to discuss the Hebrew Bible but relies -- like Cahill does -- entirely on a secondary reference work (The Anchor Bible Lexicon) to source his comments. This is a truly annoying book. Two stars are granted strictly for the entertainment value of this otherwise insipid puree."
2,Perfect for Booklets,I like this product because it works great for stapling booklets. The adjustable guide makes sure that each staple is at the same distance from the edge. I would recommend this product to others.
1,Too scary and I'm not a scaredy cat!,"I can't use this thing. Its not easy to use, its loud, and its nearly impossible to see well enough into each follicle, much less hold it there still while you get zapped and it beeps at you. Maybe if someone else was doing it for you...."
2,The Book is GREAT!!!!!!!,"The book is packed with info on all kinds of handgun topics. I learned a great deal about handguns. Like clearing jams, holsters, gun presentation, home defence, ammo and different Cals., specific handguns, choosing a hand gun, and much much more."
1,"So, does it work?","I bought two of these, because I don't have a range right now, and thought it might be nice to cook. Well, not with these.Set on high, the heating element reaches searing heat fairly quickly, and then turns off. As a result, you're left waiting indefinately while the thing decides to turn on again. You can really burn some bacon with it, if you have all day.Case in point, I wrote this review while waiting for the thing to turn back on."
1,Do not order....,"unless you are into antiques. I was so disappointed when I received this book. Not the book itself, but the condition of it. I looked like someone pulled it out of the attic. The pages were dark yellow and the book smelled moldy. I had to turn around and re-order the book, but not from this seller."
1,Limited life,"After 15 months of use the player no longer plays DVDs. It simply displays an error ""H02"" Many others have experienced the same problem and it costs roughly $100 to repair."
2,Definitely a must-see.,"I thought this movie was completely and absolutely bizarre the first time I saw it. Then I proceeded to watch (and comprehend) it a few more times, and saw what a masterpiece it truly is. The soundtrack is spectacular...definitely give this film a try."
1,Farouk Chi Pro GF 1505 Overrated,"Bought this in Jan. 2009 and was quite pleased until this morning when there was no more heat coming out. A blow dryer that only lasts 1 1/4 years, at this price, is not a great investment. It was never used more than a few minutes every few days. Really feel this was not worthwhile for such a short time. It seems others have had this issue too. Would not recommend this dryer."
2,Card Speed Versus Camera write Speed,"I have the canon s45 and this card has worked great with it for the past year. People have to really pay attention the the tech specs of the cameras that they buy, all write speeds are NOT the same for ALL cameras. The size and type of file you shoot can greatly affect the write speed also. Dpreview.com lists hundreds of camera reviews and specs, more than you ever wanted to know about digital cameras. Go there BEFORE you buy, be an INFORMED CONSUMER !!! I see so many complaints about CF cards that have to do with assumptions and not facts. amen."
2,Training for life,"This is a story of abduction, near death, attack, murder, martial arts training and revenge. I found myself thinking of old dubbed martial arts flicks. However, this is the story of Cookie a squirrel. The story seems to be a metaphor for the constant struggles in life and the consequences of your actions. This book is an easy read for children and adults.This story is laden with anecdotes. It contains lessons for all levels of understanding. The main character Cookie is abducted and almost killed. She is befriended by a mouse and the consequences of this are that the mouse is murdered and Cookie seeks revenge. Cookie then studies martial arts. Through this training she gains the fighting techniques for revenge but grows in other aspects of her life and ultimately learns the value of life itself.The story culminates with a final battle in which many die. Selflessness and taking the correct path or making the right decisions are main reoccurring themes."
2,Exercise...Yuck,"Well the video is great and of course Denise Austin is always so bubbly that she makes you want to follow along with her even when you don't want to. I hate exercising but since I know I should, this is a wonderful video to work out to because Denise makes it if not fun at least tolerable. LOL"
1,Not so hot...,"After only a few weeks and fewer than a half dozen washes, the knives appear to be developing rust spots and one has developed some crazy grayish dis-coloring. Thought I was getting a good deal but appear to be cheaply made!"
2,BEST GAME,OMG this is the best game i have played in a while. The graphis are great and it it well owrth the money. I spend hours and hours playing.
2,Care about the school systems?,A must see. Just to get an idea of what is or what may be going on in your school system. Eye opening to say the least. I've watched it twice to gather all info provoded. Seems to be well documented. Powerful in it's outline of public schools in general.
1,madonna can do better,madonna can do better than celine with some singing classes and pls stop the compilation thing!
1,The definition of poorly-written historical fiction,"Poorly written, with wooden characters. The history is there, but the writing quality isn't. Fie on the WSJ reviewer who listed it as a must read -- this was to writing as Kenny G. is to jazz"
2,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"This is the last book in the series - everyone was as good as or better than the first, and that is saying a LOT. The sequel is coming out in September and I can hardly wait to get my hands on it! Diana Gabaldon is a fantastic story teller and I thoroughly love reading her books."
1,disappointed,"I bought this book for my then 15 months old son based on the high percentage of good reviews. But when I received the book I was so disappointed. The pages are thin, the story line is boring (both to my baby and I), and the flaps are too thin and too wide to grab my baby's attention. He looks at it once and almost never picks it up again."
1,Badly printed,"Don't know where the book has been printed, but I think that a book about design, with a lot of images used as reference, should avoid such errors like wrong offsets and dotted prints, making images sometimes unreadeable."
1,It didn't fit!,"The wrench didn't fit the buffer/sander, even though the part number cross-referenced with the Makita website! I'd like to return it for a full refund."
1,Drawing the Mists,"This movie was absolutely the antithesis of everything Bradley wrote in her novel. None of the characters were portrayed accurately and none of the events matched completely with those in the book. Haphazard, the movie is more confusing than ever the closer it comes the the end. Everything become Christian and that is not what happens. Read the book - avoid the movie."
2,lifesaver for people w/pets & allergies,"This is an affordable godsend. I have a son who has to take shots weekly for allergies, 3 cats and a husband who smokes! We bought the Honeywell air purifier and in just a few hours on the day we received it, no one knew my husband was a smoker and I have three cats. he best thing of all, since getting this purifier, my son can now go once a month instead of weekly for an allergy shot because we have taken the ""Dirt"" out of the air he breathes! My dad purchased a $600.00 unit from another company, it worked 4 months and died, now he can't get in touch with the company he bought it from. Thanks Target. Keep up the good work!!"
2,Magic,I loved the dictionary it had all kinds of ways to get to the word I wanted and I could choose any font it was perfect.
2,"Weep not, child","The story concerns itself with an important period in the life of the author's tribe in Kenya in the 1950's - the Mau Mau Emergency at a time when I myself lived in Kenya. It does not pretend to be other than a subjective fictional account and yet is more accurate than the recent supposed historical account by Caroline Elkins, outrageously inaccurate as that is. Ngugi's book goes to the heart of a young boy whose burning desire is to get an education at a time when conflict and killing were all around him. It is beautifully and simply told with a very authentic 'young' voice."
1,DO NOT BUY,I HAVE SEEN THE SIMENS PHONES BEFORE THEY BECOME AVAILABLE IN USA. I LIKED THE WAY THEY LOOKED. WHEN IT WAS MARKETED IN US WE BOUGHT TWO SYSTEMS (ME AND MY BROTHER) MY BROTHER STOPED TRYING TO USE THE PHONE A YEAR AGO AND FINALY I GAVE UP ALSO FOLLOWING IS THE NEGATIVE SIDES OF THIS SYSTEMWORKING RANGE IS VERY SHORT DOES NOT WORK THROUGH MORE THEN ONE WALL TRANSFERING CALLS BETWEEN BASE AND OTHER UNITS ARE COMPLICATED YOU CAN NOT PUT THE CALL ON HOLD AT ONE LOCATION AND PICK-UP FROM ANOTHER LOCATION IN SHORT NOT A USER FREANDLY SYSTEM SHORT BATTERY LIFEBUT GOODLOOKING
1,It is amazing...,... that yet another talentless hobo got published.No stars for this useless edition.
1,Gross is gross,"I ordered Season #1 plus men with brooms offer. Beware...Men with brooms is R rated. Gross is GROSS. The movie is made only for shock value. This is a big let down from the esteemed Canadian Mountie, Benton Fraser."
1,Lots of useless facts,This book had lots of fix it facts but most were common sense or useless.How to get super glue off your fingers.. or how to fix a Casette Tape.Seems like this would NOT be the 1st place to look up something when I need to fix it. Its more of a bathroom reader quailty. You may remember what you read here but I will look elsewhere first.
2,works well; good value,This cam is fine for the price; you get clear pictures; fairly easy to clip to a notebook.
2,Dark Masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece. But it's not for people who are looking for light entertainment. Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, the film may leave you with a feeling that there's no hope left in the world. The battle and massacre scenes at one of the castles are stunning. It's what I imagine Dante's Inferno would look like. And the images of the old lord leaving the burning castle are truly unforgettable.Tatsuya Nakadai plays the lead character, Lord Hidetora. He starred in dozens of movies, many of them classics. But he gives perhaps his finest performance in Ran. It's also worth seeing this movie just to watch Lady Kaede, played by actress Mieko Harada. She is the one person everyone will remember. Kurosawa has a knack for creating female characters who can make their macho samurai husbands look like wimps. If you've ever seen Throne of Blood, then you'll know what I'm talking about. The scene where Kaede finds a bug on the floor is not to be missed."
2,"Applause- Overland Park, KS","This piece of work was ""Excellent""! It had all the makings of great art...it was funny, sad, and thought provoking. As a reader it's important to get a visual picture of what the author is trying to convey...thank you Pam for giving us readers such DETAILS. I can't wait until your next project!"
1,Piece of Junk,"DO NOT BUY!! Blue light is too bright and lights up my bedroom. CD player works terribly and has skipping problems with original cd's and burnt cd's. Sound quality is D at best. Ability to set 2 alarms it a good feature, however don't buy for only that feature. Radio stations will not come in."
2,The Only Book You'll Ever Need,"This book is excellent for new cockatiel owners or a cockatielowner that wants an informative book. I really enjoyed reading it. Covers all the basic's, feeding, housing, colorings, taming all that you'll need to know. I highly recommend it!!!"
1,It seems Kramer also has his personal agenda,It seems Kramer also has his personal agenda. For a more balanced and better evaluation you should turn to Contending Visions of the Middle East : The History and Politics of Orientalism by Zachary Lockman.
1,Can't be used,These are the most worthless pair of headphones that I bought. I am a runner and the sole purpose i bought these headphones was to use them for my runs. Please don't fall for all the positive reviews. I mean these might be good for general purpose use but THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE WORN while RUNNING. You can hardly adjust them. They keep falling off and it takes 10 mins to put them on. USELESS PIECE OF SHIT !!!
2,"Works on my Lexus, I like them","I was missing one cap on my car, so I purchased four new ones. They went on easily and look great. I would definitely buy them again and recommend them."
2,A Good Price,Everything works and after 10 movies I have had no problems. Everyting was ready to go from the box.
2,Just what the title says,"This book is a collection of technical terms, mainly to allow English-speaking instructors to teach deaf pupils. It is conveniently organized into various topics (English/literature, Social Studies, Science, Math, Health, Education, Non-Academics/vocational, and General Vocabulary). It might be less useful in non-educational situations, as many of the signs are ""initialized,"" or variations of more standard signs that have been made with an alphabet handshape to indicate a specific English word. Many deaf people are not English-oriented and would not necessarily be familiar with these signs."
2,Rod Stewart Balladeers again!,"Rod just can't resist it. Since he's into power ballads, Rock has left him for good. Long gone have the days wherein Rod screamed about Hot legs or Tora! Tora! Tora! Out with the Boys. Nowadays he has settled down (new wife and probably new kids underway?) and that suits him just fine. He has discovered that not all artists have to be like Mick and Keith -who will probably die Rockin'- and the style he has committed to is just right. This album definitly proves him right. The fact that he has not contributed any song to this album says something about the man. He has found out that he is not a songwriter, just the singer. No less and no more but at the same time Rod proves why he his right not songwriting: His voice-impact is stronger than ever!! Ballad after ballad brings tears to my eyes; Tears of joy! Sam and Otis have finally found the singer that -like the three tenors- will be remembered for their terrific singing! Hats off mr. Stewart!"
1,"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER","And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
1,Should Have Been Good,"This movie should have been good. It had a great concept and back story to work off of. It had a good cast, except for Josh Hartnett who is the blackhole of movies, and Scarlett Johansen is good in cutey roles and has nice assets but she is not a good dramatic actress in this kind of role. This movie just misses the mark on about every level. The only good thing is that the costumes and the portrayal of the period are both good. But seriously, and I wanted to like it, this movie sucked."
1,Mistake.,"This umbrella is a waste of money and a piece of garbage.I unfortunately lost what seems to be a great umbrella that's just not made anymore and purchased this one. Mistake. I had to re-glue the tips on to the frame of the umbrella in two spots, twice.Would never purchase this brand again.ShedRain. It's the way to go. Lesson learned."
2,Awesome book,Best. book. ever. I love the story line! I really think this book desires a five star rating. Thank Cecil Castellucci for this awesome book!! :)
1,Stacking Up Adobe and Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,"Adobe Photo Album's advantage is its ability to catalog photos. However, I think that more and more people are beginning to look for the ability to organize photos with other files like words and music. For ease of use and ability to link photo with titles, text, songs and songs, the newly release Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook wins hands down.[...]I want software like Adobe to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities. I'm looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use"
2,My Favorite Wife,"Great humor abounds. After his wife is declared dead from missing at sea for 7 years, Grant marries another woman. On the honeymoon he runs into his first wife who has just been rescued from a deserted island she spent with another man for 7 years. The comedy runs amuck in this film.."
2,Best cat toy out there!,"I've been a cat owner for 20 years and have tried just about every toy on the market- I have never seen my cats so enthused over a toy! I first saw it on the Animal Planet TV show My Cat from Hell with Jackson Galaxy cat behaviorist. If he recommends Da Bird, I knew it would be a winner! All of the attachments that were listed came with the package, including the peacock feather. I will say that the other reviewers are correct when they talk about the string- it is very thin and can easily be chewed through. I highly recommend putting the toy away when you are not supervising your cat, both for your pet's safety and for the longevity of the toy. Well worth the money!"
1,Great price - does not quite deliver,"I purchased this printer for my office and have not been happy with it. It is simple to set up, comes at a great price, but unfortunately something is up with the red toner alignment. I've done a couple of calibrations, remove the toner and shake trick, etc. and still I have inconsistent application of toner in the red areas. I cannot recommend this printer."
2,Good work Danzig,"Danzig does some great and powerful work on this album. It is unlinke his usual hard rock / metal / punk CDs, (which I also love) but is awesome nonetheless."
1,Good printer until black stops printing,"WARNING: CHECK THE FORUMS AND GOOGLE (or your preferred search engine) !! There are a ton of complaints out there about the Black ink printing stopping, and there seems to be NO fix (unless the head needs cleaning . . . but that is almost never the problem).Once the black stops printing, hopefully the printer will still be under warranty, and HP may replace it. Otherwise, it is good for holding doors open, but that's about it. I no longer buy HP because of this problem. I should note that others in my family have had some good results with other models, but my C5180 was only good until it was about 6 months out of warranty."
1,"You, sir are the dufus.",I don't know. I don't get it. I would strongly encourage you to spend your pennies on something else.
2,Many many thanks for another profound literary work.,"Harris has done it again is his usual grand manner.Abide With Me, brought some degree of closure to the Invisible Life trilogy. However, I certainly agree with many of the aforementioned comments regarding many intities being unresolved. Although some things were left to be assumed, the book was extremly well written and informative(as well as his previous works).Futher,if Harris chooses to never put pen to paper again, he should at least let us (his loyal fans) know what happens with Yancy and Basil. Now, were those two meat for one another or what?"
2,An eye-opening personal account,"This book offers an interesting look into one woman's search for the meaning and experience of spiritualty. I think the book's layout (chapters devoted to different branches of religion, along with the brief histories of each group given at the start of the chapter) lend's itself to be (mis)interpreted as a non-fiction anthology. At times I felt the book was misinforming, especially on Unitarian Universalism, which is my own leaning. However, in retrospect, I think the author never intended to be an authority. Through this book I saw Catholic practices and rituals in a new light and with renewed inspiration, and had my interest piqued about Sikhs, Mormons, Amish and the Scientologists. I found the writing to be a little too ""pop"" for me at times, and generally like the content of the accounts more than her way of telling about them."
2,Poignant,"When I read this book for a college course two years ago, I couldn't stop crying. True, some aspects of the book might be dated, but the idea that there might be something transcendent beyond the daily facade of ordinary life--and people's striving for it--is still as relevant today as it ever was. And the thought that maybe there is no such transcendence, that Lily fell not because she was unlucky but because the ""perfection"" she was searching for or represented was only ever an illusion, can still bring tears to my eyes. (Sorry this is somewhat incoherent.)"
1,Just a simple fan with a fancy name,"It's nice looking and simple, but cost too much. also kind of noisy."
1,"Difficult, Unsupported","I bought this and installed it as directed. I have two other remote sensing systems from this company that have worked well but this gauge never worked.I think it is DOA. I have followed all of the trouble shooting advice to the letter, bought two sets of new batteries, and emailed tech support. They just emailed the same trouble shooting tips back to me and then went silent.Getting a bad sensor is annoying but having the company that markets it ignore the problem and refuse to back their gear means that I switch to Oregon Scientific."
2,Perfect every time,This book was a lucky find for me. It's difficult to find a book with recipes that turn out well the first time you make them but this book has saved me countless times when cooking for a crowd due to its recipes that are universally enjoyed (sometimes difficult to accomplish with a roomful of guests) and very easy to follow. I think the Strata might be my favorite so far. Highly recommended...
1,Not worth the $s,"Functionally this pasta set is virtually nonfunctional. Does not heat like tri-ply should (30+ minutes on high!), strainer does not sit down near far enough in the pot so water will bubble out all over. Looks pretty, but that is about it, for cooking pasta it is worthless. Spend the extra dollars and get All Clad, you will be thanking me."
2,No problems so far,"Pretty good cassette adapter. For home stereos, make sure the ""this side up"" side is facing the tape window of the stereo. The adapter has 4 cord exit points so you can change it depending on how your car stereo works. The sound is alright. Just keep the tape head clean and you shouldn't have too much distortion. There's a very faint humming noise when nothing is being played but I believe it's my cars stereo [I tried it in another car and the sound is A LOT better with no hums/distortion]. I think this adapter is very good just for MP3 players [or any other non-standard player for the car stereo]. If you wanna play CDs, definitely buy a CD system for the car, it's well worth the investment. Overall, I'm happy with the adapter."
2,"Olivia fans, be on the lookout!!!",">If you're an Olivia Newton-John fan like I am, then you'll be just as excited as I am that this particular album is now available on CD. Her soft, lilting voice carries remarkably well on ""Shaking You"", a masterpiece, yet again, by David Foster. Other such notable artists on this album are Chicago and Boz Scaggs."
2,Action Packed,Action packed from start to finish! Leaves you waning more. Really good movie. Worth renting or buying. Great gift. Loved it.
2,an entertaining book with serious underpinnings,"With ""Streets on Fire"" John Shannon delivers another winning book, as entertaining a read as anything he's done, despite his audacity in throwing some relevant political content into the mix. I have to agree with Charlotte Vale Allen's bewilderment at the vitriol in the PW review--does a genre book have to be witlessly apolitical to be worth a reader's time and effort?"
1,"Great animation, hopeless leads","I have to say I enjoyed it enough a the time, but only because it looked good. But....Kate and Leo looked like mother and son! Neither were particularly appealing or believable (or attractive). It could have been great, but it settled for mainstream, mediocre smaltz. And as for James Cameron at the Oscars.....Gimme a break! King of the world? King of an Ego more like it!"
2,"Not cheap, just inexpensive","This product is really quite good for the price. Sure maybe the battery life could be longer, and the instructions could be clearer as they are written in poor english, but overall this product delivers.It works without flaw with WMP11 also which is good for me. Though one slight drawback is it only holds 99 songs in a folder, so you have to create different folders to make full use of it. Still its far better than creating CD's and lugging around a portable CD player. This fits in my pocket nicely. Plus it has come in handy since my CD player in the car quit working, rather than get a new player for the card, I simply got a cigarette lighter FM transmitter and I'm enjoying my tunes with this little device.Highly recommend if you can to pick one of these up. Its a far better value than any name brand out there for what it can do. Heck it even can do voice recording or simply be used as a thumb drive for transporting other files.What more could you ask for under $50."
2,Not flimsy ike the others I have bought!,"I am impressed with this pouch. I have bought some in the past that were thinner and ripped at the seams within a week or two of use. This one is thicker and more sturdy plastic and the ""zipper"" glides so smooth. I have never been ""locked out"" of my pouch like ones I have had in the past, and no rips, no tears, no discoloration, no problems after MONTHS. I think I have had this for 8-9 months....use it almost daily......and it is wonderful!!!"
2,THAT '70S BAND,"An unpretentious true 'diary' from 70's British glam rocker ( for want of a better description ), Ian Hunter of ""Mott The Hoople"" during his band's successful 1972 tour of the States. He reveals a historically fascinating 'behind the scenes' look at the rock and roll concert circuit of the early '70s, where in Hunter's humble view, sex, drugs, and rock and roll take a back seat to wry observations on American life, a compassion for music, and a compulsion for old guitars found in American junk shops. The reader goes along for the ride as Hunter and the rest of 'Mott The Hoople' tramp across America like kids in an amusement park. Personal revelations and run-ins with a host of rock and roll celebritys give this book an insider's edge and there is a rewarding final entry which finds Hunter questionably inside the high security gates of Elvis Presly's mansion, creeping about like the obsessed fan he reveals himself to be."
2,Read to your babies,"My five-year-old son and I have had great fun with this book for years. The gentle prose is great for reading aloud, and the illustrations, with their many fine-art allusions--to Manet, Seurat, and others--introduce children to cultural heritage in a non-preachy way."
2,thanks,"Thanks you so much!5 stars cuz I love it,once again thanks :)Love this movie/show :)Thanks :)"
1,DISAPPOINTED,The DVD would not play on any of our DVD or BlueRay products. It was not clear when I purchased this that it would not play in Australia.
2,A Thinker,"Excellent, well casted movie. Probably best viewed with someone else so that you can discuss your findings. A movie that needs to be watched more than once inorder to formulate your final conclusion. A real thinker!"
1,$55 for the battery or $129 for the kit!?!?!,"I have the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit and one of the batteries started not holding a charge. So I brought it upstairs to my computer and typed in the model (1234) and found this page. They want $55 for the battery. You can buy the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with TWO of these exact batteries ($110 purchased individually) and that means the charger and drill itself cost $19.That's just stupid.So I bought another kit. Instead of spending $55 for one battery, I spent $129 and now I have TWO drills, THREE good batteries and TWO chargers.In other words, unless you are flat broke, you're better off buying another kit than you are just replacing a bad battery."
2,"Great Product, one minor issue though","Love Maglite flashlights, only had one minor issue with this one. I don't normally write reviews, but wanted to share this for anyone else who has this problem. The flickering/won't turn on problem very well could be the tailcap assembly (screw off back part). There are 2 metal clips that need to make contact with the barrel. If your AA LED Maglite is not turning on, try bending these 2 clips out and make sure they can make contact with the barrel. Mine had this problem, and once I bent these clips out it has worked just great. I hope this helps someone out there."
1,"Hoffman, what happened?","I loved ""Practical Magic"" and ""Turtle Moon"", but this book was such a disappointment. Nothing about how March reacted to Hollis made any sense, beyond her girlhood dreams about what might-have-been. If he'd been waiting for her all his life, he had a funny way of showing it. And nothing that we knew about March would prepare us for how downright silly she is. The man is an abusive creep!Some of the writing was her usual wonderful(The entire first chapter, for example), but I never got over the Kathy/Heathcliff/Wuthering Heights story. There was something ridiculous about them, too. Way too much melodrama, not enough insight."
2,Great Little Item,I bought this for my granddaughter to use on the computers at school. She says it works perfectly and it's a plus that it has a case to keep it free from damage in her backpack. SG
2,Holl@ from Delaware!!!!!,"HOlla!!! the newsies was the best musical ever!!!! i loved it so much! iF you haven't seen it yet, see it right away!! I thought it was unnecassary for the girl to kiss him in the end cuz she hardly saw him the whole movie. and she only sang one line in the whole movie!!!! well besides that, i loved the movie and i am planning on doing it as a show in a few years. well buy the dvd as soon as possible and the soundtrack(you will hear them singing in your head while your sleeping) cyaz!!!"
2,Absolutely Fabulous,"We read this as a family aloud in the evenings. We shut off the TV for a week and we had a blast. This story has it all, suspense, excitement, tragedy, sadness, desperation, triumph. Absolutely great. You will love it."
1,What the heck??,"Ok, I am not even sure what version I have...but it is NOT what I expected! I wanted the regular Rudolph story, instead, I got something with an abominable snow monster that eats reindeer and a mountain man that rips his teeth out?! I wanted some Xmas stories for my 2yr old...this is not what I had in mind. It appears that just about every reviewer received a different book here? Extremely disappointing."
1,Thanks for all the help!!!,"Hello all, and thanks for saving me the money and frustration. I am in the process of waiting for my new Gateway computer to arrive. The salesperson at the store said Studio 8 was the best and easiest to use. He recommended it to me as a ""package"" for $99. So, I said to add it. Now, after reading this review, I am calling the store and canceling this item. I can't believe most reviews are so horrendous. Why is this product even for sale? If it crashes ""once"", it is once too many. We don't drive cars that have brakes fail ""once in a while"". We don't fly in planes more than once that fail.Isn't there a ""merchantability"" law that says an item must perform properly or it is subject to fines? So, thanks for the help, and Pinnacle, if you are listening, which is pretty doubtful, you lost another customer because of these reviews.. Jeff"
2,Great Book,"This book has recipes and complete instructions on how to make candies that I have been wanting to make for years. Some recipes have been tried with great success and I can't wait to try more. I ordered one book for me and another one for my daughter after I saw this book at my daughter-in-law's. This is an older book, but well worth having."
1,What a horrible book!!!,"This subject had such promise! Unfortunately the author turned it into a Harlequin Romance bodice ripper novel about exploited, misunderstood white women who could only find understanding by ""volunteering"" to become the wives of a Native American chief who was hoping to broker a cross cultural understanding by ""marrying"" his family to white women.He perpetuates every stereotype of native americans and the sexual motives of women that have come down through time. Shame on you!! This could have been a fantastic historical novel. I am sorely disappointed!! You have done a disservice to everyone involved."
2,Great book,"I read this book to my 6th grade class, then we listened to a song written about the book. This book is easy for students to understand and has decent illustrations."
1,Aerolatte Deluxe Edition with Stand vs Portable,"I ordered the Aerolatte Stainless-Steel DELUXE Edition Frother with Stand (Chrome) in order to haveit standing handily by my Expresso machine. I had the portable version. The new one has 1/3 thepower that the old portable version has and so it has become almost useless to me.Aerolatte 1 Stainless-Steel Deluxe Edition Frother with Stand, Chrome"
2,very nice,"I haven't seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here, although 12 boxes is a lot. They're great with butter and honey. Haven't tried them with anything else.They're very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out. But they still have a healthy taste."
2,Perfect book for young children (and parents),"If parents need a way to remind their young children (and themselves) of the permanence and transforming power of their love, Rosemary Wells' perfect trilogy is the way. Every detail of this boxed set is perfect, with loving surprises on the end pages and in the art work. The compilation of these stories into one book is nice, but not as appealing as the tiny individual books. Worth finding, even if out of print."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This was a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was more of a reality video and didn't have useful information. In my opinion, it's a video that was put out there to make an easy dollar."
1,Sarah PLain and Tall,"Sarah Plain and Tall was not the most fasinating book to me but you others mite enjoy it.Sarah Plain and Tall by Patricia Maclachlan Tells about Sarah. She has to decide if she wants to stay with Jacob, Caleb, and Anna.To begin, Caleb, and Anna's mom dies after Caleb the youngest was born. Since Anna, Caleb nd Jacob have been grieving. In addition, Jacob sends a letter for a wife and mother for Anna, and Caleb. From their they find Sarah! Lastly, Sarah replies to their request and comes to vist for a month. Sher will decide if she will stay or return home."
1,What Happened in the Transfer?,"Having lived with the VHS version for many years and having used it as an adjunct to my regular jazz teaching routine. I excitedly looked forward to (what I expected to be its great) update into the digital format. Upon receiving the DVD, I sat down to hear it - in what I hoped would be its ultimate form), hit the start button & reeled backed horror. The picture quality was totally degraded, the sound - dreadful - and all I can say is that the manufacturers have done an unspeakable dis-service to one of the great historic and visual masterpieces of jazz history. Avoid the DVD -stick with the VHS until the current producers get their act together."
2,4 and a Half Stars...,"I got Beach Spikers after hearing mixed reviews about it, not sure if I'd love it or hate it. But anyways, I got it, and it's a very nice game. Here's my ratings for each major thing:Graphics- The graphics are very detailed. The player models are very well done, and the minute details, like footprints in the sand, are nice effects. 8.6/10Play Control- There are four buttons on the GameCube for a reason, and Beach Spikers doesn't take advantage of that, but the control is still fairly easy to pick up and understand. 7.9/10Game Design- How many volleyball games are out there? Not many, and this one's chock full of stuff, like a Career Mode and a handful of minigames. 8.2/10Satisfaction- When you're playing the game, you're usually having fun, even when you're losing. That alone is worth a rent. 8.1/10Sound- The sound effects are kinda nice, but an announcer could've added something. 7/10Overall- Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a noteworthy game to at least rent."
2,"Helpful, but not Great",I have enjoyed re-reading Isaiah with the help of this book. It provides good insight and help in understanding some of the difficult passages of Isaiah's writing and combines the Book of Mormon quotes of Isaiah's writing and the changes from Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible to aid in understanding.
2,My son loves it.,My son (age 7) loves this toy. It fits together with four or five others to make a big transformer but can also be played with independently.
1,"Time are tough, stop double dipping","With today's economical woes, you are still willing to screw over people out of their hard earned money? Boo to New Line. Just boo."
2,Slavery By Another Name,Excellent documentary! I was surprised. It is not kind of information you get in school. I highly recommend this DVD.
1,cuisinart schmuisinart,"not worth the trouble. get a small regular one.the drip mechanism for making mayonnaise is especially irratating, spills all over the place. and you have to stand there and hold the key down for the machine to work. dumb. plus it's deafening, a particularly high-pitched scream."
2,Can't understand the problems others are having,"This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke). I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface. It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device. No problems whatsoever. Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either. I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work."
1,It's bad quality,"I bought these dvd's expecting them to be good quality recordings of bad quality films. Instead, I got bad quality recordings period.They seem to be compressed like vcd pirate copies, and every now and again the company's insignia logo comes up at the bottom right hand of the screen for about 30 seconds or so.I was disappointed with the vcd-like quality, and annoyed to be assaulted with logos during the films in this way.Don't buy it."
1,Good While it Lasted,"The balls arrived quickly and were just as they were described. However, the orange one began losing air within the first week and had to be refilled almost daily. Unfortunately, it was completely dead within three weeks. The kids are playing kickball on our blacktop playground, so we need balls that will last longer."
1,Beware! Amazon is selling an unidentified back level version.,"Six weeks after purchasing US Topo National Parks, I called Garmin technical support with a problem. I was informed the version 2 sold to me by Amazon had been upgraded to version 3 in April 2006. Garmin also said they would not upgrade my software to version 3 because I had not paid the MSRP. Since it was over 30 days, Amazon does not provide an return option or upgrade to make this right.With other Garmin products on Amazon's web pages, it is stated that there is a more recent version of the product. This is not the case with Amazon's webpage for the US Topo National Parks. The web page does not identify the version of the mapping software.Buyer Beware !! Amazon is selling a back level version of this mapping software."
2,Seth is an interesting though dense read.,"I have read the Seth material before and found it to be too difficult to follow or maybe the material is just very dense and it was so new to me at the time. Now, twenty years later, it makes perfect sense. For those who are new to this channeled material from Jane Roberts, I recommend Roberts' novel, ""The Education of Oversoul Seven,"" as a starting place. It makes the channeled material much easier to comprehend and to keep straight. In addition, ""Seth Speaks"" is also helpful in understanding this very important philosophy."
1,boring,i didnt read the whole book probably only up to page 80 and it was pretty boring. not very challenging and barely any rising action but i didnt read the whole thing maybe it got better.anyways the 1st 80 pages i read had some boring flashbacks little humor and no vocabulary
1,Present,I was very dissappointed. Bought as a present for an older relative. Letters/numbers too small--programming too difficult.
1,Not recommendable,"Though I appreciate all of Wire's studio-albums from the late 70's to the early 90's, I never liked their live-performances. This is because they often turned their great pop-songs into a dissonant, chaotic goulash of sound. This CD-compilation, recorded at three various locations, Notre Dome Hall, Montreux and Electric Ballroom, is completely unlistenable for ""normal"" people. If any unknown band had served this, nobody would have noticed, but here the critics said:""Oh Wire, this is fabulous art-school-punk!"" You may call the performances on this album ""experimental"", but I really don't know why this gig made such waves. I only give two points, because there are two good studio-recordings thrown in at the end, they're called ""Our swimmer"" and ""Midnight Bahnhof Cafe"". But they're not worth buying this album."
2,Inexpensive and versatile,This tool has been excellent. I needed a drywall/jab saw and bought this tool instead since I figured it would be more useful for other purposes. I've used it for precision cuts of wood in stud bays as well as a drywall saw with just the standard blade and it works great. The only concern I had buying this saw was how tight the blade would fit- the Quik-Lok mechanism is very sturdy and you'd never know you're using a easily replaceable blade.
1,Too abd,Similar to other readers I enjoyed his chapter on Mann's early work. This guy can sure write about a mustasche! Otherwise the story is contrived and in the middle there is all of a sudden an unnecessary [...] montage. I love that word.
2,Gene from Fairfax,"Great Magazine! I love the articles from all over the world about wine, food, and interesting places! Amazon had the best price I have ever found and the service was excellent!"
2,A new Bodeans album with the classic Bodeans sound.,"This Album manages to have the classic Bodans sound while still sounding new. Nothing here that Bodeans fans haven't heard before, but in this case that's a good thing. The Bodeans have a unique sound and they write songs that are a perfect fit to that sound and to eachother. This is definitely an album worth owning!"
2,Hoodrats 2 is a good movie for the times.,"Hoodrats 2: Hoodrats 2 is a good movie that is apropos for the tough times in which we live. The character 'Carla', a free spirited street poet played by Jamie Slaughter, brings positive relief as she offers sound advice to the Hoodrats on how to solidify the neighborhood against an abusive gang leader.I researched this movie and, with the budget and timeframe allotted to shoot Hoodrats 2, the photography was exceptional and the actors believable."
2,Wolfling Review,This is a gorgeous little book for lovers of wolves. Yes it is an older book but the affection between the boy and the wolf is amazing and will touch the heart of animal lovers.
1,Poor design,The way the cover fits into the bottom of the grill means you have to cover this or it will be full of water every time it rains. We've had this nine months and you constantly have to jiggle the control part to keep the thing from shutting off. I've had other Meco electric grills for the past 25 years and they've been great. This one is not.
1,works ok,"Only problem is magnet is almost worthless, which is the whole purpose for a one man job. Otherwise works fine."
1,Deadly Dull!!!!!!!,"Liked the first one am so sorry I spent money on this book. Never Never AGAIN. Who wrote it?Plot is slim to none,writing is boring unless you want to know in great detail ( for no apparent reason) all the buzz words of Canada and US forensic's, nothing ties together, half the time she skipped between the two countries till I never did figure out why or where she was. Never wrote a bad review before, but couldn't resist on this one."
2,The understanding of elements in Tarot,"I like the writing style of Ms. Reed and her understanding of the ""elements"" wand, cup, sword and pentacle. Ms. Cannon switches the sword to the element of fire and the wand to the element of air-- she displays multiple trees of life all depicting various gems, animals, plants, and categorical information pertinent to the ""tree"". It is a book that blends and integrates the concepts of the Tree of Life with serious students of pagan/witchcraft. Excellent book!"
2,The very early years..,"Queen fans know the story but what about the rest of the world ...buy this and find out!!Need i say more, the Band before the hype, working the clubs..the cavern..yes they did play find out more buy this book..10/10"
1,why is it out of stock like FOREVER?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I have been waiting for this book for like 2 weeks and it's still out of stock!!!!! That means I still have to wait for a long time for the book to come because it will take time to ship it after it's IN STOCK. i'm not happy about it at all! I'm a student and I need this book to do homework. If it can be out of stock for TWO WEEKS why do you still put it on the list to let people buy? And then make them wait forever? Amazon, I have to say, this time you really make me disappointed.....!!!"
2,Great product,A sequel to Pillar of Fire which is a historical fiction book set in about 600 BC in Jerusalem. My son and I are enjoying this book. The characters and plot are exciting and it includes explanations of the customs of the time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of that time
2,Exactly Right,"I'm Armenian, and the Ottoman Turks (muslims) murdered 1.5 million Armenian civilians (including members of my family) in 1915, with exactly the mentality that this film explains. For those that want to learn about Islam as it exists in majority muslim countries, this film is for you."
1,Awful iron,"This iron is awful. It is near impossible to get water into the water opening. This is not an exaggeration- I spent 10 minutes trying to get water in and it after 10 minutes, the tank wasn't even 1/10th full. The water just sits on the top and doesn't go down.Luckily, I only spent $5 on this iron and use it as a backup for when my other crappy Black & Decker iron breaks (which occurs on a yearly basis- fortunately, they've been replacing them under warranty)."
1,Useless,"Maybe I haven't given this product enough time to work, but it's been a few weeks now and I can't stand to use it any longer. It doesn't lather, it definitely doesn't keep me from needing to use conditioner, as some people have claimed. It doesn't smell horrible, but it doesn't smell good. My hair just feels weird after I use it, like it's lifeless. If you don't use enough, it doesn't distribute well, and if you use any extra, your hair feels greasy afterward, like it doesn't want to rinse out. Definitely no thickening effect that I can see. I do have very fine hair. I just received a few samples of Redken IntraForce shampoo and toner for thinning color-treated hair. I have only used it on and off about 5 times now, and as soon as I blowdry my hair, I can actually feel that my hair just feels thicker, above the nape of my neck. I will probably buy some bottles of that soon. But this Biotin stuff is a waste of money!"
2,Another good mystery,"If you like Anthony Hopkins & like to solve mysteries, then this is for you. The pace wasn't always as fast as i generally like, but once into the story line, it was intriguing."
2,I love this CD,This CD is a great one. I love A*Teens the are the best. I have liked other bands before but this one really stands out the music is great! I have memorized almost all of their songs! Ilove A*teens!
1,wrong premise,"Normally, I'm a big fan of Grisham, and I must admit that the book is masterfully written. However the various plots just could not exist in the real world. CIA killing an American adviser to the President? NOT going to happen. Additionally, Grisham just doesn't get the conversation inside Washington at the time the book was written. The CIA was fighting for its life against politicization (and failing in several instances). The DIA was constantly entering fabrications into the matrix. The Cheney administration was good at drawing solid lines between imaginary points, using false intelligence vetted by DOD.No, while I normally like Grisham's work, the alleged facts in the book just don't jibe with the real world. I do offer 2 stars to the master storyteller, but he needs to dig a lot deeper to get to reality.Sometimes the truth can be stranger than any fiction."
2,Excellent Movie & Actors,"Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man is a wonderful movie and I enjoyed reading the book. I love how Steve Harvey appears in the movie and encourages the women with his advice. I can't stop watching the movie. The actors are fun to watch as well.They are great actors and paired as couples perfectly."
2,Songs We Learned in Texas,"The lyrics of this CD are fresh, original and clever. The selections also span a variety of genre. Songs We Learned in Texas invites replays without becoming boring."
2,More of a snack mystery for Poirot instead of a full-course meal,"This one is fun, but I found it rather average by Hercule Poirot standards considering how often it shows up on ""best of"" Agatha Christie lists.The framing device she uses here, solving a murder 16 years after the fact, is intriguing because so much of the trail has gone cold for Poirot. He must rely almost entirely on the memories of those who were involved, and that doesn't include the most significant of all witnesses, the accused, because she's been dead for nearly as long."
1,"Huge Reference, But of Very Little Value","This book is huge, at 1344 pages it is huge. But not at all useful. Information is too darn difficult to find, and more often that not it is simply not there. I could not find anything on Dynamic SQL, and very little on SQL Load - something a supposedly 'Complete Reference' of Oracle8 should cover. Also, the absolutely paucity of examples makes it difficult to figure out correct syntactical usage without at least some trial and error. Use one if available at your company or library or if you can borrow a copy - just don't waste money buying one - new or used."
1,Overcouming Obstacles,"Don't WASTE your Money on this!!!! She tries to hypno you way way tooo fast. From the start of the CD to the time that she tries to put you under is less then two minutes. The day that I got the CD I had been up for almost 16 hours and only gotten 3 hours of sleep the night before. Even being that tired, I was not able to get hypno in less then two minutes. I even listen to the CD three more times that night and still could not go under.The other thing is she does not have a calm and soothing voice. It is ruff and crackly.Denmeister"
2,Unbelievably good,"....for several reasons. First, though the main character is a woman, the author is a man - yet you completely believe that a woman is telling this story.Second, Lott's writing style makes it seem as though ""Jewel"" was written in the 1950's - yet, according to the copyright page it was published in 1991. The country was just starting to get into political correctness around that time, and it's hard to believe that a book that uses this sort of language (implied and explicit) could have been written in 1991. But the fact remains that it was - and it's one of the best books I've read so far in 2003.Yes, a good deal of the book is depressing - considering the major plotline it can't help but be depressing. But while not every thread of the story is resolved, there's a lot more positive than negative feelings when you finish the last page.I'm not exactly a fan of Oprah Winfrey's book club, but in ""Jewel"" she picked a winner."
2,RAVE REVIEW,TRINI TRIGGS IS AN UP-COMING STAR. HE HAS REALLY OUTDONE HIMSELF WITH STRAIGHT TEQUILA. HE PUTS SO MUCH FEELING AND SOUL INTO HIS MUSIC. HIS VOICE IS SO ENERGETIC. I THINK THAT STRAIGHT TEQUILA IS ONE OF THE BEST COUNTRY SONGS I'VE HEARD IN A WHILE. I AM SURE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME!
2,Fish feeder for you to get.,We have 2 of this type of feeders they work well with 3mm pellets and flake foods. We also feed 1mm pellets food and we have to keep cleaning it out the gap in the feeder from the auger and bottom is too large and keeps binding up all the time and stop feeding food. I am need of a fix for this. We have liked this feeder over all and would tell you get buy one for you fish tank it has done very well.
2,Great bath toys!,"My daughter was given these toys almost a year ago, and now (at age 27 months), she still loves them! They've been great for her to learn the animal names and noises (well, noises for some of the animals, anyway!), and after watching the animals running around the tub (courtesy of Daddy), she has now learned to make the animals run by herself, along with commentary-- i.e., ""waddle, waddle"" for the penguin. She also recently learned how to fill the animals with water and squirt out the water all by herself. These toys are also very portable and easy to clean, so whether we're going to Grandma's or for a doctor's appointment, I hide a few in the diaper bag so they can surprise her when a little entertainment is needed. I don't clean them in diluted bleach very often, and they still look and smell fine. I highly recommend these cute toys!"
2,Ageless,"I am 60 years old, but because of good genes I look quite a bit younger than my age. When I wear Bare Minerals foundation I find people staring at me - their reason is ""You look amazing. Your skin in absolutely flawless."" My answer to them is ""good genes and Bare Minerals foundation!"""
1,Predictable and Boring,"If you are a soap opera fan, then this may fill the bill. Throw in a meddling mother-in-law, a token lesbian affair, a flirtatious but bewildered husband and a few kids, and there you have it. If you find this movie in the $1.00 bin, then it might be worth buying."
1,Waste of money,"While the printer itself may be relatively cheap, you'll spend so much money on ink that in the long run you'd be better off getting a good laser printer. It seems to run out of ink after only 15-20 pages."
1,Good story but somewhat disjointed,This is a good story about a Navy junior commissioned officer who tangles with a superior officer who was promoted from the NCO ranks which was common in the early years of WWII. The biggest complaint is that there is sometimes a lack of a smooth transition between chapters.
2,My Wife Loved This Book.,My wife collects classic books and anything that is old. She mostly buys to read them but alot of the time she buys them just to decorate and add some old school look to our house. However she has a soft spot for C.S.Lewis. Great book.
1,Vastly disappointed !,"Just finished reading SIN KILLER by McMurtry. I have always enjoyed read his books but was greatly disappointed in his latest endeavor. There seems little if any plot or story line and his attempts at farce fall far short in my mind. If this is an example of the first book of his tetralogy, you can definitely count me out as far as reading any further volumes in this series.The characters in the book don't a semblance of establishing any personality---they are shallow, predictable, and without any substance in my opinion.I'm disappointed in McMurtry and wonder if he is trying to make it on his name and past writings with this current series."
1,Nice Camera BUT Be Aware!,"The Olympus D-520 is a nice camera. Easy to use, nice zoom, sharp photos and the Camedia Master 4.0 software (included) for editing is good and also easy to use. It would be a fine digital camera for a first time buyer. And, very good if you want to take photos and just print them.HOWEVER - You must upgrade to Camedia Pro 4.0 PRO software (online for twenty bucks)to be able to email a photo and there is no way around it. Even with the PRO software you will not be able to email photos if AOL or CompuServe is your ISP. You also must use the upgrade if you want to use ANY OTHER photo editing program. So, please be aware of this, I wasn't."
2,ORO! (GOLD),"Ogni pubblicazione di materiale inedito di Tommy Bolin è per me oro, questo grandissimo musicista ha saputo integrare vari elementi e stili diversi e allo stesso tempo simili, nel suo stile puoi sentire il grande blues, il funky, jazz, fusion, psichedelia, hard rock e altro, è stato un grande genio, meriterebbe molta più considerazione quando si parla dei grandi del rock, ma Tommy andava oltre......"
2,Good book,Great read. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in history. It will definitely keep you engaged and is a good source of knowledge.
1,I'd rather cross the Saraha without sunscreen,This book was the text for one of my intro to programming courses. I had no choice. You do. Run while you can.
1,Gross!,"Ewww! Barbie and My Scene is soo much more apropriate! Like, come on! You don't have to dress so gross to go on a ""Secret Date""!!"
2,Now feel safe working 30 feet up,"Bought this for my super-tall house ladder. Working 30 feet above the ground never felt so secure. Standoff is the perfect size to keep the ladder off of the gutters while putting up Christmas lights. I could finally string lights right past the ladder without moving the ladder! The biggest plus is that the ladder is rock solid once in position. The big con is that, extending a 30 foot ladder with this attached is impossible without a second person due to the topheavy load this puts on the ladder. I'd give it the 5th star if it could somehow be lighter."
2,Good for soap scrubbers too,"I use this for the dish washing wands at my kitchen sink. They drip down into the cup after use instead of all over the sink. Perfect size; I use one side for the plain sponge wand and the other side for the scrubbing wand. Nice and neat. I would give it 5 stars except that after a year I'm noticing a little bit of rust on the bottom. But they're near the sink and getting wet a lot, so this may not happen if you're using it as a spoon rest."
1,Don't waste your dollar.,I plugged this cable into my car stereo and now it only works half the time. My stereo keeps telling me that it cannot read my ipod. Get the real thing instead.
2,great reaf,This was my first read by Hannah Alexander..I loved Hideaway. Every character was great! Good for an afternoon with a good cup of coffee. I will definitely purchase more of this series and surely from Amazon.
1,One of the worst albums that I have listened to.,All of the songs sound the same with no variety. Sounds like he made it in his bathroom.
1,d,"I have had this scooper for about three years now. It was great for about the first 8-12 months, then the coating in the scoop starting to pit. I still use it, since I have not bought anything else. I like how it scoops and the ice cream does not stick too bad to it, but I don't like the pitting of the scoop.I gave it a two, since the finish in the scoop is junk and is coming off. If it was not pitting, I would have given it a 5 star."
1,Unhappy Birdhouse,I was very disappointed with the construction of the birdhouse.It needs to have an opening to clean the house out after the birds nest. The hanger was not sturdy enough to hang. This was broken when I received it.
1,Adding my results to the din of 1000+ voices already heard on this filter,"Frankly, I'm surprised that this filter has so many positive reviews on Amazon. Maybe you can attach it to your lens and the extra glass will help prevent scratches and dings, but it's not going to improve your photographs.A more expensive filter, in the $50 range, will undoubtedly include better UV filtering that will really help you with spots or haze.If you have an expensive lens with fast glass, don't even *think* about this filter. This filter can easily take your paper thin glass down an entire f/stop. You'll need to look in the $100 filter range for optimal aperture operation with your lens.Bottom line - I would not recommend this filter to anyone!"
2,Absolutely enjoyed this story,"Literary masterpiece? Naww.... Well, worth the time to read? You betcha! The characters were just real enough to make the story something to buy into. The author was able to weave an odd tapestry of plot, silly, robots, and an inept human and somehow end up with something that was fun to read. That is the best reason to read this book, it is just plain fun. I want more, so am off to get more of this author's works."
2,Celtic Thunder CD - Light of Other Days,"This CD is from the original Celtic Thunder group. It contains some authentic Celtic songs and if Celtic music is something you enjoy, you will probably like this CD. I would recommend this CD."
1,Disappointed,THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH AN INK ORDER. THIS ONE SENT ME A 26 AND A 17 INSTEAD OF WHAT I ORDERED ALSO THE COLOR CARTRIDGE IS THE PITS. I PRINT A LOT OF PHOTOS AND THESE CARTRIDGES ARE OF VERY POOR QUALITY.
1,"Bad DVD, it want play all the way through the Movie!!!!!!",The DVD will not play the last 3 to 5 minutes of the movie.We back it a couple of frames and again it stops playing.
2,Poems and Pictures,"This book contains three of Elliot's Poems. Growltiger's Last Stand tells the story of the fate of an ornery cat at the hands, er, paws, of Persian and Siamese cats he disdained. It is an amusing tale, although when read today it doesn't always come across as exactly politically correct! The other two poems talk of the feud between the Pekes and the Pollicles, and describe Jellicle cats. All three poems are entertaining and are illustrated with silly pictures that well-suit the tone of the poems. I believe that the book is better suited to slightly older children than the 4 -8 year-old reading level mentioned above."
2,Informative and Inspirational,"Fulton Sheen's Life of Christ is a very informative and inspirational biography of Jesus Christ. Sheen seamlessly weaves together the events from the four Gospels, always emphasizing Christ's mission to suffer and die for our sins, and showing how the cross casts a shadow backwards over all the events of Christ's life. Sheen does get a bit long-winded at times, and has a tendency to repeat the same ideas again and again, but still the excellent content makes this book well worth reading. I would highly recommend this book for all Christians."
2,Peet Glove Dryer,"Great attachment to the peet shoe dryer. with slow heat gloves dry from the inside out, wet snow gloves dry within hours and are toasty warm when going outside."
2,Price increased after adding to wish list,"I was watching this item with the intent to buy and the price increased, so I dropped it. It is just that simple. No big deal"
1,Waste of time and money,"I've been dancing for about 6 years and consider myself to be a fairly good dancer. But this tape offered little to no help. Not only were the rather large female backround dancers annoying they were also discusting. Darrin's feet were cut out of most of the video so you really have no idea what they are doing down there. Another annoying feature were the interviews that graced this dvd. Darrin said that he didn't choose dancing, dancing chose him........well Darrin I'm afraid dancing made a wrong choice. Kiddies don't waste your money!"
2,Stadiums that shine,This book is very well written. The layout is fantastic and the photographs are second to none. I often refer to it when I have friends over. College football fans will love this book.
1,A total waste of time,"This assessment was unanimous within my book club. We decided there was a reason this book is out of print, and it should stay that way. We kept waiting for something to happen. Not only were the characters flat, but the whole story really lead nowhere and was unsatisfying."
1,Nothing Like Gettin Sanduskied!,"Sandusky takes us on a journey of how to create a world based on the theft of boy's innocence. He literally ""touches"" the boys that he works with and even with his mouth. This dirty old man writes about how many lives he has impacted on should I write inserted...............the death penalty is what this creep deserves!"
1,Completely ignored.,"You never know with cats, I guess. But my two rambunctious kittens, who usually loves toys, didn't even look at this. They simply sniffed it and walked away. Even when I started the rocking motion myself, they just ignored it. They did like the box it came in, naturally. I gave this two stars only because it seems to be well-made, sturdy wood contruction like the peekaboo toy box made by the same company, which the cats do love."
1,This thermometer didn't work,I bought this thermometer for my baby but never had a chance to try - it never turned on when unpacked. I didnt bother replacing because not worth the effort... Just bought other brand
2,"Talk about a stud, this guy is the man!","""Got the world on a string.....sitting on a rainbow.....la la la"". Frank glows on these treasures, and so does Nelson's arrangements, which accent perfectly and keep everything swinging happily. These songs will keep you hip and chipper.Frank at his frankiest!"
2,Toffee Is Special,"I received this toffee as a gift. You can't find a better kind of toffee any place. It is delicious, and a very good texture -- not too hard. This is a one of a kind present."
1,A honest review,"I'd like to share the reason for my discontent with this product. I would be highly suspect for any reviewer who gives this item more than three stars afterall, there's a reason the price to this ext hard drive dropped by half. I consider myself moderately capable and computer savvy; however, the installation for this product proved extremely difficult. Windows XP sp2 sets up firewalls that clashes with the installation of this equipment resulting in the infamous ""error 53."" After diabling all of my firewalls, I still was not able to map to the hard drive. I'm not sure how this company could possibly survive with such shotty programming. After much research on numerous message boards, I found that many others had the same issue and readily easy solution was available. The customer service rep is no help as she stated the obvious but did not give a methodology to fix the problem. Also, I can already see the overheat problem that the other reviewers have indicated.Just fyi..cheers"
2,Great as usual,Five for fighting has done it again. This CD is awesome. The single 100 years is true fff music. I only wonder how he keeps coming up with such meaningful songs. They seem to touch me on a level that much music today cannot reach.
2,Yes!,"This CD is IT! I can't get ""Revelaion Sunshine"" out of myyyy... mind. (you'll know what I mean when you buy this disk)."
2,I Dreamed of Africa-- a review,"This book is the type of rare work that draws its readers into a whole other world by making them see and feel everything that the storyteller does. We become almost a part of the life of this extraordinary woman and her passion not only for Kenya and Africa but simply for life and living. Each one of us dreams of some place or ideal as we grow, but few of us are fortunate or determined enough to turn those dreams into realities and go on to live them. Kuki Gallman along with her husband and children shows us what it is like to achieve and live our dreams and at what cost our dreams sometimes come. ""I Dreamed of Africa"" is a lyrical, magical account of one woman, her family, and the people and customs of the last continent in our world that truly has a soul. The message of this book and Kuki's continuing mission to preserve that world will stay with all who read it and they will be better for it."
1,This movie is heartless and it is terrible,The movie is gross obnoxious and far from funny!I feel sorry for the mother having to put up with that demon child who blames her terrible behavior on her imaginary friend. If Fred is supposed to be helping her how is him wreaking havoc helping her or anyone for that matter. If I was the mother found dog poo on my carpet I'd have that brat sent military school. As for Fred he needs to be sent to the blackest void in space!
1,Wanted to love it but...,"This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me."
2,Great book!,"I loved this book. It was a great story. I loved all the fight scenes. I felt like I could not put it down. Plus, the author is very handsome."
2,Illuminating and Informative,"This book is excellent for anyone with a serious interest in Chinese religions. It traces the development of Chinese mystical thought and practice from the earliest mystical and philosophical writings up through the Tang dynasty. In addition to its appeal to the scholarly community, anyone who has read and enjoyed some of the works of Chinese mysticism will find that this book provides a background in which to better understand what they have already read as well as exposing them to works they are not yet familiar with. All in all an excellent read."
1,FOOOOOZZZZZZZZBBBBBBBBBALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,"It was very EDUCATIONAL it taught me the meaning of life. HERE IS THE MEANING OF LIFE: T. O. GOING DEEP, OHH NO WATCH OUT FOR MY GRANDMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Better Invention than the Wheel,Can't recommend this enough if you've got a dog that pulls. I can walk again! Had to watch the dvd to figure out how to put it on my five minues later all my problems were solved.
2,"Thank you, thank you!","This album is brilliant. I don't even know what more I can say about it, except that everyone should own at least one copy of it!I've loved Glen Phillips' music for most of my life, but this might just be his best work yet!If you do nothing else while on this page, give each song a listen."
1,"""Shoeless Joe"" had hard time staying interesting","Like many of the people here, I too had to read this novel for school. Never seeing the movie ""Field of dreams"", I didn't go into it already knowing the ending.'Shoeless Joe' starts off like most novels, kinda slow. Unfortunally this makes the reader think that it will soon start to pick up and become an interesting novel. This is not so. The story drags on yanking the reader in different pointless directions. I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel. I always thought keeping the reader interested was a large part of writing a good novel, apparently I was wrong."
1,Electric fire!,"When it arrived the battery claimed to be fully charged. Plugged in some stuff and popped it back on, it started beeping and powering on and off. Removed items one at a time - and then there were none and it stopped beeping and power cycling. At this point the battery showed completely dead. I left it plugged in to charge. Per the manual it should take up to 16 hours to charge, after 20 it was still only at 60%, an hour later it was down to 54%. I unplugged it and there was a flash from inside the unit and it started smoking. So thanks CyberPower, going back to Opti-UPS, I had two units for almost 5 years before their batteries died... and no fire."
1,No help,"All the great reviews encouraged me to buy this product, but it did not help my mother to sleep better. Too bad."
1,Derivative with subtle homophobia,"It isn't even that much of the elements have been done before by better writers. Or that the few original ideas don't logically track. It's that the author runs a subtle but nonetheless disturbing homophobia through all three novels.(Every time there's any hint whatsoever of some ambiguous character, this person is always repugnant) And yet she seems to have no problems whatsoever with rampant incest. Disturbing."
1,Not for serious readers,"If you truely wish to learn the tarot you must choose a deck that speaks to you and derive your own meanings from them. This book gives you a 'set' responce to each card with no room for personal insights. Also it does deal more with numerology and games, as a reveiwer recently stated, than the real tarot. Some of the spreads, however, have been useful."
2,"Great item, made in America, does the job!","This is a great product by the trusted Norpro company, and it's quite a success. I make soup all the time and this cheesecloth does a great job holding in all of the herbs. Also, I strain coffee grounds for iced coffee, and no grounds have ever made it through. Does fray a bit if you cut it, so just be careful and cut with caution!"
1,Crucial Shipped the Wrong product ... and then messed me around,"I ordered this through Amazon, which passed the correct order onto Crucial. Crucial shipped me DIMM instead of SODIMM. After phoning them and being left on hold for 40 minutes, they:1) refused to acknowledge they had made a mistake (despite the shipping order enclosed with ram providing all the correct order details)2) insisted that I ship the ram back AT MY EXPENSE3) would not ship me the correct ram at the price advertized on Amazon -- they wanted to charge $12 moreAltogether a foul experience. Avoid Crucial!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bootleg CD with half of the tracks,"On this CD you'll only find side A of the original album ""Skin Diver Suite"", side B is not included. Too bad... Plus: It's taken from vinyl, not from the mastertape. I guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip."
1,Digital read out too small for my need,"I got this timer as I needed it for my exercising and needed to watch the seconds count off. The description said the numbers were large (or something to that effect). However, they are not large enough for me; it seems like the numbers on my cell phone are bigger. This timer is great for use in the kitchen, however. Too bad that is not what i purchased it for."
1,Needs better instruction. Or include other items.,"Some people on here said it can only be used on glass. Mine apparently was the opposite. Destroyed the glass on my over $200 cage, burnt my snake, and then melted itself. Came on here to find the issue was probably the cord being ""pinched"", and that some heaters come with a lifter to prevent this. Obviously this one doesn't. The goddamn thing has ""under the tank"" in its name in the company doesn't think to include an item that will keep the pad from melting your pet to death. Add a housing around the cord for Christ sakes, or reinforce it. What a terribly disgusting flaw.I will not buy anything from this company ever again, and will highly recommend against anyone else doing it."
1,Don't shoot the dog. Shoot the author for publishing this book and charging people for it.,"Do NOT waste your money. This book is written like a novel, but it is very, very dry and repetitive. I found nothing in this book that I don't already know, not that I'm a know it all. All the examples are human scenarios, nothing related to dogs and there's nothing in this book that actually says, ""ok, this is how you can train your dog."" No specifics or useful tools to help you, the dog owner, help your dog. Bad, bad book, if there was a negative rating, I'd rate this book a ""-2 stars"""
2,Wonderful!,"This product works amazing! I ended up buying another one for my mom. The ocean and the rain are my favorites. I hate the night sounds (I live in Alaska, hearing crickets is just a strange and annoying NOISE) The rain had a clicking noise every now and again but after using it for a bit when we tried the rain again the noise was gone so it must have been from sitting. My mom's used it so much already I don't know how it's worn out. There are no problems other customers had. Though I imagine with enough constant use I will have problems with it (as expected from everything from cell phones to bedding, nothing lasts forever) Don't let the complainers scare you away because that's all their reviews are- complaints because things don't last forever. :) I think everyone should buy one or two!"
1,Borrrrrinnnggg..........,"I always try to be right there when Susan's books come out but with this one I wished I had been busy that day. I skimmed/skipped vast sections of the book just to get to the end. It was extremely wordy and the erotic parts weren't, well.......erotic. Sexual torture like that isn't very erotic. I never did quite get the whole sister's thing at the end. Must have been in one of the parts that I skimmed/skpped over. Susan, go back and use that red editing pencil on this one."
1,Seat Cushions do nothing comfortable for the rider!,"WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!! I bought this cushion, becasue the seat that came on my cycle was very small for my large bottom! LOL!! I am an amateur cyclist doing alot of MS150 and charity riding. When I started, like everybody I was very saddle sore and thought I needed padding. What people dont realize is experience brings caluses and with that seat cushion, it negates the caluses and also cuts off blood flow. When this happens you then experience numbness and tingling in your lower extremities. Common sense would tell you that that is not a good thing for long distance cycling. Eat you wheaties and tought through it. Also, the cheap drawstring that holds in onto your seat breaks so quicly, that you might as well buy a cushioned ""Granny"" seat before wasting your money that is going to fly off a quarter into any long ride! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!"
2,Fantastic!,"I don't know what magic this pen has - but, it certainly lives up to all the hype. It's really easy to use and makes your face really smooth out and has a luminescent effect.I recommend it highly."
1,CONSUMER WARNING,STILL WISHING GO SEE THIS DVD. I HAVE HAD TO RETURN TWO SHIPMENTS AS DEFECTIVE. I SHALL HOLD OFF UNTIL I CAN BE CERTAIN THAT I CAN PUT ITON MY NON-DEFECTIVE DVD PLAYER AND BE ABLE TO GET PAST THE COPYRIGHTNOTICE.
1,Holiday Towel,"I too thought this was a set and felt deceived by the photo, my fault for not reading more carefully."
2,The Holy Spirit is real...the Bible tells me so.,"So many people either take the Holy Spirit too lightly, in that they would believe that He is not working today, or they go wild and misrepresent what God is truly doing at a specific place and time. Chuck Smith gives the biblical description of the Holy Spirit and how He is moving today, even in and through your life."
2,Very good mixer for the price,I must admit that I did not have high expectations for this mixer for the price. But the unit works very well. I was initially put off by the beaters as they seem very lightweight and flimsy. But they hold up well to use in spite of their lack of heft. I have been very happy with it.
2,so sturdy,"I really like this pan. It is very thick and sturdy, and it is mirror polished. I haven't actually baked with it yet since it is so pretty, but I know that it will last for many years. Because of how sturdy this pan was, I ordered some other Norpro brand pans, and none of the others seems as thick and sturdy as this one- then again, I ordered a lasagna pan and some cookie sheets, so maybe they are supposed to be thinner to allow better heat transfer. All in all, I have made the decision to change to all stainless pans, and I will continue to seek out the Norpro brand."
2,"Does it's Job, WAYYYYY Cheaper than ordering from GE",This Filter is original and is way cheaper than ordering it Direct from GE.... GREAT BUY!!!!
1,to hard to use,hard to set up and use. no directions and can't find anything on the web. Would not buy if I knew this.
2,Cultural literacy thriller,"This book starts out with lots of superfluous description of people and places that never ties up or is relevant to the tale. The story takes quite a bit of time to get off the ground. The story line is textbook predictable. You know who the bad guy(s) are before they are introduced. As they say in the trade ""it is the last person you would suspect.""Now for the positives. After a slow start the action finally starts to move. If you think it has holes that you could fly a jet through, maybe but if it did not you would have no story. One thing people enjoy in books is things they already know about. With Tony Hillerman it is Navaho culture. With Stephen King it is spookiness based on standard premises. This book also bases its suspense on existing conspiracies weaving current events into age-old mysteries.The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"
2,four ghost stories,an older book but still good interesting read for those who love ghost stories and the world of the unknown
2,awsome game,"This game is the best! the graphics are great, and the cars are sweet. I waited for along time for this game and when I got it, it was great. the tracks are the best. it's cool to fly over jumps, and somtimes cars. overall this was a great game"
1,The reception quality is very bad,The reception quality of this phone is very bad. Voice breaks alot even outside building. Other cingular phones work great inside room as well but not this one.
1,Couldn't relate to the pathetic main character,"Perhaps I have difficulty relating to the struggling actor/model/waiter/writer that typifies the main character of this book. Despite the comic backdrop against which this story was written, I found the main character thoroughly unlikable, and thus I dreaded picking up the book every time I set it down."
2,If you love Trains,"I love the Milwaukee Road! And this all about Milwaukee Road Steam, with a plot thrown in, that will make ya cry!"
1,Mahogany - skip it.,"ALthough it looks like a pretty piece, be advised that the back made of two pieces of a cheep material held together with duct tape. This is more MDF covered with veneer than one would expect at this price. The pre-drilled holes do not match up and, as a result, it is difficult to get the magnets to hold the door together appropriately. The cabinet took no less than five hours to assemble. When ours arrived one door was slightly warped - warped enough to make it so the magnets don't hold the door shut. Although the company promptly sent a replacement door, it will be another 30 minutes of work to replace it."
1,"Gross, ugly as sin and twice as nasty.","Some funny bits, but it seems to appeal to our lowest senses. 30 years ago this would have been banned. Now it's common-place - with emphasis on common. Lots of gutter humor."
2,Healing with ki kou,I enjoyed this book very much. It has helped me get a better sense of well being.I feel better physically and emotionally.
2,"A ""detailed"" Pirates game","Very detailed game that should provide a more hard-core and detail oriented person some time-alone fun for many, many hours. Visually exciting with a steep learning curve, this game offers the opposite of the ""Sid Meier's Pirates"" gaming work load. Very hands on and all the small details are on you, the gamer. Avoid the easy-to-aquire cheats: Will ruin the gaming experience. I purchased the game for a low price, so overall good buy."
1,Not much about Eve,"I had high expectations for this book. I love the move ""All About Eve"" and bought the book with the idea that it would have a lot of interesting background on the development of the movie, interaction between the actors, and an analysis of the movie's long appeal. While the book covered these topics, it wasn't with the depth or gravity that I had hoped for. There was a drawn-out ""sub-plot"" about the ""real"" Eve, which seemed superfilious and inconclusive. Those looking for a serious book about a good film won't find it here"
1,what the bleep do we know,I was sent the American version which does not work in Australia. Need to return it for an exchange who do i send it to please.ThanksSue James
2,Rage does it again with this one,"Another smash hit from Rage Aagainst the Machine. Rage stays true to their own style as they put out another album of protest. Though long in the coming, this album is well worth the wait, with songs like Guerrilla Radio and Sleep now in the Fire making listeners remember what it was that made Rage so special in the first place. Thanks guys!"
1,Wrong Item Sent,"The wrong item was sent to me. The item sent is useless to me. They want me to UPS it back to them before they send me the correct item. This means that I have to go out to a UPS store and send it. They should have sent the UPS to my house to pick it up with a tag. They should have sent out the right item no matter what. I paid for the item, I should receive the item I ordered. We are talking a 5.00 item. I am not happy with this merchant at all."
2,Beautiful Flag!,"I put this flag up on my house on Kwanzaa 2012, and posted it's picture on Facebook and all of my friends loved it. It's a great way to show your black pride and help yourself stay grounded!"
1,same problem,"Bought this battery and it is supposed to be new. Charged it completely before using the first time. It only last a few pictures before it goes completely dead. New battery....well, I don't know. Kinda fishy. Needless to say I am still having trouble."
2,Timely Delivery,Product was everything promised and was sent in a very timely manner. will look to use again if needed.
1,WHERE ARE THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS?,"I have bought this product before, and there used to be at least two white chocolate chips per bite. I think there were two in the whole bar this time. Maybe it was a skimpy batch, but i would not buy a case again."
1,Disappointing,"After a strong start, <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i> fizzles into a lame middle section before re-gaining a little strength at the end. Following the near-epic comedy of <i>Dogma</i> and the important comedy of <i>Chasing Amy,</i> you'd think Kevin Smith would be just as successful with a screwball comedy.He's not. Without a framework to hang the jokes on, he has to invent plot contrivances rather than letting the story unfold, and only about a third of the movie really succeeds.On the plus side, the DVD release is primo, with a wealth of additional material to complement the superb audio/video film presentation. All DVDs should be made with this much ambition and value for the buyer."
1,Not Great,"I agree with the other reviewer. Wing nuts won't stay tight, takes too long to put the brush into the unit and to remove the brush from the unit. Too flimsy with a loaded brush, brush flops around making cut-ins very time consuming and, as the other fellow put it, Frustrating!PS I am also a professional painting contractor..."
2,"A little different, but I liked it.","This album is a little bit different than previous hits like CUTS BOTH WAYS or INTO THE LIGHT. At first, I didn't care for it that much, but as I listened to it more the depth of the music and the odd rhythms of some of the songs really grew on me. Now this album is among my favorites.Gloria likes to experiment, and I call this experiment a success!"
1,Garbage!,"I would give this zero stars... but cannot. This product arrived and I installed new batteries and the unit is dead. It's always great to buy a product and have it not work right out of the box. Amazon is great with returns and makes it really easy, the only bright spot with this transaction."
1,grill cover,"This is a very poor quailty for a so called cover,very thin when it get's cold it will crack with a little wind. Maybe buy a different type of cover,material wise, or a little thicker gage of plastic."
1,Not useful for intermediate business needs,"Perhaps this book, written as an extended tutorial, would be useful to absolute beginners or to people who have pretty basic needs. Because it's written as an extended tutorial, it's incredibly tedious, and you're forced to read every word of the prose to get info, and then, it's often not applicable to a broad range of purposes. If you feel relatively confident in this kind of software, I'd recommend going with more of a reference manual (I'll be looking for one next). Especially, if you're a fast learner and are looking to build quickly."
2,My favorite pan,"As soon as I saw this pan here on Amazon.com, I was hoping it would be my favorite pan........and it is. I've never had an ""Everyday"" pan, but it truly is that, and the size and shape are perfect to sit right on my glass-top stove and be out of the way but handy to grab. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I'll come back and edit my review after a few months. I use stainless Cuisinart pans for everything else, but a little non-stick skillet is vital for a quick breakfast sandwich, etc., and I'm used to having to replace them (even the expensive ones) every few months. We'll see how this one holds up."
2,the impossibles-back for the attack,"the impossibles really hit that 97-98 ska sound with this 5 song ep. but its not that usual cookie cutter ska that we all have become so accustomed to. it has a different sound, with some harder, heavier moments, and some really catchy choruses. if you want a great, short cd that gives you a taste of what the impossibles really stood for before the year 2000, this ep is for you. there are some great songs that will definatly give your stereo a run for its money. the first song, Plan B, is possibly the best song that the Impossibles have ever written. actually, it could be one of the best ska songs to come out of that era. if youre a fan of the more recent material, such as songs from Return, or stuff after 2000, you probably wont like this, but its good to get to know where the band's true roots came from. either way, this ep is definatly worth your money, if your a fan of the impossibles, or just a fan of ska in general."
2,20th Anniversary Remade II,"A year later in 1988, Final Fantasy II was released for the Famicom and we never got to experience it until 2003 under Final Fantasy Origins. Well, the PSP version of the game is better than the GBA version and trust me it is the more nervewracking of the two PSP remakes. For one thing, it has a unique way of leveling characters which can prove to be quite innovating for the player. Nonetheless, the game can either be easy or hard depending on how you want to play the game. In my opinion, this game is for those that not only never experience Final Fantasy II or are hardcore fanatics that know what this is all about. Other than that, this is a very good game and regardless I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Nice reading,"It ended before that last pages of the book cause there is some reference stuff back there. It was an interesting book. But I found problems. In the inside-cover, there is a illustration of the floor plan. But that floor plan does not match the outside of the house!?! Which is wrong? I would also like to see more real pictures in it."
1,Return to Midway,We have not recieved our purchase. We initially put the wrong address but that was weeks ago. We should have had the book by now. I am not happy with Amazon.
1,let me down!,I've owned my camera for just over one year...the pictures were great...for about 9 months then the camera started to rewind in the middle of a roll of film...sometimes. I sent it back to Olympus during the warranty period and they returned it but it continued to rewind...I'm giving up and presently using disposables...
2,Nice but expensive projects,"I like the ideas in this book but some of the projects are just too expensive. The first scarf requires you to buy six skeins of Colinette's Point 5 yarn which costs twenty dollars a skein. I think that it's a silly suggestion no matter how easy the big wool is. The book is also hard to keep open while you are trying to knit so you need to use some kind of book weight. It would have been a perfect book to be spiral bound. For the amount of projects it has, the price is right, though."
1,bad idea,I never tried ear cones before. I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't really work. My ear was still full of wax and when I tried to put out the fire as directed it slipped out of my hands and fought the carpet on fire. It left a huge burn Mark on the carpet. This product sucks! I won't be trying it again.
2,Quick Release Skewers,"Had an older bike that I wanted to fix up, this went on great, and I haven't had any problems yet!"
1,Dull and disapointing,"As said in previous review, this book is disapointing when you see how boring it is. Pages and pages related to irrelevant judicial sentences, promotions, etc. It's description of the combat and war crimes are bureaucratic, as describing a mechanical administration. From an academic point of view it is usefull, but only if you are interested in the grey facts or are working on this subject."
1,Worthless,"I've had two sets of Memorex DVD-R discs and no matter what they last a year at best, burned or not. Save yourself alot of headaches and spend an extra $5 dollars on another brand that actually works."
2,Wild Wild West season 4,"I have purchased all 4 seasons that have been released of the tv series The Wild, Wild West. I love the show and the stars. They are neatly packaged and easy to view.I am however extremely disappointed in the lack of special features after the first season was released. Mr. Martin and Mr. Conrad deserve better. As someone who has put about 120$ into the DVD's, I deserve better. Shame on the company that is putting these DVD's together. You owe me a special DVD of extras in my opinion.I think the price is too much for what you receive. Drop the price or increase the extra's."
1,Terrible,"I'm a huge fan of Katherine Heigl and watched this to see her. I was so disappointed! This movie is so bad that it could literally ruin a good actors career. I like movies that start out good, and this one does that, but it goes downhill so fast after the first 20 minutes that it's barely watchable. I almost quit a few times but wanted to see what happened when she found out that she married a killer. It was ridiculous how quickly she took it all in stride, even though at first she acted like she was going to leave him. Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara are MUCH too good for this flop, too. Don't waste your time.And, all those people who are supposedly ""trained killers""? They certainly are terrible shots! When the lead characters are running out in the wide open with machine guns blasting away at them, they don't even get touched. and yet she hits people with one shot even though she's never shot a gun before? Just plain stupid."
1,Damia's Children,I had a hard time listening to this book. The narrater's voice is not one that keeps my attention nor does she have much excitement in her tone while reading. This not one I would recommend.
2,"Great Sound, Great Vocals","I just saw this band play a gig, they blew me away. I know there are a lot of comparisons to other bands etc. I didn't hear it. Personally, I think they have their own sound and it's good."
1,good for a change in routine but complicated and customer service poor,this is good to change up your workout routine but found it difficult to learn the dance routine so could not get a good workout. would be good in a class setting because would be easier to learn. If you are dance inclined it is probably great. I sent an email to her personal website and explaining my situation and asked for some suggestions but never got a response. I feel I spent $60.00 for the 2 dvds and would have loved some feedback. I was hopping the little people in this world mattered but I guess not. All in all if you can spend the time learning the dance it would be good for you but it is hard to find the time to learn.
1,Outdated!,"This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it."
2,Carhartt Jeans,"These jeans fit very well for me. They seem to be very well constructed.I will buy them again. Good price, quick shipping."
1,Leaking mess,"I have had this coffee maker since January 2005 (one year). It has leaked on and off since day one. I replaced it; same thing. It leaks water out the back, out the bottom, and coffee somehow drips down when brewing and burns. The clock also gets condensation on it. My grandmother purchased the same product, and has the same issues."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Device works great..however, there is no updated software that is XP compatable. Customer service told me that they were 'sorry, but the 2100 is no longer a supported product'. They suggested that I purchase a newer model that was XP compatable. Will never buy anything from Sonic Blue again."
2,Awesome module,"I recieved this module for christmas along with my visor platinum. 10 minutes out of the box, i am good to go. the directions couldn't be easier, and the speed of the transfer is incredibly fast. I was debating for a while between this and the other one (Innogear i think). This is obviously the better of the two. It also fits form-factor with the visor, and the innogear does not. i would reccommend this, but also the power clip. That way, after you set up you music, you don't have to drain your visor's batteries. Buy this product now!"
1,Ginseng,"This product did not seem to work for me. In comparing it with other Siberian Ginseng, the one without alcohol worked better. This is about 50% Alcohol."
1,Sharpens unevenly,"This sharpener does not sharpen correctly. After reading the reviews, it is evident that this product is defective, yet the company continues to sell this product. If you use this sharpener, you will waste your pencils since it only sharpens one side of the pencil. I am not pleased with the fact that I have a sharpener that is unusable."
2,Very pleased with this CD,"If you owned the mid 80's VHS ""Nick Heyward Part 1 Featuring Haircut 100 in MilkFilm"" you will probably enjoy this CD. Like the aforementioned VHS, this CD includes four Haircut 100 Tunes ""Fantastic Day, Favorite Shirt, Nobody's Fool,"" and ""Love Plus One."" You also get several of Nick's most popular solo cuts including ""Take That Situation,"" and ""Blue Hat for a Blue Day."" All of the songs are really great and I am pleased with this CD. If you liked the Haircut 100 album ""Pelican West"" then you will probably enjoy Nick's solo work."
2,Veggie Songs to dance by...,I have two young grandkids that love to dance to these songs. One is 18 months old and the other is almost 4 years old. What I love about these songs is that they are also teaching about the Bible and you can never start children to soon.
2,The best filmed version of the two I have seen,"La Traviata on DVD has been released in two versions that I have seen. One was filmed at the Teatro Venice as a stage presentation to a live audiece and it showed.The other is the Placido Domingo version made as a movie with creative use of lighting, and sets. Released now by Universal, my only quibble is the sub-titles which are only accessible as hearing -impaired extras which means additional titles like ""bells ringing"", ""women laughing"" etc.That aside, the movie is as good as Domingo's other effort ""Carmen""."
1,ridiculously difficult to assemble,"This item was described as easy to assemble but after working on it for two days, we had to return it. We called the company twice but all they told us was that they had a lot of complaints regarding assembly and were not nice nor helpful."
1,Anita Blake series is dead...,"If you have any desire for the old Anita Blake, vampire hunter, detective, and animator, then do not get this book. In all of the previous books, there was at least a thread of the detective in the book.The percentage of the books dedicated to the old Anita Blake has steadily declined since Obsidian Butterfly. This book is 5% sex with a new guy, 5% sex with a stranger, 5% do I have a new power or not, and 85% sex with everyone else.After the last book, I commited myself to stop buying this series if the next book did not contain any of the old Anita. I will re-read the books up to Obsidian Butterfly if I need an Anita Blake fix and re-read everything after that if I need an Anita Blake gets sex fix.My only consolation is that I have spent more money on the good Anita Blake books than the bad. This author is now assigned to the list of authors I look for when at a library.:("
2,Easy installation,These headers fit perfectly. The directions supplied with them suggest jacking the motor to install the right side header but this is not necessary. Only took an hour to install. The mounting flanges are heavy and the welding is done well. The finish seems durable too.
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ???,"I DON'T KNOW WHO THE CLOWN IS THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE RECORDING RELEASE OF MICHAEL BUBLE, BUT THE MUSIC PUBLIC IS GOING TO REBEL AGAINST THE PROCESS HE SEMS TO BE USING . THIS LATEST RELEASE ARE SONGS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND RELEASED . I THINK HIS VOICE AND PRESENTATION IS TERRIFIC , BUT ALONG WITH HIS OTHER RELEASES(INCLUDING THE CHRISTMAS ALBUM OF 4 OR 5 SONGS THAT AMAZON SAID""NOT AVAILABLE TILL DEC. 24"" THIS IS A JOKE) I HEARD HIS FIRST RELEASE AND IT WAS GREAT . HIS SECOND( WAS APOLOGIZED FOR BY M.B.) WE SAW HIM IN PERSON AT THE KING CENTER IN MELBOURNE , FLORIDA. THIS IS A GREAT TALENT GONE AWRY BY HIS HANDLERS .J.L.MURRAY"
1,Terrible Switch--Shame on you Linksys,"I have noticed the gradual decline in Linksys product quality over the last couple of years, and this switch is the absolute worst product I have seen yet. We bought this switch for our office to handle a couple of network printers, and over the last two months, two of the ports are comletely dead and a third one is starting to go. What gives? Sorry, but this one is getting exchanged for another vendor's switch...I also have a WRT54G V2 wireless router that does cirles around the new V6 we bought. Not only does the V6 drop connection more often but it has other strange behavior as well. We had a power blip at our remote location and the router totally shut down and rebooted itself into factory default mode. Not to mention that they have downgraded the internal memory, etc. Product support is a joke too. Linksys, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?"
1,Defective product-just a heads-up.,"This is a copy-protected cd. Why is this a problem?a) It can't be copied, even for legally accepted personal use.b) It *will not* play on computer cdrom drives, playstation, dvd players, or many portable car cd players.Basically, it's useless. I received a promo copy that won't even play on my *regular* stereo, which is gathering dust in the spare bedroom. Hm. So, in addition to everything else, it doesn't play on *old* cd players either. As it turns out, Universal will be manufacturing all copies of this title this way, and will be moving ""most"" of its catalog to this format in 2002.This cd *does not* conform to the Red Book Compact Disc audio requirements, and therefore qualifies as a defective product, not even as a cd per se.I have no real interest in ""ripping"" this, as there are only a couple of songs that seem like they might be interesting, but as I listen to all my cds on one of two computers or the PS2, I can't even listen to the thing.Consumer beware."
1,"***** for the movie, ** for the BD-ROM release","Unfortunately the poor execution of 20th Century Fox has wasted my time. This is the 3rd Fox title that I have had to return for a replacement on BD-ROM. Me and the wife enjoyed the movie (luckily the DVD worked) but it's like they say ""Once you go Black you never go back."" Once you go Blu you never go back. Luckily Amazon has an excellent return policy for defective products, but I just got my player 2 months ago and have purchased 100+ titles replacing classics old and new that I had on DVD to Blu. Hopefully I won't have to go through much more of this crap. The Fox library of films includes some excellent titles that I can't wait to be released on BD, I hope they get their disc publisher sorted soon. I can't be the only one with these problems."
1,Wasn't pleased,"I wasn't pleased with this video. I found it had a very lowbudget, which meant distant shots, unknown actors who really couldn'tact, and lighting that was atrocious. In addition, staging was bad,and you had trouble seeing who was talking. It also had nothing to dowith the Mark of the Beast, 666. It's about aleged conspiracy by thegovernment in UFO's. It's hard to follow and understand. I eventhought the video would be good since it's about alleged gov'tconspiracy, but the moderator whined a lot and spoke in a monotone andwhen scenes would show about something, they would only last a secondand then back to the moderator. Don't waste your money or time on thisvideo. YOU WILL REGRET IT if U do. END"
2,Breaks new ground,"Can't understand the controversy, but male readers seem to be the ones most likely to not ""get it"", if that tells you anything. Roc's marketing strategy is also bad, the cover artwork and Carey's endorsement works against this book.This is not light entertainment, but a more literary and cerebral read of thoughtful social commentary. Cross deftly weaves in subtle, understated commentary on not just sex oppression, but that of class and race, as well as the power dynamics of religious and political oppression on us all.As a new writer, it predictably, but occasionally falls down in a few patches, where Cross doesn't quite 'pull it off', but this is a minor criticism of an overall highly talented work by a new writer.My only concern is that this potential talent, will be pressured to deteriorate into sensationalist trashy 'Sex & Violence' in order to sell. Nonetheless I am curious enough to get the second installment. I hope I'm not disappointed, after such a promising start."
2,"Great book, if you can find it","I must have passed this book by many times. When I finally got a copy (back in '91), I was so glad I did. This book focuses on Archers' attack during the opening stages of the battle. The author vividly describes the skirmish that takes place, as well as the impact it had on that day (July 1) and the rest of the battle. While Martin's book ""July 1 1863"" covers this action as well, here in this book a full up review is done. It compare it to Pfanz's detail and Ambrose's readabillity. What ever the avid Gettysburg reader must do to find this book they must."
1,BEWARE OF NORTON SYSTEMWORKS!,"I bought this product in January,just opened the box and nothing, nada. The CD did not work. I contacted Symantec live chat and they refused to replace the CD. Offered to go into my computer and install, but I need a cusom install and said no. The tech 'Sreedevi' said he could do nothing, I asked for the manager, and was told he was out on ""emergency"".I have used Norton for 20 years, but no more. There is no customer support, I am looking for a new utilities company."
2,Gives one a real clue! (Actually 4.5 stars),"This book was the one that unlocked the ""mystery"" of COM for me. I find that it and other WROX beginner books are good when you've read the technobabble of others and still need more of a feel (and examples!). After reading this book, one can go back to the theoretical, intentionally intellectually impressive books for the rest of the story.The only downside was that there were no really detailed C++ examples (e.g., a COM object using another COM object)."
1,I must be missing something...,"As a meditation experience, the DVD might be great. The footage is lovely, the colors muted and luminescent, the monks serene and focused. However, I found the individual sequences far too long. Many of the scenes amounted to not much more than prolonged still shots. And I mean prolonged! After I'd watched a candle flame burn for about five minutes nonstop, I wondered if something was wrong with my DVD player.This glimpse of life inside a French monastery was interesting, but not interesting enough to engage my mind and imagination for the 2+ hours it lasted. The sequence of the monks chanting was so boring as to strain credibility. The audio was lovely, but the video consisted entirely of many minutes of filmed sheet music annotated in Latin. It seemed to go on forever.Cut to about one-fourth its present length, the film would have been a great documentary in my opinion. As it was, I couldn't endure the whole thing."
2,just as good as almost here,"when i first got the almost here album, all the songs sounded the same. Then when i played it a few times and got used to the songs, i loved it. It still is one of my favorite cds. Then Santi came out. I got it and listened to it, and yet again, all the songs sounded similar. i then listened to it more often, and now i like it almost as much as their first. please dont let your first opinion judge the album! it rocks!"
1,Poor quality....broke it within minutes!,"The steamer works that's why it got 2 stars. The attachments are of poor quality and mine broke just as I started doing the floor. I would recommend this for doing tubs, toilets, small things only."
2,Polk Audio Speakers,"I bought these to replace the blown out speakers in my wifes Riviera. The day after I received these speakers, the car was totaled in an accident. When I received these speakers, however, I noticed that they were ""Marine grade"" speakers. Keep this in mind. Now I was also planning on putting additional speakers in my boat. So guess what? These Polk Audio speakers will be installed in my boat before spring time. Therefore, I'm keeping these speakers, I haven't heard them yet. But they are POLK AUDIO, they are marine grade and they will fit in my boat. In the summer I can update this on how they sound."
2,An interresting book to read,"If you are one of those who likes guns, hunting and target shooting, then you're bound to like this book. Why, because it's written by people who know these things first hand, and have military knowledge and background."
2,Ives seems to have bought the farm.,"For a mystery book, this novel fails at every turn. The main character, a young boy named Charlie, begins his life growing up on a farm where his father attacks him with terrible non-harmonies and atrocities music was never intended to produce. Soon, Charlie is swept up by the idea that music need not to sound pretty, and that life be filled with hesitance and incompletion. This novel falls short when it start to focus, only a few pages in, on Charlie's Second Piano Sonata. Why the auther chose this, the most unanticipated work since Garfunkel's ""Songs From a Parent to a Child"", on which to base a story of suspense is beyond me. The most disappointing point to all of this is that Geoffrey Block, a man with so promising a name, could fall so far from genius. Don't let his IQ fool you."
1,Boring and potentially dangerous.,"What is the fascination with fasting, in the u.s. especially? How about a properly balanced diet with exercise than trying to fix things asap in the easiest way possible. I was waiting for Ron Popiel to jump out at the end with a special offer on a juicer. Not inspiring to anyone with common sense. Sorry, but drinking juice is not a magic cure-all. Stop stuffing your face with burgers and corn syrup and exercise once in a while."
2,CanoScan 8400F=Fantastic!,I ordered this Cannon scanner and got it the Next Day! That may have just been because of where I lived but what a pleasent surprize. It worked perfect and I got it cheap. Great job Amazon!
2,good buy,Save you time and money by not having to go to a store or through xbox live which is reguarly priced. Awesome grab. The only thing is missing is that is should get cheaper and cheaper until you pay little.
1,What's love got to do with it?,That's how I felt about this book. There was no love involved between any of the characters. It was more of an obsession and lust than the need to love and be loved. I felt that Samone was lacking as a character. The author concentrated more on complicating the plot rather than develop the characters mindset. I was greatly disappointed in this book.
1,Frustrating,Wonderful classic songs sung by an historic group but recorded in very low fi. The sound quality reminds me of recordings made in the twenties or music played through the speakers on my netbook.
2,i'm no expert but...,i was given a copy of this cd (copied from a record) by a friend. unfortunately all i know is that it is a compilation of japanese dj/producers/artists journeys with world music. awesome beats and intriguing vocals add up to an album that is worth every cent that you paid for it... if you are a fan of recordings from the label 'spiritual life' joe causell et al. you are thoroughly in need of this musical adventure. enjoy the arual pleasure that is the 'bananna connection'. full apologies for not being more knowledgable of artists/contributors etc.
2,An excellent intro to the game of chess,"Chess in a Nutshell is a concise and readable introduction to chess. It deals with the very basics before giving the reader a taste of some of the most common opening moves and basic strategies. Chess is by no means a game that one can learn overnight, and one should not expect to become a Bobby Fischer after reading Chess in a Nutshell, but it is no doubt one of the best books out there for the beginner."
2,Put the same old stuff away and pick up something fresh!,You am I is a band made up of 3 ordinary Aussie blokes who know how to make addictive music. Hourly Daily has everything from accoustic ballads to driving guitars. The lyrics are fun with some typical Aussie sarcasm. I recommend you add this to your music collection - you will not regret it.
1,The Descendants DVD,I bought this on the recommendation of my cousin. I wish I had listened to my own instincts and saved the money.
1,Huh?,"This was a weak book. Weak story, weak plot, even the cover was weak. How corny can a leather and black story be? It's totally outdated."
2,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy,",All my cats love this! We have seven. Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy is sturdy and heavy duty. The scratch area is a win with they also.
1,Wow...shockingly bad movie,"I watched this movie and I don't review things very often but felt a need to save others from wasting two hours of their life watching this movie. This is one of the worst movies I have seen...painful...absolutely painful. Writing, acting, Directing all are some of the worst I have seen in a wide release movie."
2,Aaliyah you will be missed,i love aaliyah & her music this cd is one of the best she have made i will miss you and your music dearly!!!
2,Substantial amount,I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic. It works great. I would definitely buy this again. The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand. It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end.
1,Mistake on my part,"This might be a good buy for an established vegetarian, but not for someone who wants to add more vegetables to their diet. A lot of recipies call for many (up to 10) ingredients, some of which are not commonly used. Why should I buy rice vinegar, cider vinegar, buckwheat flour, or something called tahini just to try it in one recipe. I am not saying the recipes are bad, they just look intimidating."
1,Wasn't what I expected,I have tried the series of 4 other videos I love the energy I recieved from working out with the video. I purchaced this video and was extremly disappointed with it I was expecting some thing more along the lines of the other videos. How can I get a refund. Andrea
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Once again Don Warnner of Rising Sun Productions DECEIVES the buyer,the cover states iaido and shows a prominent Sensei of Toyama Ryu, Seiji Ueki Sensei all over the cover and disc itself,BUT NOWHERE AND ,I REPEAT NOWHERE DOES UEKI SENSEI APPEAR IN THIS VIDEO ,OR IS THER ANY INSTRUCTION IN CLASICAL IAIDO !!,This is just poor management of a company and an effort to deceive to make sales, very sad indeed.In my opinion mr. Warnner is a man of no Budo and misrepresents to make a buck! THIS IS JUST A COPY OF NIHON KENDO KATA !!! BUY THAT INSTEAD !!!Although the video itself is great for the material it contains , it should have been marketed acurately, VERY SAD don VERY sad!>>>>>"
1,Never delivered,"I patiently awaited this CD for over 3 1/2 weeks. When I finally got a inqury from Amazon, I emailed the vendor immediately. He was supposed to refund my money and I still haven't seen it. Bad customer service."
1,ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PAYING MORE FOR A CHEAPER PRODUCT!,"I have an older Petmate Carrier exactly like this PetMate 21277 Kennel Cab I just bought. The older carrier is a MEDIUM sized carrier that's probably 6-7 years old. It's sturdy and the plastic is thicker and much firmer than this one I just bought. The new carrier I just received was advertised as ""large"". It is not! It's the same size as my old one. This is another example of how American manufacturers are making huge profits at the expense of the consumer. They raise the price on their products and at the same time make them out of much cheaper materials. Their bottom line comes out just great. My bottom line? I'm $34 poorer with a product that doesn't work!! This carrier is useless, made of flimsy, cheap plastic. The carrier won't stay together as it's constructed. I'm not going thru the trouble of trying to return this abomination. I'll try to jerry-rig it to work. This purchase makes me NOT likely to buy any more products from Amazon."
2,Songs of Peace and Gentle Grattitude,"This is Fr. Peter Bowes' third CD and it is just as beautiful and moving as the first two albums. Fr. Peter's message is a simple one; open your heart to God's Love and to the Light of Jesus and Mary. His style is a gentle, folky accoustic sound with some songs featuring the traditional rock/blues setup of electric and bass guitars, drums and sometimes traditional instruments like flute and cello. One can hear the influences of artists like Bob Dylan, Peter Paul and Mary, Simon and Garfunkel and other great folk musicians of past and present. Of course, Fr. Peter's deepest inspiration goes far beyond any musical artist. His greatest love is for the Divine Composer of this Universe, of this world and of our souls."
2,"An excellent resource for kids, parents, and teachers","This is an excellent resource for bright and gifted children. The author indicates that it is for ages 10 and under, and I would suggest using it with a child as soon as the child is old enough to comprehend the issues even is he/she cannot yet read it all.The book has excellent tips and questions for the child to think about and is a great starter for conversations between the parent and child. As an educator, I think this book would be a great classroom reader to use in a small group with talented/bright/gifted kids so that they can have the conversations with each otherThe book also talks about how kids can manage the teasing from others, the lack of understanding from teachers and adults, and in general their own self worth."
1,what happened to workmanship,"this was an inexpensive product but it does carry the Proctor Silex name first use the glue holding the grinder button caused the grinder button to fall off...it was not expensive, however, so...go for the higher quality, albeit more expensive quality."
2,It student software. What do you want from me?,"Endnot X (i.e. version 10)Useful tool if you write a lot of MLA, APA, IEEE style papers. I'm not sure what all it will do... I mostly use it to make sure my references are correct. Work pretty well. It has problems distinguishing between first and last names... so you have to do a little editing."
1,5 Stars for the bonus ambient disc,"I think fans have to be honest about Hotel: It is a disappointing effort. The album begins with great promise. The intro is an excellent, subtle, synth piece. It suits the sterile, soft colours used in the cd art. From there the album drops off. Moby isn't much of a guitar player-so a near whole album of ""post-punk""-ish pop tunes is hard to enjoy. ""I like it"" is particularly bad. There are some bright spots. ""Raining Again"" and ""Lift Me up"" are passable. The cover of New Order's ""Temptation"" with singer Dawn is actually fairly good. The album ends well with some nice ambient compositions. ""Homeward Angel"" is excellent.If you can find a copy with the bonus ambient cd, buy it. The second disc is unapologetically electronic, slow, long, and beautiful. It is one for the fans and more than makes up for the short-comings of the first disc."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"This album sounds like it was recorded under the worst possible conditions. From what I can hear of the music, I imagine this would have been awesome if it was listenable. It isn't. It sounds as if it was recorded over a telephone wire. Awful awful, awful. ONLY get this after you get all the other VdGG albums. And maybe not even then. I no longer have this one, and I don't plan on re-purchasing this headache. And that's coming from a seasoned VdGG fanatic."
1,Dry,"This is one of the most dry and boring textbooks I've had to read. The only textbook more boring than this one, that I can remember, was an anatomy book. I have a strong interest in psychology, so for me to find a psychology book to be boring, it must be pretty bad."
2,Fantastic Movie,"This is a wonderful movie. Mr. Bernabo, in his review was wrong about a few details. Firstly, this movie takes place in upstate New York, not Mass. Secondly, the reunion is in January, not February. However, this move IS about real people and I like that it doesn't have that ""happy Hollywood ending"" thing. It is one of my all time favs. Enjoy."
2,Awesome,"The CD is awesome, and Stephen Schwartz is a genius. There's no doubt whatsoever that the music from 'Wicked' is delightful to listen, and that Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth rock.I was very pleased to receive the product completely scratchless, in less time than estimated."
2,Nice looking,"Unfortunately I bought this item 1 size smaller. Ive gain some weight, next time I will go for m size. I wore it and it looks awesome! Very confortable."
2,Quality product,"I ordered this magnifier to replace my plastic Ott lamp that snapped off at the neck. There's a big difference in the quality of the lens and the total weight of the lamp, all in favor of the Fulcrum. Add in the fact that's it's smaller, more flexible and classier looking. Great product for the price."
2,One of the best (I think THE best) TV Series ever,"Wild Wild West had something that has never been seen before or since. As is proven by it's enormous popularity 40 years later. Finally, it has been released in a box set, at least season one has, and in three days has rocketed to #1 seller. I've already bought two sets from Amazon, and there are a lot of people who are going to get this from me as a present. I can hardly wait for seasons 2, 3 and 4 to come out in this same format.The interviews, commentary, and all the other wonderful extras are why so many of us that have it in other forms have pounced on this set. Robert Conrad does audio commentary for every episode, and its so wonderful.Recommended buy. Incredible show, incredible packaging of same."
1,He Tried,"Handling this Da Vinci Code issue is tricky. One must find the right balance of response, rebuttle, commentary, and fact-offering. Sadly, Lunn missed the mark. Here's why.What other books has Martin Lunn writtern?-none. And it shows. The guy clearly knows a lot about history, but when it comes to getting his point across, his rookie status as a writer really shows. Also, Lunn doesn't seem able to grasp what the average reader (a.k.a. Dan Brown fan) really wants to know. More than anything else, I felt like I was reading a tour guide to Europe when I read this book, instead of reading a real thoughtful response to Brown's bestseller. This may be because Lunn lives in Barcelona.The book's PR description says Lunn's volume ""provides an exhaustive tour of the locations visited by the novel's characters."" Very true-I was exhausted by reading the book. I would rather have closed the last page enlightened with a few really interesting facts on which to hang my thoughts."
2,"Not the best, but very good.","Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are ""Fences"", ""Misery Business"", and ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were ""When It Rains"" and ""Let The Flames Begin."" ""When It Rains"" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And ""Let The Flames Begin"" is basically a crappy version of ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it."
1,Venus-Peter O'Toole as a Dirty Old Man Out of Control,I think I can be brief with this review as I don't wish to spend too much time or emotion over it. The story is a pathetic romp through the mud and I can't believe that O'Toole would permit himself to portray a dirty old man in heat.Those of you who are long time fans of O'Toole would probably do well to avoid this film as I have been an admirer of his work for my entire life and felt badly for him after viewing it.Those Amazon reviewers awarding 3 stars or less to this movie agree with me and I don't give a dam what Hollywood said about this film.
1,Flimsy! Should be made of metal.,"This item is perfect for what we want to do: neatly collect empty hangers from the closet and carry them to the laundry room for reuse.But other reviewers are right, it breaks quickly, even with careful use.If it were made of metal, or a less fragile design, we'd give it FIVE stars.As is: JUNK."
1,I Am Not,"Really quite awful. Mostly it got my attention because it incorporates music from various of John Adams' orchestral compositions. Now that I have sat through this bland drama, I am shocked that the composer consented to this appropriation. And the torrent of praise given this film, from even our most insightful professional critics, confirms simply that a tale about a woman who feels trapped but escapes in the end will milk, without fail, any faux-progressive's heart (like auditing coursework from a women's studies program). This is basically a second-rate revival of Tilda Swinton's early feminist film ""Orlando"" in a rather different era and with much less subtlety. The cinematography aspires toward epic luxury but basically conveys a lazy, digital aesthetic with awkward coverage shots and uninventive tracking shots. As a low-budget film, ""I Am Love"" needn't have bothered trying to look like a vintage studio picture, admitting ""I Am Not."""
1,BAD!,I am those kind of guy who like to read real life story of people and this is not it. I don't enjoy reading it. I read the first two chapters and I can't continue. the story line just seemed impossible for me.
1,No call back (beware),"I bought this board, (post to be new) recived the board gave it to the computer store to install into my system, (old board worked off and on) the store is telling me the board looks like it was used, or some one had tryed it, and the install book pages were looked at you can tell when you look and a new book if some one and looked and it, the pages have been folded open, thats what the computer store told me, there have build me many custom computers, there is not a dout in my mind the boad is bad and the person (guye) or what ever he is call, knew the board was junk, its been a week since I email him, this person is not very responible sell, and should be avoided."
2,wedding anniversary gift,"Tanzanit colour is a little bit paler than on the picture.Diamonds are shiny,looks good on a hand.Not for everyday wear.I am satisfied.Thank you"
1,The Old Which-a -roo!,"Be prepared for the old which-a-roo with this book. The author proclaims the book is about "" A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths"", but can't stop writing about himself. Coming from someone (me), who has an attention span long enough to read a postcard, I could not put down ""Shadow Divers"", having cut my teeth on New Jersey wreck diving a long time ago, although not to the extreme of deep wreck diving. It only seemed natural to follow it up and read ""The Last Dive"", which I have trouble keeping interested in when the author keeps writing mostly about himself. Anyway if you feel compeled to read this book, you should do yourself a favor and check it out from your local library, this way you can return it."
2,Wow!,"I purchased this because it was the least expensive and I just couldn't see spending $150 on a Green Machine (or thousands on new carpet...). I have a one year old and a nervous cat and my carpet is a mess. I read tons of reviews and saw people complaining about difficulty getting the tanks off. I had NO problems with this machine and just removed several stains from my light beige carpet including a coffee stain from a week ago, cat hairball stains and random food that my daughter flings around. This is a GREAT deal!"
1,ugh!,"This is pretty bad. Worst part is the lack of English subtitles for those German interviews. I was really looking forward to Klauss and Astrid, I don't speak German so, tough. Long sections of black on the screen, most likely just as filler. Don't bother, even if you are hard core."
2,On my keep forever list,I agree with everyone here.. I now look at my cats twinkling eyes & know they are sending me eyes kisses.. This is up there with my favorite dog book Timbuktu : A Novel (Paperback)-- a book from the dog's perspective
2,Great!,"Really, when it comes down to it - all Flash memory is the same, the only difference really is how it's stored/accessed. I've been using Compact Flash for quite sometime, nearly 4 years now - and have just recently moved over to the SD Card range because my new Pocket PC only takes this format.Anyway, I bought this card for the Pocket PC to store a bunch of MP3s/WMA files so that I could listen to music on my Pocket PC. The card is fast to write to (via USB it's still slow) and is extremely fast to read from - there is no skipping of the music and the quality is rather good.This card will work anywhere, I'm in Australia - and bought THIS EXACT card."
1,Waste of Bullock's talent and our time,Ignore the silly 5 star ratings some reviewers are giving here. This movie is a bomb. It wasn't funny or interesting. And why wasn't Ben Bratt from the first movie in this? A real snoozer!
2,Elegant and convenient,"A very nice and elegant ice-bucket, looks sturdy enough, right size to contain one bottle, and is reasonable priced. An ideal bargain. I highly recommend it."
2,Definitely worth reading.,"It took me a few books to get into Ms. Bland's style of writing but now her character, Marti McAlister, is one of my favorite detective stories. In this one Marti finds out more than she bargained for regarding the death of her husband. When she pulled the puzzle pieces together I was both happy for her and enraged about the findings all at the same time.Thanks Ms. Bland for writing a good detective novel with a main character that just happens to be black and female."
2,Blues Clues turned Rock,I listened to Steve's album through his webpage yesterday and I must say it was really good. There is no other way to put it so simply. It could be compared to early radiohead with a bit more synth sound behind it. Steve's voice is rather angelic and it flows magically over the anthems of guitars and piano. I recommend this album to anyone who likes good indie music!
2,NICE COLOR STONE,Nice pair of amethyst earrings for the price. Color and clarity of stones were very nice. The stones are a good size also.
1,screws dont tighten well.,"It gets 2 stars... The black powder coated finish is nice plus it does swivel as stated. Also like others have said, it wasn't level. In my case I was able to correct the leveling issue by just adjusting the screws on back of the tv.HOWEVER, as far as quality goes.. the screws dont tighten enough to prevent it from moving out of position. I'm using this on a boat and would of like to be able to adjust and lock the arm in a certain position but can't. Maybe I got a defective one? I will have to add some kind of strap so it doesn't slam back and forth over waves. The screws seem stripped and the arm is super fast (meaning it's really easy for it to swing back and forth with no resistant)."
2,Beautiful Holiday Music from Celine!,"Her voice + the music = an amazing, memorable holiday album for years to come."
2,No Place To Hide From This Great Book!,"What a fabulous debut by Madalyn Reese. The story of Emma and Anthony is full of action, suspense and a wonderful romance between two people who are destined to be together! Ms. Reese packs a wallop of twists and turns that kept this reader on the edge of her seat until the very end. Well done. What's next?"
1,Blew a fuse and stopped working immediately,"Maybe it's my car, not this thing, but I don't think it should have blown out the fuse on my Honda Element and stopped working within seconds of having only 2 items plugged into it. So not only did I have to send this thing back, but I also had to take my car in and get the fuse replaced. None of these things seem to work -- the first one I bought died in about 4-5 days. They are all cheap junk made in China. Why doesn't some manufacturer offer a competitive item that isn't junk? I've had a different brand of one of these in my 99 Camry for years and years with heavy use and never an issue. Now that I've gotten the fuse on the Element replaced, I have ordered a different brand and have crossed my fingers. Too bad -- this one had pretty good reviews."
1,Fourth time and it still doesn't work,"I am on my fourth (3rd directly from the factory) replacement.1st time - would not record or respond - bad DVD assembly2nd time - no sound via HDMI3rd time - HDMI worked for approx 3 hrs and then nothing4th time - back to RCA for another unit.So far, I haven't had one that worked and I have been trying to get a working unit for the last 6 months.Quality or engineering design is severly compromised with this piece of electronics.Local service vendor is GREAT, but so far, this whole experience is something all should avoid."
1,"hard, flavor losing cubes....","if you like to chew on gum that goes flat within minutes and transforms into a hard flavorless lump, then this gum is for you. It deserves no stars yet this wasn't an option."
2,"Frampton is Back, Buy it NOW!!!!!!!","This old 70's hero still rocks with the best of them. This is a very strong effort from this NOW overlooked legend. The opening track, ""Verge of a Thing"" with it's driving guitar and fast tempo proves that Frampton has not lost a ""thing"" over time, it is a quality rocker. This album also features many top notch ballads, ""Mia Rose, ""Love Stands Alone"", ""Not Forgotten"" and ""Above it All"". Also this album features one of the finest covers you will ever hear, ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" a tribute to the GREAT UNDER-RATED George Harrison, Peter does the Harrison composition so well it brings tears to the eyes. Harrison was a legend. Frampton is also a legend. This album is sure to be ""Not Forgotten"", Buy it ""NOW"" Frampton says it best, to quote track seven, ""I'm Back""."
2,Could not be happier!,Why pay double for a wall mount? Great value at a fantastic price! Will recommend this to all my friends & family.
1,Just awful,"My ten year old daughter thought this film was ""kind of stupid."" When I asked her what was wrong with it, she hesitated about 2 seconds and said ""It needed a plot."" If a normal ten year old can determine in 2 seconds what is wrong with this movie, why can't a studio with access to million dollar talent?This movie was particularly disappointing in comparison to the first film, which my daughter (and I) found fun and worth many reruns."
1,"Funny sometimes, but...","Yeah, sure, some of it makes for good satire, but let's face it. This comic book is just plain one-sided and angry and hardly has an ounce of redeeming value. This is all I got: Good African American equals Leftist African American. McGruder wanted us to think with boondocks, but all I got was anger coming from the pages... that's all. Sorry, but it's too narrow minded for my taste. And yes, he does owe Asians and Codi Rice an apology. There's a new website out there, check it out: members, dot, asianavenue, dot, com, forwardslash, BoycottMcgruder."
1,"SLOWEST shipping, NO communication, OK product.","Two weeks after purchase, no product or any email received even though Amazon said ship in 1-2 business day, and no reply to email query. Then I complained to Amazon and waited another week to get the product.The product is ok for use on body front where I can reach. Though most useful treatment should be on the back where I could not reach and the sucking device does not provide a soft tube to make it possible unless get help from second person.By the way, I tried to buy this product from same seller on Ebay and was over-bidded by some bidders, but then I was told they don't want to buy and I can buy it with the MAXIMUM price I set. It feels like manipulation. Either seller or Ebay was not reasonable."
1,Made for Hollywood,"Cheezy dialogue, obvious plot, predictible characters, gratuitous violence, completely out of touch with what goes on with the real special ops people, this has all the ingredients that appeal to those who rely on Hollywood for their ""literary"" venue. Yes, this is fiction, yes fiction is supposed to be entertaining. But what age group is the author trying to appeal to?"
2,Give Survivor PC a second chance!,"This game is a blast to play compared to Survivor: The Interactive Game (the first Survivor PC game.) You actually get to form alliances on this one and the challenges are a blast to play!!! You get to form your own dream tribe and watch it bloom -- or plummet!The bad point about this game is that only winners & jury members appear in the game. That's too bad, because I wanted to play or see characters such as Clarence or Rob, but since they didn't make the jury, they didn't make this game.And at the low price, it will definitely be worth your money to get this game based on the hit game show. Get it, you won't regret you did!!!"
1,AWESOME....then it will break.,"I really enjoyed this product... while it lasted. Sadly the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies. It lasted for 7 glorious egg mc muffin-like months THEN it just stopped working. The warranty had expired and I could no longer enjoy the egg goodness. I thought it was unusual and possibly a fluke but after some research I found out that this products failure is quite common. I contacted the company to no avail they did/would not reply. SO in conclusion, great idea, terrible implementation. Oh and USE NON-STICK SPRAY! The low price clearly does not allow for teflon."
2,The Perfect Holiday,"I was really excited to see this movie, not only because of the star power involved, but also because it is a Christmas movie. It's a ok movie."
1,It's All About David,"I was gripped by Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air and wanted another viewpoint on the 1996 tragedy. There is a bit in here about that but it is mostly All About David -- the autobiography of an intensely self-focused individual. When he meets his future wife, his thought is, ""this is the perfect partner for me"" -- and that, to me, says it all. It is also poorly edited. I do not recommend this book."
2,This Rocks!,"It's the ultimate Halloween film, I watch it every year. I totally recommend this for people who don't suck."
1,BAD BOOK,This is an awful book with terrible examples and poorly worded concepts. The homework has only a tenuous relationship to the text at best. Stay away from this book if at all possible.
1,Baaaaaaaaaah,"I did not like reading this book. First of all it's supposed to be about Emma, the book talks about war in Sudan and things that go waaaaay back like Gordon and anti-slavery, word to author: this isn't supposed to be a history book I'm assuming. I understand that ""Emma's War"" meant the war between Riek and Garang but it was supposed to be a biography of Emma, not of the history of Sudan or what some guy in the government had to say about this war. Second, she jumps back and forth from Emma to what's happening in Sudan to her own experiences, it's hard to understand when there are all these names that Emma is associated with, then add the people she met and people who are fighting in Sudan, those against it and you don't know who is who. Also I found that this booke xplained very little about the conflict in Sudan, I just got the gist of it that it's between north and south. That was it. I might as well mention this was required reading for school"
1,not an ella tribute cd,"this is a short cd of odetta in concert doing her usual set....if you have her earlier work,this is not needed. I expected a cd of new work related to ella ...it isn't. the concert just happened to take place near when ella died...hence the dedication. This is not a collection of songs made famous by ella and performed by odetta as I thought...very disappointed."
2,The complete masterpiece of Ernesto Sabato,"Here you'll find everything you want to find about Ernesto. A great part of his writings are here, so it's a good idea for all these people who want to read Ernesto and haven't any book yet"
1,Jolly Old Santa Claus,"I was elated when I found this book. I bought it for my children, but was VERY disappointed to see the both the text AND the pictures had been changed! How can they get by with saying they are ""featuring the finely crafted oil paintings by George Hinke along with the original prose story"", when both have been altered. I still have a copy of the original so I can compare. They also reduced the picture size and put in big fancy lettering. Who cares about the lettering... what made people fall in love with the book was the pictures!"
2,3 Great stories in one,I really liked this book. The stories of 3 daughters all different with a common tie. Normally I do not enjoy fantasy style stories but the Lady of the Lake was Awesome. Truly an edge of your seat could not put it down book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
2,Really good cabin filter,"What can I say about this product, well, it is a filter and it cleans air in your car."
2,Everyting it makes its self out to be,"Pro: Good display, video playback, custom wallpaper, EXCELLENT SOUND!, simple navigation, looks good, great battery life, and pretty much everything else advertised.Cons: I don't know how this compares to other players but it takes a sec to start, and I had to reset the OS by sticking a pin in that hole on the side once.But over all I am extremely happy with my purchase, a bargain if you ask me.Update (long term): I have an update on the cons.Cons:The buttons lost their clickyness (for lack of a better word) They still worked, but they no-longer have that tactile feedback.The screen went dead. I didn't drop it or anything it just died. Probably the risk of buying an oled display."
1,Not so good,"This movie was one of the most bizzare and unsettling movies I have seen recently expected. I was looking for a traditional scare and chop them up thang, and instead I got a more than unbelieveable story line mixed in with a paranormal ghost like unbelievable experience."
1,"Instead Of Creating New Stuff, The Artist Rips Off Prince","Buy the original album ""1999"" for some real funk. This annoying collection of remixes just proves that he does his best work ALONE. No boring rappers, no annoying back-up vocalists, no redone riffs on a classic song. The good news is Larry Graham's basslines kick ass and Rosario is a wonderful poet. The bad news is: 12 bucks for a bunch of remixes? Sheesh....if you're gonna charge us the price of a full album then MAKE a full album."
2,Belongs in every critical thinker's library,I disagree with the previous reviewer's comments that the book is largely of use to the legal professioin. I find the law case serves as a great backdrop to understanding science and judging scientific claims. Many great principles are explained in this book.
2,Very comfy and well made,I purchased these shoes for my Arthritis Aquatic class and am very happy with them. They are very comfortable and protect my feet from the rough surface of the pool bottom. Highly recommended!
2,Loads of fun,"I bought (4) cameras - one each for my niece & nephews for XMas. They've had a blast making videos & taking stills. The only drawbacks are that they burn through batteries quickly and picture darkness. (They require a lot of light for clear picts.) Overall, best presents I ever bought!!"
2,The Phantom Menace by Thomas Squara,"Star Wars Phantom Menace(1999).127mins Dir.George Lucas ,Starring Ewan Mcgregor, and Liam Neeson . Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader is discovered as a young child with an incredible spirit of a young Jedi Knight emerging.First knowledge of the Sith emerging in the face of Darth Maul. Humerous characters such as Ja Ja Binks ,are introduced to the series.Packed with adventure and action,with amazing computer visual effects. Thomas Squara."
2,AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE FROM START TO FINISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's true. It is the work of a genius. Fingaz is definately among the all-time untouchables. This is a phenomenal cd, beats, rappin, and all. Fingaz' work is definitely at the top. He has established himself as his own unique self with great confidence. I don't think Fingaz needs help from anybody but the guests on his album are fanstastic as well. There is not one weak song on this cd. I can easily listen to it from start to finish, and still want more. Fingaz' cd is not only killer beats and incomparable rappin but it has depth, breadth, and quality messages. Fingaz really makes you think. He hits you in the head as well as the heart. Now that is the work of a genius. His cd is not just words and music, it is life. TO FINGAZ AND HIS CREW, THANK-YOU FOR AN UNSURPASSING WORK OF ART AND CREATIVITY! It is beautiful! And thank-you especially for a clean version.-------An advocate for clean/edited hip-hop."
2,Great for Baseball Fans of All Ages!,"Decide who your favorite teams are, what they're worth, and set up your Monopoly game! We had a NASCAR version of this game, but within a year or two, the drivers' names were outdated and my kids didn't want to play it anymore.With this game, you can change the board face AND the deed cards to reflect the ever-changing world of sports!"
1,Smurfed,"Trying to cover the encroaching gray as many people do, I was referred to Clairol's Loving Care by my cosmetologist. The color went on well and lasted for the time period expected. Unfortunately however, it gave me purple highlights, especially out in the sunlight, that had my wife and kids calling me Papa Smurf! A detailed letter to Clairol went unanswered. I guess they don't want to hear about failures; just successes. Anyway, I'm now looking for an alternative product, but haven't found it yet. Beware of this stuff....you might just get Smurfed!!!!!!"
2,Powerful Hub & Well Worth the Price,"I have gone through numerous hubs that were underpowered and failed when I hooked up too many devices - even if not all the ports were used. Having a hub fail, especially in the middle of a project, can be a nightmare. I searched the internet for something with extra ports and a strong power supply. I tried this Belkin Hub because it met those criteria, plus I have been happy with other Belkin products I own. I am truly impressed with this hub. It not only can handle my devices, but I have 3 of them daisy chained together connected to my Mac, and haven't had a single problem yet. I can't tell you how many hubs have failed on me over the years, but these Belkin Hubs have been cabled together and running my whole office worth of drives now for 2 years without a single hitch. I have now purchased the same hubs for both of my home computers and their extra drives. I am SOLD. I highly recommend this hub, especially if you have found other hubs underpowered."
2,Review for Resume Guidebook purchase,The book arrived in the condition described in a reasonable amount of time. Good purchasing experience.
1,Not really for non-baseball lovers,"I read reviews that claimed this story was great for those who are not baseball fans. I wish I could agree. I'm not particularly a baseball fan, but wanted to know what all the hype about this book (and movie) was all about. I liked the first few chapters, but then very quickly got bogged down in unfamiliar references and statistics. I hate to not finish a book, and I tried for days to get through to the end, though it started to seem very repetitive mid-way through and my eyes began to gloss over the pages without enthusiasm. Ultimately, I gave up a few chapters short of the end. Just not enough here to keep my interest. I think I'll just watch the movie to find out the end."
1,Inaccurate,I bought this thermometer and found it to be completely inaccurate. Meat was always hideously overcooked. It showed water boiling at 70C which is 30C too low. I would not recommend this product.
1,No new tale to tell,"Probably the worst romance novel I've ever read. Could have used a little more ""frenetic humor"" and not so much of the ""stark sadness"" anyhow. And the hero doesn't even get laid!"
2,"Hummingbird Magic, by Alicia Brauns","My family and I recently viewed this delightful and utterly charming visual gem. All of us and our friends, the young as well as the not so young, enjoyed it immensely and could not help but insatiably watching it again and again with increasing enthusiasm. Each viewing made us discover additional qualities. It takes much love for nature, much talent, patience, perseverance and commitment to produce a DVD of such genuine richness in contents and incontestable educational value, pictorially expressed with admirable sobriety . Our compliments to the author who brings a breath of fresh ear and love for the animal word into our homes. We will be looking forward to, and looking out for future works from this obviously talented filmmaker.Arnold H. Einhorn MD, F.A.A.P.Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics,"
2,Rowenta DX8900 Prof Iron No Auto Shut Off,Crazy for Quilts: A Celebration of the Quilter's Art (Town Square Giftbook Series)Art Quilts: A Celebration: 400 Stunning Contemporary DesignsMasters: Art Quilts: Major Works by Leading Artists (The Masters)I was disappointed at first and I am still adjusting to this iron. I love the non auto shut off - been waiting a long time for a major company to come out with this feature. The water container is huge and fabulous. You MUST follow the directions precisely to have the iron work correctly. It steams beautifully but you must be careful of sticky stuff on the sole plate so keep the cleaner they recommend on hand and a cloth to wipe the sole plate clean now and again. I'd probably give it a 5 if it weren't for this problem.
2,Diamond in the rough!!,Badlands was a great band which I believe came along at the wrong time. If they would have gotten together a few years earlier in the peak of the metal revolution they would have been a legendary band. I love Ray Gillen!! Tremendous singer paired up with Jake E. Lee sound like a harder edged Led Zeppelin!!
2,"Time tested, rugged, reliable pump","Been using this exact one for twenty years. This, my third, is only a back up. Would still be on the first if I had done some simple upkeep during the dry season. When it's called upon this machine just goes and goes, sometimes for days on end, emptying our basement sump."
1,"Not terrible, but not great","Most of the time, even in relatively strong wind, this kite has a difficult time staying in the air. It'll fly for a while, but the balance is relatively poor, so it likes to take fast trips straight to the ground with little or no notice. :\ Oh well. It's pretty. Just not the best kite."
1,infinite negative stars - worst I've seen in a long time,Question: why did a talented distingushed actress like Holly Hunter get involved in this idiotic film? Everything is bad about Little Black Book. I rented it at Blockbuster for my teenage daughter and even she hated it. I must admit that I did not/could not watch all of it but I did catch the incredibly heavy-handed finale.The script is beyond terrible: one painful cliche after another and Brittany Murphy is simply a no-talent. To avoid at all costs. The worst movie I have seen in a very long time.
2,Very real and close to the heart,"I love Nicholas Sparks and he definitely did a wonderful job when writing this story. There were so many times that I thought ""wow, thats exactly how i felt when my husband was still in the army""...I recommend this to any young women with husbands in the army or anyone who enjoys a good romance novel."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR A LITTLE FAN,"Having read every Bentley Little book, including Death Instinct, I can honestly and regretfully say that this is his worst book. After the first hundred or so pages, I could tell that Bentley had lost his inspiration .... Ridiculous scenes involving dancing pottery killed any horror or suspense that could have built from this complete mess of a story that dragged on and on. I love this author, don't get me wrong, but this is one to skip. I recommend The Ignored, The Mailman, and The Association."
2,The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,This was a great book! Great for a little comic relief sometimes.
2,Inspiration on each page,"If you're looking for a how-to manual,keep looking. But if you're looking for a book with beautiful photographs of glass beads, you're in the right place. Each page contains photographs of beads by talented glass artisans. What's especially nice about this book is that there are artists represented from many different skill levels. For an intermediate glass artist like me, it's good to see that I've come a long way, but there is still so much territory to explore. The photographs in this book catalog this evolution exquisitely.It's inspirational and almost overwhelming to see so many gorgeous beads together. It will provide me with inspiration for a long time.I would recommend this book for artists and collectors alike."
2,Excellent CD for learning Hawai'ian,"I use this in the car. I loop through a track until I get it. The online material (they give the URL on the box) was really helpful.I skipped the beginning story because it was way beyond my ability. After finishing all the lessons, then go back and try to understand the story...but get the online written version to follow along with.Upside: Excellent accent. Lots of material.Small downsides: sometimes too long or too short of a time to repeat. Have to skip the first 3 tracks until you have learned all the material.All in all this is the absolute best of all the tapes and books I've used. I really, really recommend it."
2,Great story,"Actually I haven't finished the book yet coz it is so good that I think I need to share with other people first. The story includes all of my fantasy Romantic sex, Rough sex, Rape and everything and it makes my heart beat a thousand miles per hour while reading this. Gordon uses words to describe evrything so perfect. Sometimes the story gets so tensed that I have to put it down and take a rest. Anyway I think u all will love it. I know it published ages ago but who cares as long as it makes u feel so hot reading it."
1,It's OK,Works well with my boom box (use it while I work outside). That's because it can be placed close to the antenna. Not very effective in the car where the antenna is outside the car.
1,What a waste of money,"When I first new that Gamecube was coming out, I imagined it would be great. I bought it with Luigis Mansion. THE GAME WAS...So then I purchased other games, that were same stupid thing (except for Rogue Squadron and Smash Bros.)Then I started to get information about PS2.So I purchased PS2 and bought Metal Gear Solid 2, AND IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER!! I sold the Gamecube and the games and started trying the PS2 games and almost every game I played was excellent!!. Also, Playstation has 4 new games at the speed tha the gamecube has 1!!.The only good thing Nintendo is doing laslty is the Game Boy Advance.BUY PS2!!"
2,I think everyone should stand with Ms. Sabol against aol.,"I regret that I have not yet read the book. I have requested it for Christmas from my US family. I was shocked to hear about aol and their legal nonsense trying to stop Ms. Sabol using this title. Everyone who believes in not letting the big corporations bully the ""little"" people should stand beside Ms. Sabol. I look forward to receiving the book and I know that I will enjoy it. Good Luck."
2,small but healthy!,"i came home from europe on a mission to find a small indoor olive tree. almost all i found online were really expensive- hated to spend so much when i wasn't even sure i could get it to survive... this one was the right price! it is small- it was not as full as the one in the picture. i re-potted it right away, and although i have only had it about a month, i can tell it has grown and looks great. given that this was at least 1/4 of the price of others i found, it is a winner."
2,MAGNIFICENT ALBUM!!!!,"This is truly magnificent!!!, once again Mike Mainieri brings up a recording that reaches all of your senses; The album evolves beautifully from beginning to end, with very high peaks on ""I've Seen it all"" and ""Flamenco Sketches"", teamed up with Norwegian sax player Bendik Hofseth(he appears on Steps Ahead-NYC)and a group of other wonderful Norwegian players, Northern Lights is simply one of the best jazz offerings of this year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,A real treasure!,This is a great movie! Ignacio Lopez Tarso perfoms tremendously! I highly recomend it.
2,An easy to follow guide but very POWERFUL,This book will help to learn to instill in students the art of appreciating reading and enhance their writing skillls.
1,Bad idea,My daughter loves having these in the tub. BUT the only thing she does with them is try to drink out of them. The water also rarely turns the wheel unless poured directly on it. If you don't mind your kids drinking the bath water they will love these. If you do I suggest finding something else.
2,holman commentaries,They are beyond the help I need but when I get the entire set my grandson will be able to research any of the bible he wishes. It is a timeless series and will benefit my family for years to come.
1,Dullsville.,"Another spurious ""country"" artist. This guy is John Waite in a cowboy hat. These kind of guys don't even stop to think about what they're singing about. It's a sad state of affairs when guys like this sell more albuns than Robbie Fulks!"
1,I wouldn't use outdoors,"Maybe this lock would be OK inside, but outdoors it rusts quickly and freezes easily. I had to replace it in less than a month."
1,Not up to his standards,I have read and enjoyed most of Baldacci's books. This one was so contrived that the ending was a little tough to get to. So many twists and turns that I think even he got lost.
2,Works well,I installed this in an auxilliary diesel fuel tank on my truck. It was easy to adjust to the specific tank size & gives accurate fuel level signals on a Sunpro gauge that I purchsed at the same time. The only negative is a lack of signal damping resulting in the gauge needle swinging about when driving on rough roads.
2,Best rendition of Victimae Paschali Laudes there is,"I have a collection of around 25 chant cds and this is by far my favorite of all - the rendition of ""Victimae Paschali Laudes"" is so natural and this version of ""Salve Regina"" is the one I always play before retiring at the end of the day - remembering how, in the SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN, Thomas Merton described the monks a Gethsemani Abbey doing the same thing each evening... This is also the only cd I bought separate copies of for home, the car and work. Great for reading and meditation as well."
2,A woman's perspective,"Judith Sherman's Say the Name is a survivor's account of a teenage girl's struggle with God and humanity in Ravensbruck concentration camp during the Holocaust. Sherman, now a wife, mother and grandmother living in the United States, writes her memoir some 50 to 60 years after the Nazi's carried out their ""Final Solution.""Sherman's poetry and prose in this book reflect a loss of people, places and things that make up the fabric of a person's life, culture and beliefs. She is, at turns, angry and bewildered. She demands an accounting for these atrocities. But ultimately Sherman's quest for survival and her insistence on remembering the names of women who were killed conveys a sense of humanity and even of hope. This is Sherman's first book, and she is not a polished writer. She writes in fragments and one has the sense of poetry scribbled on napkins over the years and then included in the memoir. Her book is all the stronger for this."
2,Knuckleheadz!!!,"This album is rawer than raw, it even outdid 36 Chambers. RZA's production on this album is his finest yet. The album isn't like 36 Chambers. It is more surrealistic, more sadistic, and more edgy. Raekwon tells his gritty point of view of every persons rise and downfalls. Raekwon's first and only album really makes it's influence in New York Gangsta Rap, and it is considered as a landmark in hip-hop."
1,Don't buy this unit.,"Had this unit for a year. At the end of a year, the rain gauge had cracked and the thermometer tube had come loose and fallen. As a result, it could neither provide rain amount or temperature. What more could you want?"
2,Styling and clean sound at a low price,This is a perfect unit for a small room. Don't expect too much out of it.
1,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE AND ITS THE END OF JANUARY,"I have yet to receive any issue or information on this magazine, will soon be contacting them directly, i think i have gave them enough leeway."
2,"""Tiger, tiger, burning bright...""","...Begins one of my many favorites introduced to me by this book. My mother (a librarian) first read poems such as ""Wynken, Blynken, and Nod"" to me from this book, and I continued to read them until a hiatus where a young man disdains poetry as not being macho. I rediscovered many an old friend when I started reading these poems to my own children. Now the book is in tatters (glueback bindings do not stand the test of time, especially not in dry Colorado), and I search for a replacement. If the reissue has indeed been 'sanitized' in the name of political correctness, then I fear much will have been lost, and I will be reduced to trying to rebind my tatters."
1,Don`t buy,"this book have not very much pictures and isn`t very informative, apart of that it was very bad scratched, and I can`t tell if was in the shipping or from the buyer"
1,Warm Stripes,"I had high hopes for this item, but it fell far short of my expectations. Instead of the entire towel getting warm, as I had hoped, only the sections that came in direct contact with the warming bars became warm. Essentially, all you get is small stripes of warmth."
1,I'm left feeling sour...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
2,Pretty Good for LinAl,"The true test of a math book is whether or not you keep it around for future reference, and this has been on my bookshelf for the last two years.Unlike some other math books (and, heaven forbid, higher level physics books) that I have had the dubious pleasure of slogging through during my time at a math and science college, you actually know where the problems are coming from in this LinAl book. They provide copious examples, examples upon examples, and the problems in each chapter are drawn from them, mostly verbatim, with a few numbers changed. A few might find this tedious, but I was so goddam happy to finally know where to find the information that would help me learn the material and finish my homework that I didn't care.Pros: Lots of examples, LinAl is taught competently, if not excitingly.Cons: Price. This book was assigned the year it was published, so no used copies existed. I think the college system and the book publishing industry are in cahoots."
2,Don't even compare them to Backstreet Boys!,"I just think that people should give Nsync the credit they deserve. They are a million times better than the Backstreet Boys (whose songs DO all sound the same) and they can sing...I mean really sing, which is far more than I can say for most of the boy bands out there. Their dance moves are incredible and, like someone mentioned in another review, they sing live at all their concerts, simultaneous with their dancing, which is no easy task, let me tell you...and none of that wack lip-syncing or cracking voices that goes on at Backstreet Boys concerts (Nick has been going through puberty for a while now!). They put on a real show. So, as far as buying this CD goes, just give them a chance and you'll see that they're really great."
2,If it like the cassette,WOW!!!! IF YOU LIKE SONORA DINAMITA THEN THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!!! IF IT IS THE CASSETTE THAT I HAVE NOW THEN I NEED IT IN CD...IT IS WORTH THE BUY...YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!! PROMISE!!!
1,"""I Spy"" in Name Only","Once again, a classic TV series receives shoddy Hollywood treatment. ""I Spy"" (2002) takes the show's name and trashes everything that made it memorable. Failing to click as a team, Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson never display the smooth rapport associated with Bill Cosby and Robert Culp. Meanwhile, director Betty Thomas struggles through depressingly routine material. Avoid this fiasco and track down the 1965-68 episodes (which the screenwriters never bothered to see)."
1,worthless....,This is without a doubt the worst reference on typography that I have ever read. It is filled with useless metaphors and examples. I really expected more from the Adobe Press.
1,This is retarded,"Why in the heck, would they try to get ppl to buy a c-d with 3 songs on it. let alone, you only need to get hybrid theory and meteora for the total amount of songs they have done! why waste the money???"
1,dell frickin sucks!!!!!!!!!!,do not waste ur money on sucky dells like this. go to ibuypower.com and they have better computers for less money. like right now i am using an ibuypower computer and its so cool and so powerful. if ur goin to buy a computer go to ibuypower!!! dont waste ur frickin money on this terrible dell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Could be better!,I wasnt real impressed with the taste of this mix in. It starts out fizzy but that goes away pretty fast. It starts to taste like vitamins more and more. I dont really feel any more energy either. I really dont think it does all it says it does for you. Most likely wont buy again.
2,The Cosby Show-2nd season,"The second season of the Cosby Show has some of the funniest episodes and some of the most poignant ones. I have been a fan since day 1 in Sept of 1984. I would recommend this dvd to everybody, because its all about family."
2,A Masterpiece!!!,Combine the genius of the late Stanley Kubrick (probably the best director of all time) and Steven Spielberg and you get the must moving piece of story telling ever. This movie will outlast all the dumb criticism thrown against it. Truly a masterpiece.
2,Fantastic.....If Only,"Criterion has done a beautiful job with this classic. Flawless in every respect. Great supplements. My only complaint, and maybe he was unavailable, is why Billy Chapin, the star of the film is not included in the commentary? What memories and insight he would have into the making of this film. Other than that, Criterion has outdone itself!!"
2,groove indeed...,"first, you have to be ok with the fact that these guys are all over the place. if you have any subgenre obsessions or hangups, don't bother with groove armada. but if you like a little funk, a fair amount of house, and a whole hella-va-lotta air-esque atmospheric groove, then these are your guys. as long as it's this well done, they can mix in whatever they like. definitely one of the best things in this style since moon safari (which will, of course, probably never be beat), but distinctively more british. if you're trying to decide whether or not to buy this one, don't try to scan through the first minute of each track. that would be a terrible gauge of the cd...it demands a little more, but it gets so good and it's oh so worth it."
1,No interest,My dog doesn't use them and has no interest. She's a 3 month old boxer teething and prefer's chewing on the plastic handle of the cat's brush.
2,Quick to the meat and potatoes but well explained,"This was my first introduction to Python with little programming experience in general. The author does a great job of ramping into examples containing 'real world' relevant code. This book is a refreshing change from the apparent trend of 'the more pages, the better' Material is condensed into small bite-sized chunks of 5-6 pages."
2,works well,"works like a charm in my murano with a bose sound system. there was a hint of white noise in there when I had the iPhone volume really low and had to boost the signal at the dashboard, but that was easily rectified by putting the iPhone's volume to about half. yay old school tape decks!"
2,Serenely beautiful. Music to meditate by.,"Less expansive and involving than Kater's ""Migration"" (with Carlos Nakai), but this is some of the most serenely contemplative music I have heard. Perfect to play in a darkened room at the end of a numbing day. Seventy-five unbroken minutes of uncomplicated soul-massaging harmony. The blending of real voice, flute, violin, and cello infuse Kater's synthesized sounds with the realm of the natural."
2,Excellent Case,"Great material, and I trust this case to hold my precious laptop. The two pouches has room to hold my 14.5 laptop with my wireless mouse, the charger, and my removable media (Flashdrive, CDs, and flash cards) safely and securely."
2,fade unevenly,"These shirts fade very unevenly, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the quality and comfort."
2,Excellant first novel by a teenage girl.,"This book would be excellant even if the author hadn't written it when she was just thirteen. Risika/Rachel was a great character; forced to make agonizing moral choices as a 300-year-old vampire while at the same time hunting the vampire she believes killed her brother in the late 1600s. She must face who she is and the fact she is partly responsible, and learn the truth about revenge and what really happened 300 years ago when she was turned. A wonderful first effort; I can't wait for Ms. Atwater-Rhodes's second novel."
2,It's as good as I expected.,"It's a PITA to assemble, as the instructions are quite vague. Once it's up tho, it's the best chin up/pull up setup I've owned, It's better than the perfect pullup bar as well. It's equal to the door gym tho, as that doubles as a push up setup as well.Still, look workouts for it on the net, and enjoy. It's money well spent, and the price was a bargain."
2,A just comeuppance,"My late mother, who was affectionately called ""Mary Dear"" by my father, would have enjoyed this short, but engrossing look at marital life. Who wears the pants in this family? Well, you might (or might not) be surprised. The illustrations are delightful and the story ends up just where it should!"
2,Great Series,Loved this show. I wish it had never ended. One of the best collection I've seen in a long time
1,Algaecide?! Algae food!,"I have a small pond, about 200 gallons. The pond has a filter-fountain systems that is active about 12 hours a day. In the summer, I have an algae problem. I have used this product as instructed for several weeks. It has not seemed to impact on the algae in any way. Indeed, the problem has gotten worse - the algae love this stuff! To be honest, it may have gotten worse because of increased sunlight hitting the pond - but the fact remains that the pond continues to have a severe algae problem despite the use of this product."
2,Great Value!,"I've had this gizmo for several months. It is very easy to setup and just as easy to operate. There's a tiny remote control. But, I never use it - just too small. I just manually push the buttons on the front for ON/OFF & Channel 1, 2, 3 selection. It is a great bargain at about $40 for a TOSLINK switch."
2,Stroke of midnight,great story. The auhur is an excellent story teller. She forgets nothing. Everyone has their own personality. You cannot put down this book.
1,Don't buy it,"Well, i never write reviews but don't buy this thing. i had a norelco but i broke it. i bought this as a replacement and the battery life is HORRIBLE. fully charged, it didnt even last through one trimming session. by the way, u cant use the cord as a power source. all it does is charge the battery so when its dead u have to wait until it charges some to finish shaving. if i can save a few people from buying it this review was worth writhing. buy a norelco"
2,Nice toothpick holder,"It's three and one quarter inches long, three eighths in diameter not counting the pocket clip, and will hold 7 or 8 round toothpicks without being too tight to get stuck.Since I am used to carrying other things in my pants pockets, this toothpick holder is not a problem for me. It can be clipped on a shirt pocket as well."
2,Great CD,"I love German Christmas songs! This is a great purchase, with almost all songs I like. Miss Leise Rieselt der Schnee"
1,"Black Vikings, what a joke!!!","Black Vikings, yeah right why do hollywood morons always make European heritage a grey mono-culture and distort history (reality) to be over the top PC and infest multi-culture into everything. I had to give one star to post my reply."
1,Music Overpowers,"Regardless of the fact that I love Jessica Simpson, this CD doesn't live up to the others, namely Sweet Kisses and In This Skin. The music really overpowers her voice, particularly in Spin Me 'Round (Like a Record). You Belong to Me is possibly the best song on the album. A Public Affair is a good summery song, like if you're in the car with your girlfriends on a road trip, but beyond that, it's not so catchy. If you're not a dedicated JS fan, skip on this one."
1,good for a few years,"we got these a few years back, and i loved the way it looked. however, after a year or two, they started breaking. if you used your fork to cut into somthing, the round meTal part that holds the fork/spoon/knife head, cracked and one by one all our forks broke. we have had it for 4 years and all our forks are broken, the round metal cap at the bottom of the handles have come off, and the round metal part that holds the utensil heads have all rusted and turned brownits good for a short while, but not for daily use. i regret buying these and will now only buy all metal utensils that can't break"
2,A book for everyone!,"A wonderful and extensive collection, on a wealth of topics relating to personal nutrition, and fitness. What I liked most about this book, is the wonderful layout, it has diagrams, pictures, boarders, and so much more! Dr. Baugh has obviously done extensive research into sports nutrition, and this is a book EVERYONE should have. There is nothing being sold, no off the wall ideas, Its just a book of information that can help even the most seasoned body builder.A Wonderful book, superbly written, and easy to understand."
1,Brutal,"I agree with the first reviewer. This book is poorly put together. Some of the photo's look as if they were copied directly from an old grainy video. The questions asked during the cast interviews were a bit dumb, too. I bought this book new at the time it was released and ran across it while clearing out a spare room. I can't believe I kept it! I gave it two stars out of respect for the original cast (everyone before and including that wierdo George Lindsay) One more thing - the show became a drag after a few years because Andy was always pee'd off and agitated all the time."
1,a book obsessed with technologies,"The very idea that all the technologies serve the purpose of businesses gets lost here in this book.If one wants to look for help for their work, look somewhere else.If one wants to learn some jargons to impress his/her date, this one is the ideal one."
2,Buy This Disk,"I love this group so much, that I've bought several copies of their disk to give to friends. It seems that every time I've seen them, it's yet another incredible, magical experience. I can't wait till the next disk is released!"
1,dont buy,"do not buy this float they will break after a few weeks. made very cheap, you can also purchase similar floar in local stores"
2,A Pandoras Box of Ideas,Very simply put I categorically cansay that when I opened this book itwas like entering an enlightened world.Joseph Campbell's intellect spoke lucidly andBill Moyer's insightful questions made thisbook a journey worth taking.
2,Hard to find wiper arms.,I bought these wiper arms and wiper blades for my son's old Mustang II hoping that they would fit. No Problem! It took about 15-20 minuter to install and put on the blades!
1,It's too slow to cook!,"I bought this one one month ago, because I moved to another place, I just use it three times , but it's too slow to cook rice, it will take one hour, my old one just took less than 30minutes."
2,An Excellent Reagan Primer,"As the pundits and revisionists attempt to rewrite the history of his presidency, those who know Reagan continue to demontstrate the effect this great man had on them and history. This book is an excellent introduction into how Reagan the Man affected Reagan the President. Through examples of how Reagan handled his life, his staff and his faith, Mr. Robinson gives us insight into the inner world of Ronald Reagan. His rock solid faith and conviction flowed through events both personal and public, and changed the very course of history. I will most certainly be buying Reagan's memoir to get more perspective on a man who is without a doubt one of the great presidents of our time."
2,'Allo ' Allo Series one and two,"I'm always on edge when I order a new series but this turned out to be a winner and I can hardly wait to order the rest in the series. My husband and I are both avid fans of British work, especially British humor. This silly series captivated both of us. Hilarious in the least."
1,worst cd..best song,"this is the worst bad religion cd aside from new america.....although 'sowing the seeds of utopia' is one of there best songs...worth checking out for that song alone, but the rest of the cd is crap"
2,Excellent printer for the money!,"I had the use of this model Brother laser printer as editor of my club newsletter. When I gave up the job the printer, which was owned by the club, went to the new editor. I liked this machine so much and missed it so much that I ordered one for myself. It is fast and efficient at printing double sided and collated pages."
2,Here Comes The Past Again,"Wow. That's all I can say. This book has instantly become one of my top picks. The opening lines of the first chapter read like a novel. Jeffers does an amazing job of taking you back to that world and filling in some of the blanks. Though I am still absorbing much of the book, and have been using it in M.Div papers and teaching scripts, I think the best section in the whole deal is on Greco-Roman education and the existence of house associations, burial, business and other associations, which were avenues for the church to legal ""be"" Christians without necessarily proclaiming their new religion. What a page turner!"
2,Open Your Brazilian Eyes!,"Tania Maria succeeds on what could possibly be her masterpiece recording. ""Forbidden Colors"" finds her in an ironic rainbow of musical genres converging. From her reggae-ish ""O Bon E"" to her bossa-nova on ""Brazilian Eyes"", she shines brilliantly. ""Please Don't Stay"" makes you want to not only stay, but play it again...and again! And with Ms. Maria, remember this...""It's Only Love"". Enjoy! Dr. Paul A. Racioppi, Jr., Brooklyn, New York, Sunday, October 7, 2012."
1,Save Your Money,"I played it one time and threw it away. This is not traditional ""honky tonk"" as most of us understand it. The style is a kind of ""herky-jerky"", improv version of all of the old songs.---not the way they were written. It's not the Johnney Maddox that I was familiar with."
1,Ants keep coming back!!,"The ants are very attracted to the goo, and they do go away for maybe a day. However, they keep coming back and they come back with more numbers!! The ants eat this stuff very quickly and I did reapply the goo after they seemed to have eaten most of it, but no bottom line is that this product did not do its job getting rid of the ants. They just kept coming back."
2,Kids love it,"My kids love to watch this DVD. It is a treat for them, and it is entertaining to watch."
1,Warning,This product works in with Windows XP ONLY! Do not buy if you have Windows Vista or Window 7!!!!!!! The setup for Windows XP is very particular to SP2. I updated my Windows XP SP2 to SP 3 and the junk software that comes with this thing quit working!! Don't but this thing!!!!!
2,Hard to put down,The story has the reader hooked from the first chapter to the last. The reader becomes emotionally connected to Beth and understands the choices she has made.
1,"Interesting subject, awful writing","Not even a subject as interesting and controversial as GG Allin could make the effort of reading this worthwhile. The writing is limp, scattered and self-serving. The author spends more time describing the symptoms of the cold he caught while on tour with the Murder Junkies than he does describing their adventures or giving us insight into the personalities of the relevant characters. Reading this is a...waste of time. Buy the book, but just look at the pictures. They'll tell you as much as the author did, and you'll save yourself two hours."
1,What was/is she thinking or is she?,Her antics lately have ruined her music for me. I can't even listen to this album because I don't like the two songs that have been released on the radio. They sound like Minnesota music from the 80's. What was/is she thinking or is she?I received this CD as a Christmas gift but will be returning it unopened because she has just gone too far lately. Is this a good role model for our young girls? Haven't they got enough to deal with in every day life without having someone who is out of touch with reality being displayed as a role model? She's trying to be Madonna and certainly cannot fill those shoes because they haven't been vacated yet.
2,Standard FJ226,"I put this in my 95 GMC Jimmy on 12/26/2011 . This was a completely brand new unit , unlike most other brands . This corrected a common problem caused by having a faulty fuel pressure regulator . So far after 2 months , I'm very happy with it . My Jimmy has never ran so well during the previous 2 years I've owned it and I have no more sulfur smell coming from the tailpipe .Thanks to Amazon , I received the very best price and FREE shipping ."
1,Blah.,"Just one word. Blah. It's hard to understand, creepy, and disgusting. If you're like me, just tring this book to make yourself feel brave, forget it. I recommend The Name Of This Book Is Secret, or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(Remember to not get the original book) In the long and short, this book is @&?#%$!"
1,my review,I assumed this would be a pair but was a single item. After I received this item I was able to find a pair at a local retailer for the same price of this single item. Did not return it as the shipping and restocking fee makes it to costly.
1,"Meh, at best!","Just read everyone elses reviews! That sums everything up. I bought this combo set to replace my MX5000 mouse that died (due to heavy use) and to finally try a cordless keyboard.Well, Logitechs BIGGEST mistake was discontinuing the MX5000 mouse. I had mine for almost 5 years, and I spend a lot of time playing WoW.The combo isn't overly bad, but it's not up to Logitech par. At one point, Logitechs bluetooth dongle created problems with itself. Meaning, the installed driver for the Keyboard/mouse combo had a problem with Logitechs drivers for bluetooth headsets. I don't have a bluetooth headset, but I did have a Keyboard / mouse that no longer worked.To sum everything up:""Buyer beware."" on this combo!"
1,Disappointed,"If the song ""Disappointed"" by Electronic had been included on this disc, then I might not have been so...disappointed. Like some of the other reviewers, I was expecting a full-length version of the Queer Eye theme song. Instead there's a mixed version that isn't very good in my opinion. I feel like I've been duped by the record company. The rest of the songs on the CD aren't bad. The Duran Duran song is pretty good. But my expectations focused on the Queer Eye theme song, which has left my disappointed."
2,Great switch,This is an excellent product that you don't have to worry about it. I installed one of these about more than a year ago and is working 24/7 without any failure or complaint
1,Poor editing,"Positives,I like the layout and feel of the book. The condensed format is really good. Good to get practice and working quickly in a subject that usually peresented in an overcomplex fashion.Negatives:I have no idea how this book passed any QA. I have found many errors in the equations and in the examples. A simple example of this is page 25 figure 2.7 the lines on the graph are mis labelled they need to be swapped.The line for the top of the constraint is labelled 20x + 8y >= 680 and should be labelled x + 2/5y <= 40The line of the bottom of the contraint is labelles x + 2/5 <= 40 and should be labelled 20x + 8y >= 680If your math is weak or you have limited confidence to challenge the author you will have difficulty in understanding how the examples work.Shame.... Luckly I bought the book second hand. It certainly is not worth the full retail price..."
1,Don't buy this one!,"Contained a brief entry on modernism, but not a word about postmodernism. Let alone postcolonialism...A dictionary is no good if it doesn't have the words you want to look up!"
2,Glittery Goodness,"Just listen to Glitter On a couple times. It's one of those melodies that doesn't sound so much invented as discovered, like a diamond underground, waiting to be unearthed. The rest of the album is nearly that good, even when the song lasts for like nine billion minutes (I Should Be That Guy). And Lincoln Town Car features this astonishing bit of lyric poetry, which manages to be vague, explicit, lurid, and almost innocent, all at the same time: ""Your tongue was sweet / You legs were strong / I'm wasted out my head."" This is music for people who like songs, singing, guitars, and drums."
2,Broccoli Power - ENERGIZE!,"A blistering indictment of all that is evil, phoney, and cruel in the world. But just because this comic's heart is in the right place and it's targets are well-chosen doesn't mean it's any good.I could go on and on about the plot's coherence, the high-quality artwork, and Mickey's moral complexity; but what really makes this comic good are the little touches. Here are a few of my favorites:1. Hali Bossi's Turkish ""pants of many patterns"",2. The exterminator's tiny wiener,3. ""I am purified! Now I am ready to kill! Kill! Kill in Jesus name!""4. A Central American palindrome5. Fatima (that chick is hot!)6. The coolest cereal box cover ever!7. Zombie rehabilitation8. The proud look on the duck's face after he bites the rabbit's ass9. The Hateful Bread10. Winger, Asia, Poison!This comic is superb."
1,I didn`t receive my item,"I HAVE ORDERED A THE BOOK COMPUTER BASED TOEFEL ESSAY, BUT I DIDN`T RECEIVE IT BECAUSE THEY PRETEND THAT THEY DIDN'T FIND THE ADRESS.ALSO, I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE REFUND."
2,one of their newer efforts,Consistently excellent. Tracks included are:1) May the Glory of the Lord2) Gloria3) Awesome God4) Before the Throne of God Above5) Shout to the Lord6) He is Exalted7) The Highest Glory8) Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed9) He Loves to Hear Our Praise10) I Come By the Blood11) More of You
2,Zelda takes an encore,"Zelda is back, and it's hard to believe that something this good could fit on the GameBoy Color!! With new weapons like the Seed Satchel, Switchhook, and a now upgraded Roc's Feather which lets you jump over 3 holes if you play it right, this game has won my heart and is a definite buy for any Zelda fan. Iv'e played the first dungeon before, and already I was astounded at the great graphics, coll bad-guys, and the sweet boss. If you like Mega Man and Zelda, hang on, because Capcom AND Nintendo both made this masterpiece!!"
2,Comfortable and great support for the price,"The sportaid, hernia truss double I found to be comfortable. It's easy to adjust since it has felcro to adjust around the waist. Make sure you order your waist size and not the hip size. One thing nice about the truss is that you can remove the padding. So whatever side you have the hernia on, you can remove the opposite padding. It's just a matter of getting use to the tightness around the waist area in order to adjust the padding and straps correctly on the hernia to get the proper support. I'd probably go ahead with the surgery to correct the problem than to rely on wearing the belt for the rest of my life."
1,Terrible oboe reed,I guess for 8 bucks you can't expect much. Well that's certainly true in this case. An absolutely lousy oboe reed and no amount of scraping will make it decent. Bad responsiveness and flat top octave notes. Stay away is all I can say.
2,"Classy, mature slice of melodic hard progressive rock.","Well, this proves the Magicians are indeed back! While not quite up to heights of 1995's ""Sea Of Light"", these hard-proggin' survivors have crafted a very mature and diverse disc that begs comaprison to Rabin-era Yes. The production by Pip Williams (everyone from Moody Blues to Spice Girls) is sparkling, and the playing is world class. The only bummer is three ""radio friendly"" tracks that just wreck the flow of the otherwise superior melodic prog offerings. Forget about being commercial, guys, and the next one gets 5 stars."
1,Gross. Tastes like a burlap sack.,"These seeds were at a reasonable price and had 2 good reviews, so I ordered 2 bottles. They do not have any sesame flavor, as they smell and taste strongly of a burlap sack. I buy so much on amazon and go by the reviews, but never leave them myself. These were so bad, I felt it necessary because I am so displeased and wanted to warn others. I love adding sesame seeds to so much and this order was a lot of seeds and money just wasted."
2,Success Can be Learned,"Though Ogilvy on Advertising is a useful book, even today, it fails to deal with critical issues in the mid and late 1990s. Jon Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum have a good story to tell here, and lots to impart on how to not revert to institutional advertising. The agency has done excellent work outside the box for many clients, and reading how they accomplished that are good lessons to read indeed. I found it much more useful that many other ad books, like some mentioned above by Trout & Reis."
2,HE's BACK!,"It's been almost 2 years since the last release from Prince. He's back with a message in a totally different direction from his previous works. That's a good thing. Good jazz incorperated rock fusion CD. Reminds me of early Santana, Miles in the early 70's with a few touches of the neo-soul movement. Two things should have been eliminated to push this to a five star review... The slowed down narration voice almost at every break between songs, and that silly ""Wedding Feast"" snippet about food. Otherwise it's a pretty decent direction where Prince is taking his music now."
2,Works Great!,This product does exactly what it claims to do: froth skim milk quickly and effectively. A nice tool to have if you like some froth in your coffee.
2,Good story...,This was a different approach to a dramatic story of a serial killer -- it humanizes the victim and has great insight as to the stress those connected to the horrible crime suffer.
2,Best dog & cat brush you can buy.,"I have 5 dogs and 2 cats which generates a whole lot of pet hair! The FURminator is very effective in removing the undercoat and helps to eliminate shedding. I highly recommend it, and you will be amazed at how much hair you get after brushing your pets!"
1,Not worth $1.00,You get what you pay for. Paid $1.00 plus shipping. Wast of money. Does not work correctly with iPhone.
2,Real Eel Skin Cigarette Case,I am very happy with this product. I received quickly and it was just as promised. I plan on purchasing another after the first of the year.
1,Bushnell binoculars,Did not like these binoculars because something must be wrong with the lens. I would see double images and it would not focus correctly. I have another pair that was just 10x50 and they are much better than this one with no double vision or images.
1,Half of it doesn't work,"Only 2 slots work on the toaster. If u turn on the other ones it pops the outlet. Seems to have a short, will be returning it."
1,The Well Went Dry,"A horrific repackaging and rerecording of music that should have stayed in the vaults by a band that should have stuck with the music lessons. If you want to hear ""reel"" Celtic music, stay away from these imposters."
1,Couldn't believe how bad!,"I bought this radio to replace a non-digital SRF-88 which gave me many years of wonderful listening. That radio used a single ""AA"" Batter. This radio has great features, but someone at SONY forgot that people like to listen to radios. Compared reception with other portable radios I have. Used it indoors & outdoors. Exchanged radio for another. Reception in a big city with many clear stations unbelievably poor, constant static. FM reception expecially bad. I'll accept my loss and look for a new replacement."
1,falls flat,I live near Louisville...home of Churchill Downs. I started reading this just as Derby activities were getting in gear this year. Even with all the talk and interest in horse racing going on around me - I just couldn't get interested in this book. It is mostly plain old boring.The sections where P.G.'s stories are told are pretty good. You can get an idea of the kind of spitfire man he was. Other than that it is uninteresting.I gave up and asked my husband if he would like to read it. He tried too and wasn't able to wade through it either. It's not a long book..only 263 pages...small pages with big writing and big margins. Did I say boring ?
2,Sticks in your memory,"Some movies you forget soon after they end, but this one, which I saw several weeks ago, still seems like I just saw it.I've seen a few Iranian films lately, including ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" which was more intense but seemed manipulative, and ""The Circle,"" which somehow left me a little cold. This film was the most entertaining of the three, but was also more than just entertainment."
2,Extraordinary!,"I'll join the chorus of praise for this unique and lovely film. I will echo an earlier comment by a reviewer who stated he or she had been looking for this film for a long time. Indeed confirms what I have believed about love for so long. Watching this film was an emotional catharsis for me. Not in a long long time have I been so emotionally involved in a film from beginning to end. The acting, directing, SCENERY!-everything works like a charm. If you're a romantic like me this is the film for you. You'll be watching it over and over again for years to come. A classic of immense proportions."
1,poor quality Chinese junk,"this is a light weight plastic adapter that doesn't seem like it would last. I ordered the wrong one, seller wanted another $5 for shipping on top of my expense to ship it back to them. I found a Nintendo OE replacement for only a few bucks more. I'd suggest doing a bit more research and find an OE adapter rather than chancing it with the various cheap Chinese junk that's plentiful on Amazon"
2,Incredible,"Jane Eyre is a beautiful love story. That may sound like too simple a description for some, nevertheless, it is appropriate. If you want to read a truly classic novel that will leave you with a light heart and a smile, this is the book for you!"
2,Beautiful Music,"Excellent CD, a pleasure to listen to. Their new name is now Libera. They are all school children from South London Schools. I recommend this group to everyone."
2,"Thoughtful, beautiful film",I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater and can't wait to see it again on video. Fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and beautiful cinematography. It's a gem.
1,Garbage a waste of your time,This is pure racism and should be thrown in the dump where it belongs. It really takes a lot of effort to pick on teenage girls - bet they think they are tough.
1,Would not buy this product again..,"I had this product for a year now. The first few months it was great, then the problems started.Problem 1: I needed a new handle as it broke. I e-mailed Rival customer service to get a replacement piece (in black). They told me that the black handle was in stock and then proceeded to send me a white handle. I sent them several e-mails and never got a response.Problem 2: Unlike the previous review stating that the cooker just shuts off, my cooker just keeps on cooking it never switches to the warm cycle. The whole crock pot was extremely hot, I am now afraid to use it unless I am home, which defeats the whole purpose of using it.I could use any suggestions on which crock pot/slow cooker to purchase next. Any feedback would be helpful."
1,IMisleading packaging,"This is *not* a horse riding and care game. It's a linear adventure game about people at a riding academy for preteens and older kids who really like horses. I never got very far in this game (I was trying to figure it out for my daughter). I gave up in disgust very early because the interface was very hard for me to figure out and the manual was of no help.I suspect the preteen girl crowd would enjoy this game if it ran correctly, but the box is horribly misleading."
2,RELIABLE PRODUCT - RELIABLE COMPANY,"In the large number of envelopes we've orderd over the years there has not been one with a flaw. We rhink that's pretty good for an item that is undoubtedly mass produced. Obviously, we're well pleased with the product as we continue to order.Also, obviously we have not always done business with this company - wish we'd known about them sooner. Their service is prompt (a confirmation of order within 24 hours along with UPS tracking number). The envelopes are always well boxed so they arrive undamaged. Couldn't ask for more.We recommend both the envelopes and the company."
1,They have done way better,"It's very....blinkish. It's just not that good of a CD. There's no intensity at all, and that's a key element of punk music. I love Millencolin, don't get me wrong. But, it's what is in there other CDs that I love. I just hope this was an experimental CD and they aren't following the path of the Vandals who are going down hill. The Vandals last two CDs were so slow and not anything like ""Live Fast Diarrhea"" or ""the quickening"". These new sounds of punk bands are soundling like Blink 182, and Blink is just another boy band. And Blink, I can't stand at all"
2,Sleek and cheap,I used this mount for a DLP projector because I liked the price. The design can be improved to allow the tilt be 90 degrees. Still an extra fixture/adaptor can be an accessory for mounting DLP purpose. I made the adaptor by myself since I am an engineer. It works fine for my home theater. The screws are now long and strong -- imprevement from previous reviews.
1,Not very good...,"It starts like a horror movie, exemplified by dying Kane's melodramatic uttering of ""Rosebud"". It tells the story of Hearst-like character in flashbacks. His early successes ( the fact is that he was already rich to start with), marriage to a boring woman, his failure to win an election because of his devotion to his mistress and then I stopped watching, reminded me of those boring Lenin documentaries' that I watched as a kid in Soviet Russia - given that I had no choice and one Channel to reckon on with. Again you are fooled by stupid people who for reasons best known to them call a tabby cat ( Citizen Kane) a Lion ( any Satyajit Ray movie). Hearst was right to oppose this garbage, I would too, since it is so boring. It aint worth my two stars, but today I feel kind!!!"
1,Junk - Do not buy this cart,"Do not buy this cart. This cart broke the first time I used it.Samsonite Micro Mover Fold Away Luggage CartI loaded this cart with 2 carry-on items weighing approximately 15-20 pounds apiece - legal carry-on items, a soft small duffel bag and a backpack. The fitting that attached the leg on the cart broke as I turned away from the check-in counter at the airport. The leg was attached to the cart with a plastic fitting - the weak point on the cart. When the fitting snapped the cart was useless because the wheel was attached to the leg.I thought that this would be a good lightweight cart but the construction was too flimsy. If I were to consider a lightweight fold-up cart I would pay more for substantial metal fittings.I subsequently had to purchase a small metal cart for more money. However, it lasted the rest of the trip - several countries and many airports."
2,Sony battery,I received the battery in good time and in excellent condition. I am happy with the transaction.
2,Excellent genre!,"Up until I read this book, I only new of Harry Dresden from the short lived unconventional TV series a few years back, which I enjoyed.After reading the book, I have to say I am impressed. The book is even more enjoyable than the TV series, and takes a number of steps away from the traditional detective novel. Besides the obvious magic context, there is the hero who makes mistakes - mistakes where people get killed or injured (including Harry). Personal relationships are not neat little packages and mirror real life in many ways.What I liked:The character and the storyWhat I didn't likeThe price of the kindle book - same as the paperback, for an older book? Ugh. But that's okay, because I actually enjoyed the tactile sensation of reading a real paperback..."
2,Great Product,"I must admit that I am not completely through with the cds (I'm almost finished with cd 4 of 6), but mine must be an updated version since I seem to have the ability to skip through tracks on a single cd. It's a bit strange that there are NO instructions as to how to actually do the lessons (i.e. are we supposed to repeat once and then say it with the Italian person?). I would have appreciated one piece of paper with basic instructions. Also it's hard to learn the language without seeing it in writing (what will I do when I see it written in Italy?) but overall, the Italian speaker is very clear and speaks at a slow pace, and the English speaker sounds like he's a computer talking, but I think it's a good course. I'm going to complement it with the ""Italian for Dummies"" book to help me along. It's difficult to drive in LA while learning a language (or maybe the other way around). I like it though. I'd recommend it."
2,chill pad,"This chill pad is wonderful, my laptop keeps cool and is less expensive than other brands."
1,this thing is a joke,"Some things you should know that Amazon doesn't list: the two speakers are on the side, not the front, and they are only 3W. That's right, 3W. Hardly enough power for the smallest room. Also, it's powered by a ""wall wart"" AC adapter ... no decent stereo would be. It's made in China, big surprise. The ""wood grain"" is actually some sort of plastic coating, applied over plastic or cardboard. For $15 at a garage sale, it might be tolerable, but $95? Also, it makes a click noise through the speakers when you forward to another track. Whoever designed this atrocity should be embarassed. I'm embarassed at myself for buying it, I just want to save you the trouble of sending it back like I did."
1,No Assistance for Assistant Users,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book! Most of the tutorials in the book are geared toward Instructor users only. Often times, the tutorials will walk you through an operation that works in both Assistant and Instructor, but then you run into all of the steps for writing script (there is no script writer in Assistant) and the author does not provide alternative instructions for the same operation in Assisstant. I am muddling my way through and have ordered an Assistant hand book, but I am aggravated because I just spent $32.00 for this one and it's only a little more helpful than the book that came with the program itself!"
2,Very good with few week points,Overall the book was very informative however it didn't answer the question I wanted an answer to. If the Holy Spirit is God how come he doesn't know the time or date of the second coming. Overall though the book does a great job refuting many JW false teachings I definetly recommend this book.
2,Good book,"I enjoyed reading The Lost World. I liked reading about the adventures of people who visited the totally ficticious world. Since I didn't read much as a child, I am getting caught up with the books I should have read."
2,REALLY GOOD!,this book is sooo good! its about 4 girls and a guy and all of their problems. i could totally relate w/their situations. it even made me feel better about my problems!! u should definately get your hands on this book!
2,A Real Treat,"Everyone should read through this fascinating review of the many documented and undocumented trans-Atlantic crossings prior to 1492. It puts our ""school-book"" history in perspective. Very easy and interesting accounts of each of these crossings."
2,Perfect for my short lil girl,This potty was the one I wanted to use. It is an all in one. She is short and fits her well. She was ready to start training at 20 months. We are happy with it and have not had any problems like some of the other reviews.
1,confusing the little one,"my daughter absolutely adores elmo, but this dvd confused her a bit because while it features her favorite hero of all time the pace & introduction of themes are different than what she's accustomed to with regular episodes of elmo's world.small children are big on having routines, but when you take features they recognize then change the line up, it can throw the kids through a loop.so while i did feel the dvd presented the topic in a fun & educational manner, my daughter just didn't connect because it didn't have the typical elmo song/ask the noodles/ask dorothy/drawer/how can i find out more/end song.but then again every kid is an individual, so maybe your kid will get it or your kid won't."
1,"THE ""NO"" HEADACHE VISOR","THE ""NO""HEADACHE VISOR! GAVE ME A HEADACHE!!! THE DAY I RECIEVED IT,I TRIED IT ON. IT LOOKED REALLY CUTE, BUT WITH IN A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE! NOT TO MENTION IT LOOKED USED. BECAUSE I WORE IT OUT SIDE TO SEE IT IN THE SUN, IT SEEMED LIKE IT HAD STAINS ON IT, ALSO IT HAD LITTLE BALLS. LIKE WHEN SOMEONE HAS ALREADY WORE IT! AND ITS BLACK! IT SO MUCH GROSSED ME OUT!I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!! I ALSO TRIED EMAILING THE COMPANY AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT. AND AS OF TODAY, I HAVENT HEAD FROM THEM!! THEY NEED TO BE REPORTED TO BBB! THEY NEED HELP IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM OR REFER THEM TO ANYONE!!"
1,Pretty but fragile,"Love the look, but it stopped working within a Month of daily use ... not worth the price"
2,great book,This book describe how to change your thinking or views on situation that most people are not raise with. This book has help me to stop and think and make changes about myself. Which has helped with how I react in my marriage. I am reading it over just to keep the advise in my thoughts so I don't go back to my old habits of thinking.
1,Worst Madden ever,I have purchased and enjoyed every Madden title until this one. Do not believe the hype that is behind it. Either stick with 2004 or get NFL 2K5.I would suggest renting the game before even considering buying. I am glad I kept my receipt.
2,Great knife for the price and sharp as can be!,"I finally purchased this paring knife in red, my favorite color, though all the other colors were gorgeous, also.Man, is this knife SHARP!Now, I value all 10 fingers so I was ultra careful when I finallyused it on some strawberries.The knife went through the berries like a hot knife going throughbutter.I would recommend this knife to anyone, though, sadly, it is madein China. I would aslo recommend wearing mesh steel gloves when youuse these knives. (I am saying that tongue in cheek but they are sharp,ladies so be ultra careful when you use them.)The knife is pretty, functional, not overly costly and does the jobever so nicely."
1,All New???,"I bought this book thinking I would finally learn some new techniques, such as how get a 3-D effect using one-stroke. But like most of Donna's books, there is a lot of repeated material, so ""all new"" is misleading. The only ""new"" part of the book is a few projects that you can do -- once you buy the new Plaid products required! So, there's very little to learn from in this book. And, one problem I have with Donna: her step-by-step directions on how to do things often do not lead to the finished product displayed. I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who can provide some better one-stroke instruction."
2,Greatest Gift,I bought this cd for my sister. She is the biggest Stewart fan I know. This is one of the best investments I made because of the happiness that came to my sister. Any MAN that can make music like this has got to be a keeper. Keep on making great music. Love ya Rod!!!
2,Quality component,I bought this for a 2006 Hyundai Elantra. It fits perfectly and works perfectly. This is a lot easier and more reliable then trying to splice together a generic sensor. Get this one. It fits and it works great!
2,Great Product but out of production,These are the only khaki pants I have worn for several years; I've been really happy with the relaxed fit which allows for maneuverability. My greatest disappointment is that Wrangler is no long producing these pants. Amazon was my last available source and now you are out of stock in my size. I've found a close replacement for fit from Oak Hill a product carried by Casual Male.
1,Poor Software Quality,"Kaplan TOEFL CBT tests are really buggy and scores are not accurately calculated:1. The program does not recognize correct answers where more than one answer has to be chosen.2. The program does not retain the essay.2. When shifting from the general test feedback section to a specific section analysis (reading, listening or structure) and back again to the general feedback section, all the scores for the test change. You have to go back to the Main Menu to retrive the original scores for the test.3. When re-taking the same test for a second time, the whole program locked and I could not verify my answers."
2,Indiana Jones,"After seeing the new Indiana Jones movie, it made me want to go back and see the originals again. They are as good as I remembered. Also, it was great to watch these DVDs on a big screen with an upconventing DVD player. It was almost like your were at the movies again."
2,walking dead is suspenseful viewing,I never thought I would watch or like a zombie show...Walking Dead is a thriller...looking forward to more of this show
2,"If your hard core furry fan, you'll like this",An excelent book with plenty of worth while pictures in it. but it is not 100% furry though with two of the artists not having a single furry pic in their section
1,BEWARE...,"Both my sister and I ordered this dress, and we ended up with two different dresses entirely. She received the dress pictured, I received one made like it with a different CHEAPER material. This picture looks really cute, like the dress is full and gathered, when in fact it isnt either one of those things. There is no gather in the front, and it does not have any fullness to it at all, it is no different than the princess nightgowns you would see at the store. I was VERY VERY disappointed when I received this dress. I would have returned it, but it was a gift for my daughter for Christmas, and I did not have time to get another one. I would NOT purchase this dress again, it was complete misrepresentation."
2,Just want I expected,"This product works perfect. Easy to set-up, easy to store, easy to carry, easy to start, all around very simple and perfect for what it is for. The only downside I experienced was trying to use 2 medium/large pans on it at once. I could do it, but I had to take down one of the wind shields. It was kind of windy at the time, but the burners still stayed lit, so obviously it was not much of a problem.This thing gives off plenty of heat and is so easy to start, use and set-up with no tools required. I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,"Insipid, banal, and badly written","This book was so predictable, dull, and uninteresting that I didn't even finish it. Like the juvenile novelization of a B-grade fantasy movie. I just couldn't bring myself to care what silly thing happened to those dull - not dull, downright *stupid* characters. Give me Robin McKinley or Tad Williams any day."
2,Very typical work from Hawtin et al.,"A good Richie Hawtin record is like a good Cocteau Twins record. You basically know what you're getting into. Both surprises and disappointments are rare. If his music is what you like, you'll like this. Trippy, minimalist techno grooves that move both minds and booties. I think I must have 3 or 4 copies of ""Loop,"" his collaboration with LFO (Low Frequency Oscillation), on various comps, but hey, it does stand up to repeated listening. If an introduction to this style is what you want, I'd recommend Hawtin's import comp ""Selections"" to start, and this to dig deeper."
1,Eh! Well beyond it's prime now...,"This was a great tool years ago, but Ulead got bought by Corel and now they only offer a full DVD image/video packaged named DVD MovieFactory with much more capabilities.Corel DVD MovieFactory 6.0 Plus"
1,Speed Train Your Own Bird Dog,"I returned this book the day I rcvd it. All it took is for me to flip through the pages and see the trainer recommending giving a knee to teach the dog not to jump up and then the very disturbing picture of him teaching ""whoa"" using a rope thrown over a tree while tied to the dogs neck while standing on a barrel.I have worked around horses and dogs for many years and certainly advocate force when necessary. However, I feel that there are many more ways to train a dog than using the types of methods mentioned above-hence why I returned it."
2,this cd is right there on top,im a huge cars fan and just like any cars fan knows if there is no ric there no cars his voice and style made the band if your a cars fan this cd is for you
2,Overall A very Good Tape but.....,"The episodes that are included on this tape are very good, but I miss the ones like ""Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth"". If that had been on this tape, it would be an easy five star rating. A more enjoyable 2 hours is not likely to be had while viewing any other comedy tape."
2,Key pieces of church history brought to life in our day.,"This is a key book for our day as it will inform our generation of what happened with the Moravians & Count Zinzendorf, but not only what happened, but why. Jim Goll has the ability to see & hear from the heavenly perspective, and bring the past into the future. You will learn in this book that dry bones can live again."
1,Trade it for a better one,"The editor's review was too kind. This book features a dumber-than-rocks protagonist, an inane plot, and inept character development. Don't waste your time."
1,Wrong trance CD ever,This is probably the worst trance CD I've ever heard.The only thing this CD has going for it is a strong continuous (if not mind numbingly boring) beat.
1,"Great beginnings, poor finish","I loved this book when I started reading it. I love the strong female character, the time setting and her family. It made for a very interesting story. But then it all fell apart. She became a sappy female, learning of family and friends secrets page after page after page after page. While the author sets the stage for more books, I don't think I will buy it."
1,Not Bossy Enough,"There really isn't all that much when it comes to good party songs, and even as good hip hop songs. That has been the case with Kelis. Although she need a infectious groove with Milkshake a few years ago, her latest single doesn't actually capture the status she had before. Bossy, the first single from her upcoming record Kelis Was Here is a very weak song that doesn't deliver very well. The song isn't anything over the top where you could dance to the music and enjoy it. Although it is fair at first, it just gets quickly tiresome. This is really one of the very few tracks that isn't what it delivers as bossy.Song: D+"
2,"Small Ears, Rejoice!!","As someone with small ears, finding earbuds is really difficult. These earbuds are the perfect solution for those with small ears that want a set that has a mic for the iPhone. I've been using them for a week now, and I've got to say that these are the best set of earbuds I've ever owned. Not only is the sound great, but they feel substantial, meaning I don't fear them breaking on me.So there isn't an answer/end button. I screen calls anyway."
2,Fast Order,I ordered this item and given a specific date for arrival. The day before this item arrived
2,Highly recommended,"AFter trying for 18 mos, I finally just bought this monitor, even though I was really skeptical about the cost. After two months I was pregnant, I never even had to buy more refill sticks."
2,You won't be able to put this one down....,"If you have any interest at all in forensic investigations, like to watch CSI, Foresnsic Files, Cold Case Files or Law and Order, this book is a MUST BUY. I literally could not put it down until I was finished! Easy read, ten case files that will have you riveted page after page. Ends with blunders in investigations."
2,Mostly about the Frame,"Lots of information of good information on the frame, variations on the frame, building the frame, etc. The mat and mount sections seemed a bit light, but the information was good. I would say the mat and mount section was on the beginner side but framing ran well into the intermediate range. Overall a decent book but not quite great unless you are more interested in builing your own frames."
2,Horsin' around!,I get a ton of compliments on this stylish necklace. I plan on giving one to each of my groomsmen before my wedding ceremony.
2,The best studio album,"Okay, everyone bought this in 1975 for Bohemian Rhapsody. That, in and of itself, makes this album a great buy. If you don't know a lot about Queen, you might be in for a bit of a suprise by the whole album. Queen always dabbled in experimentation with music and vocals. They basically covered everything from rock to country to disco. Casual fans would want to get Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits. The true fans always have this one ready to go."
2,Fantastic Trilogy in multi-channel audio,"As the title says - this is an MVI DVD set. It is not DVD-A. That aside, as others have said more profusely, this is an awesome rendition of the original disks. Pretty much more than any other artist, I enjoy Donald Fagan (and Steely Dan) in multi-channel audio. I was very familiar with the 2-channel versions when they came out, and the detail and nuances of the remastering are well worth the price of entry. It is just magical when you turn up the volume and just listen."
1,Manual horrible,Who wrote a manual for this thing. It's impossible to comprehend. At the end you'll figure out how to use this timing device on your own. But manual should have been written by more intelligent people.
2,Travel Humor at its Best,"Edited by Doug Lansky, author of Up the Amazon Without a Paddle, There's No Toilet Paper on the Road Less Traveled can really be appreciated by those who have actually made the same mistakes. If you have then you'll be in good company with humorous travel accounts from Steve Martin, Dave Barry, David Letterman, Dennis Miller and Fran Lebowitz. If you haven't made the same cultural faux pas then you can at least sit back and have a good laugh at those who have. Two personal favorites include, ""Nudity is a State of Mind"" by Alan Zweibel and ""Under the Spell of a Witch Doctor"" by Rory Nugent. There's No Toilet Paper... on the Road Less Traveled is truly good travel humor at its best."
2,"""Humbling.""","When I first saw this book, I was intrigued because it was about Irish people. I find Irish people interesting, and therefore concluded that this book would be also. As soon as I began reading ""Angela's Ashes"" I could not put it down. This book is moving, touching, and as I said in the title of my review, humbling. I read the second book, ""Tis, A Memoir"", and I have the upmost regard for Frank McCourt. I will steadfastly wait for another novel from Mr. McCourt. I thank him for sharing his past with us, and now feel more appreciative for my life."
1,What was this all about?,"Okay, this guy is not who he thinks he is but everyone else in town seems to know his true identity. What his famiily does not know is what he did to them years earlier. Um...yeah. This could have been better but it is just dull."
2,Appreciative Inquiry,"I love these ""thin books"" and glad to know there are other people like me who believe you can get your point across in less than 200 pages! This little book has BIG ideas and concepts. I received the book three days after placing my order. Great resource. I will read Appreciative Inquiry regularly."
2,Long overdue exercise review,"I enjoy this tape very much. It has been some time since I have exercised and I have some arthritis and health issues, so I thought this workout tape would be a good place to start.I have been doing the "" 1 mile walk 5 days a week for about 2 weeks now, and enjoy it very much. I feel like I have more energy and hope to in the near future been able to do the "" 2 mile walk.Thank you Leslie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Piece of Junk!,"When I first placed the (brand new) batteries in and turned in on, I thought it was pretty good; it is easy to use and the measurements are precise. However, when I turned it off and tried to turn it back on again, it wouldn't turn on (unless I remove the batteries and put them back in again). I was too lazy to return it then, so I decided to keep it. Two days later, I tried to use it again, and this time it wouldn't turn on at all! I tried replacing the batteries with a set of new ones and it turned on...the machine ate up my batteries in just two days!! This is when I decided to send it back. It is now on its way back ..."
1,Vedder and the Blowfish?,"Self-importance is no longer the premium it once was in the music world...PJ is no longer vital, if they ever were. Once their mediocrity filled a void...now it's just the void itself. It's sad because they're true believers."
1,No difference from stock filter,"I bought this for my 2008 VW Rabbit, hoping to get some sort of performance or efficiency bump. The result was nothing different from stock.Fuel economy is the same, performance feels the same.The only open question is whether this has a longer life than a stock filter. If so, it might justify the cost. Otherwise, it's not worth it."
2,Cute Doris Day Comedy,"Doris Day and James Garner had a wonderful chemistry, first-evidenced when Universal paired them in THE THRILL OF IT ALL!, a bubbly romantic comedy about the tenacious power balance between husband and wife.Beverly Boyer (Doris Day) is a devoted wife and mother who suddenly finds nation-wide fame as the star of the ""Happy Soap"" TV commercials. Her successful obstetrician husband Gerald (James Garner) finds himself thrust into the position of being ""Mr Beverly Boyer"" as their marriage and private-life careens into a media frenzy. Can marriage survive life in the spotlight?...Adorable romantic comedy with Doris Day at the top of her form. The Boyer children are played winningly by Brian Nash and Kim Karath (best-remembered as little Gretl in ""The Sound of Music""). The cast also includes Arlene Francis, Elliott Reid, ZaSu Pitts and Edward Andrews. This was one of the first major screenplays by Carl Reiner, following years of solid TV comedy writing."
1,Characters are undeveloped,"This is a fun read but not a very well told tale. The characters aren't very emotionally fleshed out. For instance, the lead character's mother despises him, but his actions don't seem to warrant it. Likewise, the son hates the lead character but the lead's behavior didn't seem to warrant that either. And, the lead character is described as ruthless by others, but the author doesn't really paint him that way. The end is also less than believable. I bought the book on the discount table at Borders but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it."
2,Fun JD Robb mystery with her great twists,"If you like the J.D Robb mysteries, you will enjoy this story. Quick read, but includes all of her twists and challenges. I enjoyed that it was also ""out of this world"". :)"
2,Nice,"Pretty nice stuff. Illustrator with direct Flash support, but without filters. Illustrator 10 is buggy though. Take your pick."
2,An Almost Great Collection!!,"This is another situation where I'd love to rate this collection with the most stars available, because I am an avid fan of this kind of music. I perform it myself. However, the choice of Joe Cocker to see the poorly arranged ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird"" was a grave disappointment, and took away from the overall collection. Not only did it betray the composer's intent, Cocker didn't even include the introduction to the song, which is vital to understanding the tune.There are standouts, for sure, such as Jimmy Durante, Louis Armstrong, Harry Connick, Jr., and Celine Dion, of course. She is not over-rated as some have suggested. She fits perfectly with this collection, and a great surprise is the presence of Dr. John. He is such a great artist and performer. I wanted to hear more of his stylings.A great collection, if only you can skip over Joe Cocker!!!"
2,been seeking this for awhile,The beginning match is kinda messed up as far as the tape quality but it's the Piper/Mountie match and already have it on DVDs. Other then that everything is up to par.
1,review,This product came to me broken and was not what I expected! I would not recommend this product to anyone!
2,my thoughts on 'salem's lot,"It all starts in a tiny little town in Maine called Jerusalem's Lot. Where everything looks nice and the people are nicer. Then things start going wrong after two mysterious people move into the Marsten House. People go missing, they dont show up for work, they start feeling very sick...So five locals get together to figure out what is going on.I thought this was a very good book. I could barely put it down. I hope this review helps you decide to read it because it is an awesome book. There are many twists in the plot and it keeps you guessing."
1,Bad Product,"Has a really Bad Odor. And my Little Toys often get lost while using this. The pump is also alittle too loose. Needs to be a warming gel so that it can be applied to cold areas and then heat up. Is that a summer sausage in my pocket, or am I happy to see you?"
1,second rate book,this book is second rate garbage as is the movie. stupid and pointless the author v c andrews has created a work of crap
