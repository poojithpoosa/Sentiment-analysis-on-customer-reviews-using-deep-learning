2,"Nice strap, would buy again","The look of this strap is very nice. It has a sharp appearance that blends in with my Sunburst Strat without looking drastic to distract you from the guitar.It's very comfortable, and adjustable to virtually any length you could want.The fabric has a slight tendency to buckle a little, so its not a perfectly flat strap... but it is nicely padded, so I guess thats why it buckles. This is not a problem, though. I like this stap a lot and would buy it again."
2,Good back-up light,"I have four of these and I use them on my house. The flashlight is of a useful brightness and the emergency light aspect is excellent on a region where power sometimes goes out at night.The plug is not polarized, so you can point the night light portion up or down, and I do both. The plug position is such that the light covers both power outlets if you have an inline 2 power outlets faceplate, thus rendering the other power outlet useless. This is the only reason I did not give a 5-star review."
1,Don't Buy,"Typical Chinese product, failed in less that 6 months. Seems to be bad connection between switch and lamp base. Contacted seller, NO RESPONSE."
2,Works,We have used this product for some time and it has never failed to do the job. I always like to keep some on hand.
1,What's love got to do with it?,That's how I felt about this book. There was no love involved between any of the characters. It was more of an obsession and lust than the need to love and be loved. I felt that Samone was lacking as a character. The author concentrated more on complicating the plot rather than develop the characters mindset. I was greatly disappointed in this book.
2,A rich chocolate confection for the soul.,"I was mesmerized by the writing, able to only read a few pages at a time, before my heart was so full I couldn't read more, every line was memorable. a real treasure."
1,sucky,"OK, so Melanie Rawn's other series were good. Then I read this series, only to be shocked. I had to plow my way through the book. The only interesting parts were the treacheries and the like, and the abductions, etc. But overall, this whole series could not hold my attention, and let me tell you, if I'm reading a good book, my attention doesn't wander at all. Come on, when reading this series, it took about 4-6 weeks to read it, instead of the usual couple days. But maybe I shouldh've started with the 2nd book, like I did with all other Melanie Rawn series. I hope I never have to read it again, and that is an unusual comment for me."
1,It's just plain bad...,"Having read a handful of reviews prior to watching this, my bar was set pretty low but this failed to elicit even a chuckle. The movie rapidly sways between American Pie caliber phallic jokes (which fall flat) and painfully dry Lifetime-level relationship drama; I have no idea what kind of viewer they had in mind when they made this thing. Save your time and money, and watch any prime-time half hour comedy at random, which is sure to provide the same level of entertainment. The scenery was the single redeeming item here. Watching this during a sub-zero Northeast winter provided a bit of vicarious warmth."
1,Wrong Item Sent,"The wrong item was sent to me. The item sent is useless to me. They want me to UPS it back to them before they send me the correct item. This means that I have to go out to a UPS store and send it. They should have sent the UPS to my house to pick it up with a tag. They should have sent out the right item no matter what. I paid for the item, I should receive the item I ordered. We are talking a 5.00 item. I am not happy with this merchant at all."
1,unrated version,"the other reviewer must have seen the xxx version ,this is the unrated version .if you like softcore porn and comedy i would recommend this however the movie is not so nice,i would avoid this movie like the tears of gypsies"
1,A Travesty,"If you like the version of the song at the end of Donnie Darko, you will hate the dance remix on this CD. There is a video (crappy) for the version from the movie, and watching that with your eyes closed is the only pleasant thing to do with this CD single."
1,Unhappy Birdhouse,I was very disappointed with the construction of the birdhouse.It needs to have an opening to clean the house out after the birds nest. The hanger was not sturdy enough to hang. This was broken when I received it.
2,"Brilliant, though sometimes a rehash or older material","This BBC documentary is as impressive visually as ever, and if you haven't seen Planet Earth or The Blue Planet, it'll definitely wow you. However, there's not that much new in here, though there is a greater effort spent in linking the event to how it affects the different species. Would have liked to see new events, such as the butterfly migration in America; right now, it mostly comes across as material that's been done before. Still visually stunning, but not particularly new."
1,painfully annoying.,"although this cd has recieved its fair share share of radio air-space, it is still poor. I am always stunned at how people can put up with the vocals, the blokes voice is hideous. The band is also poor live. All in all a sub standard cd and generally over rated."
1,Limited usefulness,"This product does not live up to its claims. It arrived at my home with a prominent dent in the front panel. Despite the damage, it did work, but not for every use that it is intended. It crushes ice sufficiently to be used in the bottoms of serving trays to keep food items cold, but does not even come close to crushing ice small enough to be used in frozen drinks."
1,Not worth the read..,This book is definitely not worth the read. It should be noted that it is written by an AT Kearney dude and as an ex-EDSer I can see the resemblance of the consultants that made all consultants look bad. It had no substance but choose to use big words and complex evolved scenarios to provide the pretence of intelligence. It is everything bad about a pompous consultant roled into a book. Please note that the positive reviews of this book are all from the Dallas / Fort Worth area which is home to the AT Kearney legions. I gave it a 2 only because all reading is positive and it started off good.
2,Great for beginners.,Very good video. Explains movements so you can understand. Good for beginers and more advanced.
2,Voice of My Island,"After meeting Stephen at a pub in Scotland once he finished singing, I had to buy this CD! I continue to listen to it on a regular basis, as his music brings me one step closer to the misty isle."
2,Saved me from lots of grief,"I read The Partnership Charter as I was about to enter into a partnership to start a business requiring large amounts of startup capital which I had almost finished raising. Upon reading this great book, I realized that my partner was not the one to do this venture with and I pulled out at the last minute. I thank David and this book for saving me from a great deal of anguish and aggravation. Had I entered into this partnerhip, I would have ended up doing the lion's share of the work and would have had to break up the partnership."
2,FANTASTIC purchase,"This slicer is an excellent buy. My wife and I bought it so we could slice our own homemade bread, and lunch meat (as we like to control what goes in our food... no preservatives). I was a little skeptical at first, b/c the price seemed too good to be true. This machine proved me wrong. The range of slice thickness is amazing, from paper thin to inches thick. It slices with ease, and is wonderfully easy to take apart to clean. I would highly recommend this slicer to anyone who is considering purchasing one!"
1,sketchy concept overview w/ many wrong answers.......,"I grabbed this book from my local library to do some brushing up on some old high school concepts before reviewing some more serious calculus. There is very little intuitive development for what ""may"" be intended as prep material for standardized tests such as the ACT or GRE. For example, the proofs for geometrical volumes or surface areas are laughable at best,if existent at all. As an electrical engineer, I feel very confident in the answers I obtained...especially after double checking my own scratch work. I am seriously considering writing my own book based on the material that was thrown into this one....."
1,not the bargen i thought,"the add does not show the optional spline or sds drive shankes needed for this tool the're expensive! now i have to weld a broken spline shank i saved ,not everyone can do this.i,m not happy i suggest you change the add"
2,Great buy,"Wanted this book since we recently moved to NH and live near Exeter - where the prep school is based. Good quality, as expected. Great buy."
2,"Use often, great even after 4 years of use.",I've had this stock pot for 4 years and it still looks brand new and works great. Often times in the winter I make two batches of soup at the same time so I purchased a second one about a year ago. Couldn't be happier.
1,Ummm...no.,"What is up with that ridicuolous ""prego rap""?! And the 5 mintues of silent time where all we see is kathy & the others laying on the floor for 5 WHOLE MINUTES! There are parts where the voice is dubbed over, the exercises were not effective AT ALL & the arm moves get a bit confusing at times. I just didn't find myself sweating or even feeling somewhat energized after this routine...I felt cheated. Like I needed more. It is way too outdated too. I almost wanna call it lame. I DO NOT recommend at all. Obviously I wasn't impressed & will be selling my copy on ebay."
2,Great Beginning to Wealth Building,"If you like reading an informative book that teaches rather than preaches, this book is for you.I expected Kim to tell me the steps she took to start investing in real estate, along with the pros and cons, but she went one step better. She sidestepped the stiff, one-person approach in favor of educating me through the eyes and stories of a multi-women reunion.You find yourself trying to identify with one of the women, but even if you cannot, you quickly and easily learn wealth-building steps throughout the chapters. Some situations seem extraneous, but that made sense, too, because life doesn't stop while you learn the ins and outs of real estate buying.If you're ready to build wealth through real estate, you'll keep reading to the end. And then, if you're serious about moving forward, you'll be motivated to proceed just like Kim."
2,"CONVENIENT, EASY, and QUALITY ALL IN ONE!",This camera offers it all in a lightweight and compact camera. Canon has done a wonderful job with this one. I have taken it with me everywhere I go and it's so light you sometimes forget you have it. The quality of the pictures have also been excellent and I have had no problems with red eye. I liked it so much I just bought another for a friend. Excellent!
2,this game rocks!!!!!!,"This game packs plenty of dodge and shoot action. And it has action/adventure, so if you like that you will like this game. This is a good place to buy it I should know I have the game. Oh yeah I almost forgot(trust me on this don't get this game off of EBAY)... I'm going to let you know this but ""MegaMan blue vesion"" is a little harder than ""MegaMan white vesion""Salim ta-ta"
2,I love this video!,"I purchased Jane Fonda Prime Time: Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio and Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone & Flex CDs at the same time. So glad I did. I have been alternating the videos, which are very different.I selected the full 40 minutes of workout time on each video and realized how out of shape I was. Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio was the toughest. Perspiration was running down the sides of my face along with a full body sweat. Phew! Trim Tone & Flex truly works most muscles in the upper and lower body. I can tell which muscles are the strongest or weakest. I am definitely on my way to a healthier me.Thanks Jane for thinking of people that are really out of shape or need to bounce back from a health issue! These videos fit both.Amazon is a great online store to work with. Received my products intact and new. My favorite store online."
1,Didn't work for long,"I have two boys, 7 and 2, both thumb-suckers. At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs. My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he'd fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway. My 2-year-old wants to suck his thumb constantly. I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again. I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!"
1,Ani's Worst Album,"She's been on a downslide for the last couple of years, but to judge by this cd its getting worse. She tries to ryhme words with themselves, she continues on the completely mined-out vein of politically complaining that has replaced all her other subject matter lately, she's forgotten any way to show emphasis or go for emotional impact other than just repeating the first verse as the last verse, apparently...I can't find a good thing to say about this one, which is a real shame because Ani is one of the only artists out there today who could fairly and without exaggeration be called both a poet and a geniusShe needs to take some time off and get some new material and new inspiration though, and until she does I'm afraid all her cds will be as bad as, or worse than, this one. I would give it zero stars if i could"
1,Bushnell binoculars,Did not like these binoculars because something must be wrong with the lens. I would see double images and it would not focus correctly. I have another pair that was just 10x50 and they are much better than this one with no double vision or images.
1,Is This Book A Joke?,"Love vitamins? Love tanks?? LOVE TANKS !?! Oh, please... I am so glad I borrowed this book from the library. They can have it back."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Once again Don Warnner of Rising Sun Productions DECEIVES the buyer,the cover states iaido and shows a prominent Sensei of Toyama Ryu, Seiji Ueki Sensei all over the cover and disc itself,BUT NOWHERE AND ,I REPEAT NOWHERE DOES UEKI SENSEI APPEAR IN THIS VIDEO ,OR IS THER ANY INSTRUCTION IN CLASICAL IAIDO !!,This is just poor management of a company and an effort to deceive to make sales, very sad indeed.In my opinion mr. Warnner is a man of no Budo and misrepresents to make a buck! THIS IS JUST A COPY OF NIHON KENDO KATA !!! BUY THAT INSTEAD !!!Although the video itself is great for the material it contains , it should have been marketed acurately, VERY SAD don VERY sad!>>>>>"
1,Pitbulls are not good pets,"I love animals and bought this book thinking it would share some heartwarming stories about rescued dogs and the situations that arise when they enter your life. What I got was a book about Pitbulls. The flap (very misleadingly) says the book contains stories about all kinds of dogs but in reality this book is only about Pitbulls. I'm not sure why anyone would want to own a Pitbull,even your homeowner's insurance may cost you more as a Pitbull (or Rottweiler) owner, and the breed is statistically proven to have an aggressive behavior. One section of the book describes a situation where 2 dogs get into a vicious fight and the author has to intervene. That is not a ""pet"" I would want my children or friends or neighbors around. I was very disappointed in this book and felt it was lobbying to entice people into owning a vicious animal and consider it a pet.On the other hand, if you want a good book with heartwarming stories, read ""What the Dog Did""."
2,My Students Love This!,"As a Title 1 teacher, I see groups of 3-5 kids in blocks of 30 minutes to 1 hour per day. My students love to be assigned a part(or two). Most stories have 5-6 speaking parts, and all of the stories have some sort of a moral. The reason why my students seem to enjoy these plays so much is that they get a chance to ""shine"" in these high interest tales.A regular teacher with a larger class could effectively use this book during a center time activity, or at any time when groups are split up during a language arts block. This book will breathe a bit of fresh air into your lesson plans!"
2,Great for use on a slide board,I needed to make a melamine surface slippery for training on a speed skating slide board and this product worked perfectly.
2,An overwhelmingly positive view of Christian sexuality.,"This book is probably the single best evangelical marriage manual on the market, complete with explicit but tastfully done drawings and unflinching examinations of various sexual issues. The contextualizing of sex into the larger sphere of marital relationships is especially helpful; communications between husband and wife about sex or anything else can be greatly improved if one heed's Rosenau's parameters for communication."
2,A thoughtful look at the romance genre.,"This is a great collection of scholarly essays by well-known romance authors about the genre. Any serious romance fan will find this a fascinting read. I was continually impressed by the profound insights in this book. Not only is it a compelling response to the many unenlightened critics of the genre, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of how romance novels reflect the changing face of women's issues in this country. I particularly enjoyed the article by Susan Elizabeth Phillips called ""The Romance and the Empowerment of Women."" Also, Laura Kinsale's article about how readers respond to the point of view of the narrative was fascinating. This should be mandatory reading for all romance editors."
1,No romance!,This book is not worth spending your money on. It lacked romance and not once did it mention the heroe loving the heroine it only mentions him loving his stepmother and his obsession with her. I wish i could give this book negative stars.
2,highly recommend!,"I love most of Ann O'Leary books, very passionate, romantic love stories. This one is certainly one of her best books I've ever read. If you are looking for a real and heart touching love story then this is a must read book!"
1,bad order,i order a new 14 speed oster blender from literrallyamazing an they sent me a use on unto now i cant get back one because i mention i am from the caribbean that make the seller happy i am not there to get ma claim i couldn't use that old thing with plenty marksi will not order no used item
1,Poor quality....broke it within minutes!,"The steamer works that's why it got 2 stars. The attachments are of poor quality and mine broke just as I started doing the floor. I would recommend this for doing tubs, toilets, small things only."
1,Dont Get This...,"i bought this guitar for $230...not woth anything. i brought it to my local guitar center, and they said they would give me $50 for it. this guitar sucks."
1,choking hazard?,"My five month-old loves this little bee; however, he can get the blue ""wing"" all the way into his mouth. Because of its shape, he has trouble pulling it out and chokes on it. I didn't use it for a long time because it was too heavy for him and it looks like I'll be putting it up again. The choking really scared me."
2,"Common insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals","Part the Interlink Books ""Travellers' Wildlife Guides"" series, Peru provides identification and location information on Peru's most frequently seen animals. This 502 page identification guide offers full-color illustrations of more than 500 of Peru's most common insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Enhanced with a species index, Peru provides up-to-date information on the ecology, behavior and conservation of the animals listed, as well as information on Peru's habitats and the most common plants visitors will encounter. With brief descriptions of Peru's most frequently visited parks and wildlife reserves, this handy, highly portable manual will prove to be an invaluable companion for appreciating the diversity and wonderful of Peruvian wildlife in their native settings."
2,Helpful workbook,"Wipe Clean Activity Work Book (Wipe Clean Activity Books)A wide range of activities including dot to dot, letter, number and shape tracing, counting trucks, animals or bugs, Mazes, writing words, word search, upper and lower case letters. Use over and over. What could be better?"
1,BORING,"I am very much an Anita Blake fan, despite her nerve-wracking immaturity. I agree with some of the reviewers here that this book was pretty boring. I didn't feel the plot was great and WHEN is the ardeur going to calm down? Has Laurell decided that she's going to write sex scenes without a good story? I am so happy that I stopped buying these books and now get them from the library because I would consider this a waste of money."
2,sentimientos a flor de piel. simply the best.,"poseo todos sus cds, incluido el ultimo ""gente"", y aunque este no es su mejor disco (todos los artistas maduran musicalmente con cada nuevo trabajo), canciones como ""me das el mar"" y ""alma de blues"" irradian tal poesia y belleza que se te quedan grabadas en la cabeza y no puedes olvidarte de su letra y melodia. Por supuesto si buscas los tipicos ritmos calientes (salsa, merengue..) este disco no es para ti. FIRST CLASS ONLY.Todos los discos posteriores a este son simplemente obras maestras."
1,Worst Software Package that I've ever bought.,"I upgraded my office 2003 with the new Office 2007 just a couple of months ago. I've been a Microsoft fan for a long time but needless to say, I've never been as disappointed with any software upgrade as I was with this one. Everything takes at least 3 times as long, it takes forever to get used to, and simple commands such as ""word count"" take forever to find. I've been happy with Microsoft software updates up to this date, but I'm amazed that a company such as this would alienate its customer base this way!!..If you're thinking about buying this package...I strongly recommend you to find something else!!!"
1,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I was looking for an inexpensive, but functional, bird feeder for my 8 year older bird-loving daughter. This looked like a great product. I liked the design of 3 distinct levels, but the construction was shoddy. The side seams were badly molded, leaving gaps. Also, the roof was missing altogether in my shipment. So while I like the idea of this feeder, I wasn't pleased with the actual item. I am, however, very pleased with Amazon's no-hassle return service. I guess I'll hope for better luck next time."
1,Washed out photos - poor quality for a kodak,"I got this camera as a christmas gift this year and was fairly pleased. I had been shopping around for a camera to make slideshows with, and my parents very generously bought one for me. I am no expert in photography, but I know when a camera takes bad pictures. I have an olive skin tone and green eyes, and the pictures completely washed out my skin, leaving only my eyes with color. Also, pictures of subjects farther away than 28"" came out dark and/or washed out as well. The color saturation is overwhelming, and I just couldn't take it. After a few trade ins between a couple other cameras I have finally stuck with a Sony Cyper-shot, which is a good camera. The kodak C330 is good for those who are looking for a bargain, and don't care about true to color skin tones. But if you'd like to save a hundred dollars, stick with Kodak's disposable cameras and you'll get better pictures."
2,A glimpse of reality!,"I just want to say a special thaks to Lorenzo, for his confrontation and courage in writing the book. I hope the very best for him, n hope he remains in tranquility!"
1,couldn't get it to work well,Be careful of this product. It drops the signal too much for my Samsung to recognize the signal and for the couterpart Sharp to recognize either.
1,Sound quality so horrible it's not worth listening to,I have to say I love George Acosta. The first time I listened to this album I thought there was something wrong with the cd. Eventually I figured out this was how the cd was actually produced. I have dj'd before and understand that some of my records might sound bad from wear and tear but I couldn't believe the horrible sounds coming from my speakers when playing this album. Get ANY of his other cd's besides this one!
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I loved The Baker's Boy series. I bought this one, hoping that it would be the same. Instead, I found myself giving up half-way through. I might pick this up again and finish it, but I stopped caring about the characters. And the previous lip-chewing comment was right. It became a real distraction to me. Too bad, I really wanted to like this."
1,Hitler's Rise to Power,"Hitler rose to power when his book Mein Kampf, meaning My Struggle in English, became popular throughout Europe. He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke. Hungary was bought out during WWII and along with Austria was a big turncoat- Sweden remained a neutral country. I wasn't around during WWII, I don't know what it was like. Transylvania was bought out during WWII."
1,What a waste of money,"When I first new that Gamecube was coming out, I imagined it would be great. I bought it with Luigis Mansion. THE GAME WAS...So then I purchased other games, that were same stupid thing (except for Rogue Squadron and Smash Bros.)Then I started to get information about PS2.So I purchased PS2 and bought Metal Gear Solid 2, AND IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER!! I sold the Gamecube and the games and started trying the PS2 games and almost every game I played was excellent!!. Also, Playstation has 4 new games at the speed tha the gamecube has 1!!.The only good thing Nintendo is doing laslty is the Game Boy Advance.BUY PS2!!"
1,Motorola Li-Ion Extended Battery and Door for Motorola KRZR (Dark Pearl Gray),I ordered this product from OEM. I never recieved the product I ordered. OEM did try and make this right by convincing me to take my review down and sending me out another back to the battery. But they sent me out the exact same back that went to a NEXTEL phone not a KRZR. I still have not recieved the correct back and have no way to use a battery with no back that fits. I have no idea how the battery works or doesn't work. I would NEVER order from OEM and if you do and they screw up your order don't take down your review until you actually have the correct item in hand. In my opinion OEM is a joke.
1,Dont buy this guys,"I brought this item couple of weeks back, i have tried with various mp3 but there is no signal at alllllll"
2,Disclosure,"Must have book... Reveals really interesting information about UFO and what the U.S. government thinks about it, as well as tells us the extent to which the government will go to hide it's secrets. There are a lot of reports that through the book actually prove his point of view. The book makes you wonder what else is the government hiding. By nature i am a very skeptical man, and don't like to believe evverythin i hear however this book really explains the ""paranormal"" thought to us, which is actually really normal. i recommend this book to everyone, it's a great insight into politics and the effect"
2,"Fantastic, inspiring -- an amazaing book!","David Bornstein captures the spirit, determination and passion of social entrepreneurs from all around the globe.I was especially delighted to read about my friend and mentor Bill Drayton, of the Ashoka Foundation. I met Bill in Rio de Janeiro in 1989. During our meeting Bill introduced me to Ashoka, and the stories of the social entrepreneurs they supported. It was my introduction to this wonderful world of committed people.Bill Drayton encouraged me to create my own foundation, and for many years it supported Ashoka Fellows world wide. David Bornstein has encapsulated for me the world of Social Entrepreneurs and their ""Power of New Ideas"" in a vivid and dramatic manner -- more so even than my personal visits to my Ashoka Fellows ever did.This is a powerful read!Joe MillerThe Joseph F Miller Foundationhttp://jfmillerfoundation.org/"
1,jim,"The service was fantastic the cologne is horrible, and I must have close to 50 types, I wasted my money on this one"
2,Great Book of knowledge,"I recommend this book to anyone that wants to know the gossip on how the latest figure skaters got to where they are today. With lots of great pictures of all stars including Michelle Kwan, Sarah Huges, Irina Slutskya, Elvis Stojko, Alexei Yagudin and much much more from all around the world."
1,Where are the Peel Sessions?,I don't understand why they didn't include the 6 extra John Peel Sessions that appeared on the original UK CD.
1,Not funny at ALL!!!!!,I thought Mike was funny. NOT ON THIS ONE! Saw a review and look everywhere for it. When I finally found it on Amazon I was excited for it to arrived. Would like to sell it back!
2,Songs of Peace and Gentle Grattitude,"This is Fr. Peter Bowes' third CD and it is just as beautiful and moving as the first two albums. Fr. Peter's message is a simple one; open your heart to God's Love and to the Light of Jesus and Mary. His style is a gentle, folky accoustic sound with some songs featuring the traditional rock/blues setup of electric and bass guitars, drums and sometimes traditional instruments like flute and cello. One can hear the influences of artists like Bob Dylan, Peter Paul and Mary, Simon and Garfunkel and other great folk musicians of past and present. Of course, Fr. Peter's deepest inspiration goes far beyond any musical artist. His greatest love is for the Divine Composer of this Universe, of this world and of our souls."
1,Nice Try...Move On,"Please don't waste your money. This CD, though an admirable effort by a vocally talented artist, is one of the worst attempts at a breakout album ever recorded. The simple lyrics and dated, electronic sound might pull some weight overseas, but the good ol' U.S. of A. will not embrace mediocre writing spliced with poorly synthesized accompaniment. ""Just close your eyes and count to two/dive on in just me and you""??? Who counts to TWO? Why not ""Just close your eyes and count to three/dive on in just you and me""? And who can overlook the cheesy phone conversation played at the beginning of one of the songs? Come on, Mr. Thomas, we know you can sing. Now prove that you can write."
1,Poor design,The way the cover fits into the bottom of the grill means you have to cover this or it will be full of water every time it rains. We've had this nine months and you constantly have to jiggle the control part to keep the thing from shutting off. I've had other Meco electric grills for the past 25 years and they've been great. This one is not.
2,Slow & creepy,"Being scared of spiders, the grandson was a little hesitant at first in playing with it. But after a few minutes we had it going everywhere, and then it was used to combat a remote controlled truck he had also received for Christmas.The spider doesn't do well on carpeted surfaces and operates fairly slow on a hard surface, and it is limited on going over any obstacles in it's path. But, overall it seemed to be a fun gift for him and everyone remarked how creepy it was."
2,Toronot City Map,"Map was very helpful in a recent trip to Toronto, Canada...Easy to cary in pocket or a backpack and is produced to be durable."
1,not workable,Who can tell me how to open it and insert the battery?I don't think there is a way for doing so. But I hope I am wrong
2,"Good mix of rock, pop, and funk","I bought this CD for my 2 year old daughter who couldn't stop singing ""Sunday Morning."" Well, soon I couldn't stop singing it either. Actually, I like all of the songs on this album, which is not something I can say about every album I own.My most preferred songs are: The Sun, Tangled, Sunday Morning, and Sweetest Goodbye.It is just an easy album to listen to. Not thrashy, full of soul. If you like Maroon 5 from what you hear on the radio, give this CD a go!"
2,excellent knife,This is one of the best pocket knives I have. It is excellent quality. I have several pocket knives and this is one of my favorites. Sog has a lot of good knives. I have had a great experience with Sog knives.
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Fundamentals","I bought an Aiwa product and experienced very poor quality. The stereo cuts out at higher volumes. Also the CD player is already broken after 2 years. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was attracted to the good sound and even better price, it looks like I got what I paid for. Bad product components from inadequate power supply to poor quality of moving parts even worse customer support. There is no reason a piece of electronics should fail after two years."
1,Poorly made (didn't last a week!),I received these as a Christmas present and they didn't even last a week. They came unsewn at the seams around the toe area on both slippers. It is obvious they are very poorly made. I would defintely not recommend these.
1,Ordinary CD instead of SACD,"I'm not sure whose error it is, but I received ordinary audio CD instead of Hybrid Audio CD that I ordered."
2,Overall A very Good Tape but.....,"The episodes that are included on this tape are very good, but I miss the ones like ""Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth"". If that had been on this tape, it would be an easy five star rating. A more enjoyable 2 hours is not likely to be had while viewing any other comedy tape."
1,"Way to go, Hasbro","I bought the game as a Christmas gift, but it didn't work. There was some kind of electronic problem with the display screen. It would display these weird characters instead of words. I exchanged the game for another one and it had the same problem. I returned the game and got my money back. What a piece of junk."
1,Never delivered,"I patiently awaited this CD for over 3 1/2 weeks. When I finally got a inqury from Amazon, I emailed the vendor immediately. He was supposed to refund my money and I still haven't seen it. Bad customer service."
1,total waste of money and time,"Ferenc Mate is the most negative person I ever read. There is a message to his title but the book is nothing but one long, boring bitch session with little or no practical information."
1,Blew a fuse and stopped working immediately,"Maybe it's my car, not this thing, but I don't think it should have blown out the fuse on my Honda Element and stopped working within seconds of having only 2 items plugged into it. So not only did I have to send this thing back, but I also had to take my car in and get the fuse replaced. None of these things seem to work -- the first one I bought died in about 4-5 days. They are all cheap junk made in China. Why doesn't some manufacturer offer a competitive item that isn't junk? I've had a different brand of one of these in my 99 Camry for years and years with heavy use and never an issue. Now that I've gotten the fuse on the Element replaced, I have ordered a different brand and have crossed my fingers. Too bad -- this one had pretty good reviews."
2,Great Book But No More Diets for Me,"I applied some of the principles of this book for a while, but I've really just decided to stop dieting and live as the French do. No more diets, no more fasting. I'm just going to enjoy wonderful whole foods in moderate portions. I highly recommend the following: Chocolat & French Women Don't Get Fat. Bon Appetit, Y'all!!!"
2,Old school.,"A predictably smooth and lush performance from HvK and Berlin, recorded at the twilight of the analog era.Baroque music played on modern instruments is grossly out of style now, but recordings such as this reveal just how lovely this type of music can sound, even if it's not ""authentic"". This is a beautiful performance of these concertos, done in the grand old manner that has almost slipped away with the advent of period performance.Karajan recorded the Brandenburgs in the mid-60's, and again in 1979 (this recording). The 2 recordings don't vary much in terms of performance style, but this set does show just how far analog recorded sound had come by the late 70's, and is an interesting look at another side of a conductor not really known for baroque recordings."
2,"Its Great, But package is a bit "" Beat up""","Looks like it got squashed a little, and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new. But I checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there. I tried one and its great. This is a good buy for what you get. I just got a Damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased. Overhaull 4 stars out of 5 I will buy here again. Fast delivery. Thanks"
2,wonderful for a not-YA reader,"My son was reading this in his 8th grade English AP class and thought I would like it... and boy, did I! I read it in one sitting basically, and completely devoured it.We care about Bella and Edward, we want them to be happy, yet circumstances are at an impasse as to whether they CAN be together.DOn't miss it, totally engrossing even for adults!"
1,worst ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game is impossimble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i can't beat the first level with tahu,you have to make a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong jump!!!!!!!!!"
2,Wonderful Collection,"This is a fantastic collection of McGee's analysis of the Bible. Its much better and cheaper than buying each book separately. I have always loved McGee and have this in hardback along with Kindle and have also listened to him on the radio. There are a few times I have not agreed with him, but right or wrong, I like to read him, and when I can, listen to him. Well worth the money--you will not be sorry."
2,One to Read and Reread,"There are few books I never like to be separated from; this is one. As of this writing, I own it in audio (a constant companion on my iPod), on Kindle, and in paperback. When friends ask for recommendations of spiritual books, this is at the top of my list.All that is surprising, as I generally dislike New Age writing. I find it tends to be smug, preachy, and assertive rather than persuasive. But this book is highly persuasive and highly engaging. Chopra offers compelling frameworks for thinking about issues, but puts full responsibility on the reader; he offers suggestions for integrating his insights into one's life, but avoids the nagging To Do lists that mar the works of people like Dyer.Of course it won't speak to everyone. Nothing can. But do your self a favor and give it a try. It may change your life for the better."
1,Countdown,"We have bought 5 pair of these headphones. They should come with a countdown timer that shows you the product's life expectancy. If you are lucky, they will fail within warranty, otherwise you can be out for close to (or maybe more than) $100 after the one year coverage period. There is no exchange or repair alternatives offered, if they break, try using them for fishing. Problems noted include: volume failure or volume reduction in one or both sides or overall deterioration of the item itself. It would be nice to have this cosmetically appealing domestic product outperform a Chinese derivative that costs less than $25, but this is not the case. Never again from this company."
2,My jeep liftgate is like new again!,"My 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee's liftgate supports were done, they would always drop the lift on my head as I tried to load groceries into it. These were easy to install with the help of a second person."
2,Awesome movie,this is a pretty good movie. Bradley Cooper does an extremley good job at his role. this movie is really good. the actors and the story are awesome. one of the best movies i've seen this year. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
1,Cheaper for a reason,"Dr.Natura is more expensive but MUCH higher quality. This stuff was like stirring sand, never mixed with the water, just sat in the bottom of the cup. I was able to gag one serving down before I threw this crap away."
1,Pink Floyd is terrible !!,"Damn, I wasted my money on this stupid album! I can't understand why Floyd has so many fans! It is usually safe to buy the debut album of a ""supergroup"", but either this assumption doesn't hold good for this band or they're just another mediocre, overrated band."
2,Very pleased with this CD,"If you owned the mid 80's VHS ""Nick Heyward Part 1 Featuring Haircut 100 in MilkFilm"" you will probably enjoy this CD. Like the aforementioned VHS, this CD includes four Haircut 100 Tunes ""Fantastic Day, Favorite Shirt, Nobody's Fool,"" and ""Love Plus One."" You also get several of Nick's most popular solo cuts including ""Take That Situation,"" and ""Blue Hat for a Blue Day."" All of the songs are really great and I am pleased with this CD. If you liked the Haircut 100 album ""Pelican West"" then you will probably enjoy Nick's solo work."
1,Good While it Lasted,"The balls arrived quickly and were just as they were described. However, the orange one began losing air within the first week and had to be refilled almost daily. Unfortunately, it was completely dead within three weeks. The kids are playing kickball on our blacktop playground, so we need balls that will last longer."
2,Rope Pulley,"The pulley did not arrive as pictured -- handles are different. Regardless, it serves it's purpose and has been working out very well. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!"
1,Not pan & scan: Open matted,"... The film was initially shot in the academy ratio (full frame) as a tele-movie. When it's released in theatres it is matted. So the currently-available DVD should be showing the entire frame, not cropped.Still there's no excuse for Artisan's barebone tratement for the title. Not even a trailer is there! We waited so long for it to come out on DVD again and it must be one of the biggest disppointment of the year."
1,Overrated,"Tamora Pierce's popularity is the unfortunate result of the whole Harry Potter phenomenon. Simply because Pierce is a fantasy children's writer, bookstores have been pushing her books. ""If you like Rowling, you'll love Pierce"" is the slogan. I'm a big fan of fantasy books for children, and I eagerly read this book. It completely bored me (plus, what's up with the sex?). The protagonist is annoying and uninteresting. My mind felt like it was rotting as I was reading Pierce's simplistic books. If you want some good children's fantasy books (or good books in general), read Diana Wynne Jones. She's way better than Rowling, and it's complete blasphemy to speak of Pierce in the same breath as DWJ. DWJ has wit, depth, and originality. I would take her books with me on a deserted island since I'm always discovering new things about her stories every time I re-read them. Start off with _Howl's Moving Castle_ (now there's an interesting female protagonist!) and go on from there."
1,not worth it,This book was not worth waiting for. I'm returning it for a refund. I will never read any of her work again.
2,Great Game! Music Rocks!,"I don't know what was wrong with the other two reviewers of this game but I think it rocked. I'm not an avid game player myself but in my opinion the graphics, choices of current snowboarders, tricks and jumps - along with the music, made this game excellent. I'd recommend to anyone!"
2,Inexpensive leather repair,"This product works well when you follow the instructions, but it takes some patience. I accidentally oversanded the area I was repairing, which could have made the leather look worse, but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it. I was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair, and I think this repair won't be noticeable, as the damage is lower on a chair leg. Take the time to mix the color to match the leather, do the repairs in daylight, and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying, and it works pretty well!"
1,WHAT THE *&^*?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I just bought this cd and popped it in my cd player, first song sounded familiar. I continued, next sounded familiar and the next one and the next one, what the hell?! I just got ripped for 13 of my hard earned dollars! im getting my f&%*ing money back. BE WARNED! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!Frukwan your as dead to me as poetic! YEAH I SAID IT!"
1,Christian depravity at it's best,"I endured the painful waste of time to see this film the other night, It was an eye opener to see just how far Christianity has fallen into the ditch that it is in today. Then again the guy who plays God in ""I AM"" also plays in a film made in the same year called""Nude Nuns with big guns""I guess we all can lower our expectation of the Christian god, I know I have, as that god is not the God you will find in the Bible, not by a long shot. There are a few things I can't stand seeing, one is churches that put little reader board signs up that are signed by God. I have even seen them say ""open for business"" And they all cry foul when Cities try to remove the tax exempt status these Business's enjoy. The other is heretical brainwashing trash such as this. They need to have negative stars for movies like these. If you really wish to see how Christianity got this bad you need to see the film ""Constantine's Sword"" you can get it on Amazon."
1,Obvious Question,How can there be class differences between the kids if they live in a nation that's been communist for over 60 years? Wasn't the whole point of La Revolucion to do away with those kinds of distinctions?
2,"Not the best, but very good.","Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are ""Fences"", ""Misery Business"", and ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were ""When It Rains"" and ""Let The Flames Begin."" ""When It Rains"" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And ""Let The Flames Begin"" is basically a crappy version of ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it."
1,Overrated and saggy after short use,"The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you. I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support. This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well.The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags. I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape.Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine. While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros.The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk!"
1,Poor quality clay,The product looks nice and makes a nice present for grandparents. We had a heck of a time getting the clay to roll out evenly. The included rolling pin is a joke. The clay sticks to it so badly we just used our hands. We ordered a different one for ourselves that has a side each for the hand and foot separately. The clay in that set is vastly superior. The difficulty in using the clay would deter me from buying this or recommending it to others. Keep looking. It was really frustrating to use.
2,A definite MUST READ!,"The Three Musketeers series is so aesthetically written. The characters literally take hold of you and pull you back in time with them. There is an amplitude of adventure within each chapter. If you are attracted to sword fighting and galantry, then these books are for you. It would not be very sagacious to avoid reading these novels!"
2,Good product,"Great product. I love what it does for my shoes, and I love it. It is lightweight and works very well for me."
2,Nice phone,"The phone is nice, I like it and does everything I need it to. It does take some getting used to, but after a while it lives up to the communications monster rep it has. Although web-page formating is awkward, it does a good job. I've had it for about 6 months and it's still working like a charm. The only drawback is the size, it's not big, but it ain't small either. Users need to be able to change the keyboard locale to whatever they want.So if you want a nice PDA, it's great. The camera sucks, but the rest of it is great for what you pay for (...)."
2,Standard FJ226,"I put this in my 95 GMC Jimmy on 12/26/2011 . This was a completely brand new unit , unlike most other brands . This corrected a common problem caused by having a faulty fuel pressure regulator . So far after 2 months , I'm very happy with it . My Jimmy has never ran so well during the previous 2 years I've owned it and I have no more sulfur smell coming from the tailpipe .Thanks to Amazon , I received the very best price and FREE shipping ."
2,Guys will enjoy this novel too!,"The characters are marvelous. The plot was interesting. The prose did not measure up to the characters and the plot, hence the rating of a 9. Readers of Joe Gores's novels DEAD SKIP, CONTRACT NULL AND VOID and GONE ! NO FOWARDING ADDRESS and Carl Hiassen's TOURIST TRAP will enjoy this novel as it is written in the same style."
2,couldnt put it down,"i bought this book for a friend of mine in the music indsutry when it came out just because it had interesting musician reviews on the back. i picked it up a few days later and started reading it. i thought it was a great story, very entertaining especially to someone like myself that knows nothing of the inner workings or of the music industry. but once i picked it up i couldnt stop reading it. i even held off giving it to my friend a day so i could finish it."
1,"2.5 stars- A pretty mediocre effort, but still is better than the previous studio album","I haven't owned this cd since about 1988 because it's just not the Foreigner that I came to know and love in the years 1977 to 1981. The only song that I like to listen to repeatedly is the song ""Say You Will"". That song is what Foreigner should sound like. Everything else is boring and mediocre. Unless you're a diehard Foreigner fanatic, you should just pass by INSIDE INFORMATION and just stick with their first four studio albums."
2,"Read, imagine, live","A classic of sociological thought, and one of the best (if not the best) accounts on the purpose and tasks of sociological mindset. Sociological imagination (or perspective, if you will) as intersection of biography and history - pure and simple, yet succinctly incisive and elegantly descriptive. Still a very relevant, influential and timely text for each and all."
2,One Hell of an album,"Buy it! Simple as that. This album is very dynamic... melodic, rockin and punishing."
1,Did this have a point,"As I waded through this book I kept waiting for some sort of revelation. Rhodes skirted around it and never actually allowed the reader to make the leap until the end of the book. I get it: the dog meets a lot of people and somehow touches thier wretched lives. The reader has no idea why and further begins to wonder why they are reading this book.Regarding the ending. Skip it. It is brutal and unnecessary. Ask yourselves, would a spoiled English Brat really brutally murder a dog because he is having some undisclosed crises? No. Rhodes and the reader would have been better served had the dog lived and somehow this weak novel could have been tied together."
2,pretty good way to kill a few hours,"This movie is a sleeper. Not meaning it is a boring flick, but rather that those looking for something to watch could easily overlook it. The characters, an older bureaucrat and female, ex-felon, are sympathetic due to the pain the flies forth from the story of their individuals lives. In the process of going through the motions, these individuals come to find each other. While you will never be sure they are in love with each other or are simply lonely, you get to watch them attempt to create some type of relationship that can become spiritually fulfilling for each person. In the process, you get to witness some intimate moments, as well as some uncomfortable moments. All in all this becomes a really good movie to enjoy."
2,'Allo ' Allo Series one and two,"I'm always on edge when I order a new series but this turned out to be a winner and I can hardly wait to order the rest in the series. My husband and I are both avid fans of British work, especially British humor. This silly series captivated both of us. Hilarious in the least."
1,"Sounds good, but won't last the long-haul...","It sounds good, but no use if it can't stay in the soundhole. I placed my pickup into a portable Yamaha F-1 acoustic.It fit snuggly - fine, great.However, after only about a handful of times taking the pickup out and putting it back into the soundhole, the PLASTIC ""stays""/notched pegs which swivel and brace the soundhole (that is, the plastic pieces which keep the pickup in the soundhole) would not stay taught/fixed.The result - the plastic stays would swivel too easily and collapse the pickup into the soundhole - bummer.I returned it, consequently."
1,Greatly disappointed,"The item is fine, but not the size ordered, and supplier refused to send correct item, as they had no control over their inventory. I ordered 3/4""Brass Floor Flange, 3/4"", but they sent 1"" (labeled as 3/4"") , which they claim they do not have. They did offer a refund, but the cost of return shipping made that unreasonable. With some effort, one can find a different supplier on the internet."
2,On Time and In One Piece,I love this product. I don't know why it's so hard to find in stores. It's easy to create a picture book and the memories are forever.
2,Youth Fantasy Finest for Girls,"First I would like to say, that I love this book mostly because it was the book that introduced me into the world of fantasy. And because what animal-crazed junior high student doesn't want a book about a girl who can talk to animals.Plot: 4/5; Its not extremely complicated but very enjoyable, and not totally predictable.Characters: 4/5; Daine is the wounded soul that every teen thinks they are, and its easy to connect with her as she tries to find her place in the world. I really enjoyed the other characters as well, especially the Riders. They added a lot of fun. (Gotta Love Sarge)Sexuality(5/5=romance w/no sex): 4/5; No romance in this book, though it does develop later in the seriesRecommended Age: Jr. High Students (11ish and up)I do love this book because its a great story about magic and finding yourself. Not to mention lots of animals. Fantastic for animal loving preteen girls"
2,Sheer Pantyhose,"I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose and thigh highs, I have been wearing them for about 15 years. They look and feel good on my legs and under my clothes. They are very sheer and sexy. I can wear them all day and they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles. They are also very durable, I usually get 5 or more wearings out of every pair.I used my Amazon Prime membership for the shipping and received free 2 day shipping. The packages arrived on time and in good shape."
2,Granddaughter loves animals and your magazine,My Granddaughter loves animals and your magazine. This gives her a world view on the animal kingdom. Thank you for the fabulous info.
1,Photo doesn't match item.,The hat didnt match the item. The color was completely different and not a school color.
1,The reception quality is very bad,The reception quality of this phone is very bad. Voice breaks alot even outside building. Other cingular phones work great inside room as well but not this one.
2,"Hugh Masekela ""Sixty""","I have several of Hugh Masekela's albums, and like all of them. However, his CD's tend to be repetitious, with a few new songs on each one. I like ""Sixty"" even though it has an ""old feel,"" because I like his jazz and blues style with it's South African flavor, yet, his music could be surprisingly mainstream for the World genre. He is a mainstay in my African music collection, which is sort of large. This is pretty much easy listening, except for ""Tamati So So,"" which I have on my iPod and use for exercise, which sticks out because of its Caribbean flavor. This isn't my favorite Hugh M. CD, but it's a keeper and definitely a collector's item."
1,Voices are all wrong.,Why couldn't they get the real voice cast to do it? The joker's voice in particular is just awful.
2,An inspiring contribution to metaphysical studies,"In The Vast Enquiring Soul: Explorations Into The Further Reaches Of Consciousness, Ronald Russell argues compellingly for the including of the human soul into everyday thought and conversation, that any scientific concept of the world will remain incomplete unless taking the soul into consideration. Russell evaluated current consciousness research by scientists, philosophers, paranormalists, theologians, poets and historians, and found that consciousness doesn't reside only in the brain, but within the whole body, the earth, and the universe. The Vast Enquiring Soul is an informative, articulate, fascinating, and at times inspiring, contribution to metaphysical studies and the nature of human consciousness."
1,Not A Good Method,This method is not very well organized and is not something a person trying to learn the blues with something that can help them grow along the way. There are a few things of use but not much for the price. The flashy dvd guitar playing is over done and not necessary. People buy this stuff so that they can learn and not something to watch someone else show them how good they are after years of playing. I would not recommend this to anyone but would advise them to look for something with better instruction and not just bits and pieces. Try something with a book/cd like the book by John Ganapes...Blues You Can Use. It is put together as a real teaching method.
2,Willie plays blues with a twinkle in his eye,"This album not only sounds good, it feels good. The mood is one of easy contentment, with the songs sounding well-traveled and the lyrics, while true Blues, having just enough humor for a fun, upbeat listen. The solo guitar and keyboard work, of which there's plenty here to savor, is mature and satisfying. Not one note of it sounded like less than the real Blues thing and I'll be keeping this album and listening to it a lot.I'd really rather give it 4 1/2 stars if I could though, because of the inclusion of Susan Tedeschi, who sounds positively amateurish alternating verses with Willie on ""Crazy."" (Of course, I really don't like her singing, so if you do, discount that last point.) A couple of the other guests could maybe have had a little more than one verse to sing too. But B.B. King's appearances here are good and 4 stars wouldn't have done this CD justice."
1,Not really for non-baseball lovers,"I read reviews that claimed this story was great for those who are not baseball fans. I wish I could agree. I'm not particularly a baseball fan, but wanted to know what all the hype about this book (and movie) was all about. I liked the first few chapters, but then very quickly got bogged down in unfamiliar references and statistics. I hate to not finish a book, and I tried for days to get through to the end, though it started to seem very repetitive mid-way through and my eyes began to gloss over the pages without enthusiasm. Ultimately, I gave up a few chapters short of the end. Just not enough here to keep my interest. I think I'll just watch the movie to find out the end."
1,Zombie-ish,"I was very much looking forward to this release. As big fan starting back with ""Tea for the Tillerman"" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed ""A is for Allah"", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,""An Other Cup"" is unlistenable.Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of ""A is for Allah"" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is."
1,Where's the integrity?,"The NYT digital subscription is like the old roach motel - you can get in but you can't get out.First problem they hit your credit card every 28 days instead of once a month. Sneaky. After a while you have no idea when is the end of the billing cycle (which is when you want to cancel).Second, to cancel you have to call, on a telephone. WHY IS THAT??? Believe me, the wait is long, looong. When (if) they finally answer, the struggle begins.Third, the reps are such liars. Mine said, ""Sir, you are cutting out, I am going to have to hang up..."" and she did. I was calling on a land line! It was infuriating. What am I to think of that company's reporting truth if they have such little regard for it while talking to a person?The 99 record clubs of my teenage years had more integrity than the NYT!"
1,Lacie's are BAD NEWS,I had a 500Gig crash on me within a year. I bought this 250 as a replacement. Out of the box it was unfunctional and made the weirdest sounds I've ever heard. I sent it to Lacie and they sent it back to me no different. I'm not using Lacie anymore - too much is at stake. I loved the way they looked and stacked but I'm WAY OVER it. Lacie no more.
2,"Spiritual, forward-thinking hardcore","If you're a fan of militant, spiritual hardcore then you'll like this record. There is a heavy Islamic influence in the lyrics and message and a thick, driving tone in the music. There are only 3 songs for a total of five-and-a-half minutes of music so if you can find it cheaper somewhere else then you might want to think about that. La ilaha il'Allah!"
1,Cute little item.,"Be careful about your purchase. The one we acquired was a miniture version. The type was ok and you could read it, but the book was about 2"" x 3"". It was a miniture and not at all what we thought we were acquiring. We wanted the whole book. When ordering we did not notice that it was a miniture edition."
1,Poor Fit,"Sorry i had to review this... I got this 5 years ago and i've been using it to work ever since. The first thing i noticed was the straps were to short to snap at the back of the chair so because of it, it does not rest well and ends up sitting on the side. I have to constantly move it in the middle because the way the straps were made makes the backrest move to the side. This will only work for small chairs not the one's you see at work. I have yet to find a good one but for now i'll just add a pillow"
2,This bar is excellent! It's like eating a ...,This bar is excellent! It's like eating a peanut butter brownie with chocolate frosting -- and it helps you lose weight. I've tried other bars and drinks and they didn't have the good taste that this one does. I would highly recommend it!
1,Horrible,Not even worth watching for free. Terrible. Horrible. Very Bad. Should never have been made. Waste of time. Crap. Trash. Couldn't even finish it.
1,Waste of a tree,"This book is nothing more than a compilation of other tests gathered from other sources with no regard to the actual exam. Some of the questions are wrong, misspelled or just plain outdated. The guide given by CBP is much more useful....and free. None of the exams are of the same style of the actual test and the mathematics portion does not concentrate on the areas needed."
1,Constant problems.,"My wife and I both bought Polar FT60 heart rate monitors in 2009. We like the FT60 watch unit, but the Wearlink transmitters have caused us so many problems that we went back to using the T31 transmitters from our old Polar heart rate monitors. I've replaced the batteries several times and even after that I have constant problems receiving the heart rate. The T31 transmitters are much more reliable and we finally threw away our Wearlinks. If you need a replacement transmitter, I highly recommend buying the older style T31 tranmitter."
2,A high quality movie with lots of added stuff,"Movie and sound quality was great, quite frankly with all the added storyboard and interview information added they could have just added T1 and it would've been fine for the price"
1,One of the very worst of the series,"Neither scary nor fun. What a waste of my time. This is a pretty darn pitiful entry into the series. Probably one of the main reasons that Showtime did not pick it up for a third season. If you rent this, make sure it's cheap."
2,Borchardt knows the job market,"Obviously, the job market isn't what it once was, but even when the economy recovers, the days of getting hired out of college and being set for life are gone. And yet, people still cling to that idea. John Borchardt had great insight on the field, and he was very helpful when a scientist in my family was unemployed."
1,Broke on 12 th hole,I was making mortises in red oak and the bit broke on the 12th hole. I am not happy with the quality of the bit. Everything else I have that is Delta has has shown itself to be of good quality.
1,Don't waste your money,"Two of these were purchased for my kids to use during a long car trip. They had a great picture, decent sound and were easy for a 5 year old to use. However, before the end of the first movie, both devices stopped working. They would freeze and fail to load any other discs until you took out the disc in it, turned it off and unplugged it. Needless to say, I am quite disappointed with these devices, especially due to the frustration that it caused with my two young children during the trip. Do yourself a favor and buy a better known brand. This product is to good to be true."
1,Anita Blake series is dead...,"If you have any desire for the old Anita Blake, vampire hunter, detective, and animator, then do not get this book. In all of the previous books, there was at least a thread of the detective in the book.The percentage of the books dedicated to the old Anita Blake has steadily declined since Obsidian Butterfly. This book is 5% sex with a new guy, 5% sex with a stranger, 5% do I have a new power or not, and 85% sex with everyone else.After the last book, I commited myself to stop buying this series if the next book did not contain any of the old Anita. I will re-read the books up to Obsidian Butterfly if I need an Anita Blake fix and re-read everything after that if I need an Anita Blake gets sex fix.My only consolation is that I have spent more money on the good Anita Blake books than the bad. This author is now assigned to the list of authors I look for when at a library.:("
1,didn't like the attitude,"I didn't watch the whole thing. In the table manners section I didn't like the suggested attitude - feeling superior to those who lack manners, looking for mistakes other might make and discussing them very negatively. Even though it's done for the sake of learning, I wouldn't want my children to adopt this attitude. This by itself is not good manners."
2,Lady Killer!!!!,"Gentlemen!!! my review title says it all, I had tested this beauty in a shopping mall last month...n finally got it yesterday..guyz u got to believe me, this is one of d best EDT's out there..sure a lady killer..get urs soon..here in India this is available for 1200RS(24 USD)"
2,Wonderful Movie for the entire family,My entire family enjoyed this movie. SO nice to sit and watch a movie with my children and not hear foul language or see any suggestive material.
2,Bill Peet always brings a positive outcome to a difficult situation.,Bill Peet always brings a positive outcome to a difficult situation! The little caboose found a happy ending out in the forest he loved. Thank you
1,plantstand,"Adorable table, great price but marble top was split from one corner to the other. Terms for replacement too much for the price I paid."
2,Great for Dogs,"Great as a supplement for my dogs. This has helped to aid their hair growth after a long and grueling fight with fleas. They went from having barely any hair in certain places. To now having overgrown hair. But I don't mind they can always be groomed. Also if your afraid of your animal not liking it don't worry. One of my dogs has become very aware that I add things to her food including vitamins and flea medication. So she will simply scoop out the food with her mouth and examine what she is eating before chewing and swallowing it. Even though she look at it she always eats it. I think they like the oil inside. Either way i'm happy. Give this to your dog for sure, for hair growth and over all wellness. They'll thank you with their health and happiness."
1,Do not buy!,"Vidal Sasson VS184C Gold Series Professional Three-Barrel WaverThis product is a waste of money, it overheats and smokes and burns out your hair. This product is a household hazard and do not recommend this to anyone!"
2,Sepultura Heavy tribal Metal Mayhem and Mike Patton Too,"Seputura plays heavy, heavy sounds from South America I think, the lyrics are in english but the groove is not your typical American Rock, its a ""tribal Assault"" and ""Roots"" is definatly unique. Max Calvera (Soulfly) is at his Best on these tracks and You also get a taste of Mike Patton's amazing Vocals for a brief moment. Not long enough if you ask me but a nice addition to a otherwise strong album. Check it out!"
1,Too small for my iron,"This is a great product if your iron fits in the casing! As it is, I am only using this product to hang my board."
1,Would not purchase this if you want good sound quality,Poor sound quality - no adjustments for treble or bass - sounds cheap and tinny. Returned this product for refund.
1,Wanted to love it but...,"This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me."
1,YUCK! DONT READ IT ITS HORRIBLE,this book was soo boring i stopped reading it because the book took forever to get somewhere. WASTE OF TIME!
1,Good . . . until it dies,"No real complaints about the sound or distorted bass. The fit was also quite comfortable and with a somewhat extended commute, that's definitely something I appreciate. What I don't appreciate though is that after about 3 months, sound stops coming out of the left earbud because of the thin wiring and inadequate protection. I replaced one set of these and three months later, the exact same problem has arisen."
2,All about flowers,"A well written, info packed introduction to flowers. Nice detail about the plant life cycle. For example, ""a circle of stamens grows around the stigma. Each stamen holds a pollen sac called an anther."" The photos are clear and labeled and the book design is very colorful. There is one activity (food color/water/carnations). One page shows examples of flowering and non-flowering plants. There is a glossary and index. Karen Woodworth Roman, MS, Children's Science Book Review"
1,Don't buy,I purchased on Amazon and it was used buy my 3 kids over the age of 10 for about 30 minutes before the chain became separated from the claw. Impossible to fix with out unscrewing many screws and taking it completely apart. So it was packed back up and sent back to Amazon. NOT WELL MADE at all. Don't waste your time like we did. Just a junk toy.
1,Waste of money,"While the printer itself may be relatively cheap, you'll spend so much money on ink that in the long run you'd be better off getting a good laser printer. It seems to run out of ink after only 15-20 pages."
2,My little 4lb man loves dragging this around!,My Maltese likes cloth toys that he can play tug with and drag around. He loves this and after more than a year it still looks new!
2,Loved it...in Japanese!,"I loved it totally, but hated the English adaptation and wished it could be re-released. At least this is the full-version one now instead of the cut one. What I loved the most was the theme song because I love Minmay/Mari Iijima. I've watched this in English and Japanese... I DEFINITELY LOVE THE JAPANESE ORIGINAL WAY, WAY BETTER!!!"
2,gory and thrilling,"I am unashamedly a fan of Simon Clark. Blood Crazy is fun, frightening, heartrending, gory, and always entertaining. Did I mention gory? I hate gore. But Simon Clark's books are so entertaining that I just close my eyes and skip right past those parts that are too hard for me to read. If you enjoy zombie/PA/disaster tales, you will enjoy this book."
2,Excellent,"Alarm Clock continues with the ideas on Richie Haven'sMixed Bag: take good popular songs, and apply Richie's vocals and madman strumming.This is a little more guitar geared than Bag, and is not the tight folk-pop masterpiece that album is , but it is still a great album.Absurdly, Havens' albums from this era are hard to get or out of print, only available on pricey imports. More absurdly, people now think of him as ""the guy who opened Woodstock.""But back in their time, these were important for kids into folk rock, expecially African American one's who connected to the genre through Richie, and were regulars if not staples on early FM radio.There is no good reason all his albums from 1967-72 should not be in print."
2,CUTE,"When I listen to this album, the word ""cute"" comes to my mind. I am a huge Hilary fan, and absolutely love her music. This CD, however, was recorded over two years ago. When comparing Santa Claus Lane to her latest release, the difference is astounding. Now she has a much stronger, deeper, and more talented voice. I still listen to this CD for Christmas, because even with her voice being high pitched and more digitallized, she still is far more tollerable than the whiny groan of Celine Dion. I would buy this CD for the 8 - 15 age group. If you are looking for Hilary's developed, natural vocal talent, go for the self-titled ""Hilary Duff"" instead."
2,Small size with lots of info,I had this same book for when I lived in NM. Now here in the NW (ID) I got this one. I am a biologist and find this book very helpful in the field.
2,Well worth seeing,This was a good selection as a date night movie. Powerful acting from an all amateur cast which helped to make for a completely authentic and credible story line. Shame on us if people are still living like this anywhere in the US or on the fringes of the Mississippi.
1,Disappointed.,Was expecting a lot from this product because its black and decker. Used it for a few months and the suction is almost non-existent. The on and off switch was not made properly because it looses some suction through there.
1,This movie is heartless and it is terrible,The movie is gross obnoxious and far from funny!I feel sorry for the mother having to put up with that demon child who blames her terrible behavior on her imaginary friend. If Fred is supposed to be helping her how is him wreaking havoc helping her or anyone for that matter. If I was the mother found dog poo on my carpet I'd have that brat sent military school. As for Fred he needs to be sent to the blackest void in space!
2,Grand Trunk,"So far I have been quite happy with the product. I'm not certain how it will hold up, and I have read mixed reviews. This didn't deter me from purchasing. I also couldn't be happier with Amazon's customer service. The first shipment disappeared so they overnighted a second one. For that I'm greatful."
1,still the same,"cant tell any difference. took it for a month and still feel the same as i did before. i also take other pills so i dont want to stop taking all of them, to find out. i eat very healthy food so maybe that is all i need."
2,Great product,This is a great product. It is very easly to use and has a great scent. After use my face did look and feel refresh and tight. I would recommend to anyone who has tired dull skin to give this a try.
2,Laugh Out Loud,"I read this book to my two children, and it made all three of us laugh out loud! There aren't many books which our whole family can enjoy, but this was one of them. There was something of value and humor for each of us, although we are very different ages. I recommend other familes enjoy this title."
1,An Overblown New Yorker Article,"Although the title looked enticing, I was greatly disappointed as I read this slim volume. I was vaguely told what ""Nobrow"" was, but no whys, no wherefores. Was it a celebration of Nobrow or a critique? The book contains profiles of what the author sees as noted Nobrow figures, like David Geffen and George Lucas. They seemed to be re-edited New Yorker articles, and are nice as they go, but after 200 or so pages, I still don't have much of a clue as to what Nobrow really is. I did, however, learn who the author was. He seems to be the sub-text of this book. We know he is a feature writer at the New Yorker, a Princeton grad, and lives somewhere in Tribeca. If you want to read a book about today's culture and its roots, read Thomas Franks' The Conquest of Cool. If you want to read a book about the New Yorker, try Bright Lights, Big City. At least it's more honest."
1,Horrible waste of time,This book by far was very disappointing. Three quarters the way through it gave u a dictionary.....What the heck.......then that was it...it ended like that!!! By far very disappointing read.
1,"Will not seat to toilet tank, and leaks around valve.","Model includes two different gasket for the large nut connection to the toilet tank. Neither one provided a tight seal. With either, moving the hose slightly causes leaks around the gasket. Do not purchase this product.Update: They gave us a free replacement, but we just tried installing it, and it leaks around the factory installed joints around the valve. An excellent product if you want slow, accumulated water damage to your home."
2,The Brandenbergs from the other side...,"Jordi Savall is one of a very small group of exceptional viola da gamba players and conductors. What makes this rendition of the Brandenburgs as pleasing as it is is the clarity of the inner voices. I attribute this to Savall's Medieval and Renaissance roots. Most of the existing recordings of these gorgeous pieces are conducted by persons whose experience and expertise is Baroque or later. Savall's sensitivity to what came before and led up to J.S. Bach is, IMHO, the reason that these recordings are as splendid as they are. I am an avid follower of Savall and recommend his recordings almost without exception. This one is at the top of my list of Brandenburgs."
1,"Beware, this is the Special Edition","That other guy doesn't know what he is talking about. This is not the REAL Star Wars. I mistakenly purchased these videos and found out that they have all the horrible added scenes and Lucas ""special touches"". Do not buy this if you are looking for the untouched version of Star Wars!"
1,Unfortunate,"I was hoping that Darren Hayes debut solo album would have some artistic merit, but unfortunately I was wrong. The entire album was charted out like any other bubble gum artist. Don't get me wrong Savage Garden were pop but they also wrote and played the instruments (or the better half did anyway), and its obvious to anyone that listens that Daniel Jones was the talent and Darren was merely a interpretive singer. That being said there are a couple enjoyable songs ""Good Enough"" being the only one that strives for a definitive sound that isn't already to cliched.Darren shame on you for selling out and doing anything the execs wanted in order to sell albums, where is your pride in this contrived mess of bubblegum? I'm hoping maybe it will grow on me....."
2,"Works great, a bit noisy","We have a Coleman air mattress (the 4-in-1 air bed) that we only use in our home (as opposed to camping). Consequently, getting an electric pump seemed like an obvious choice. The coleman 120V Quick pump works great and is designed to work with Coleman products. You blow up the bed, then when it's fully inflated, push in to lock and then manually seal the bed. It works perfectly and easily as described and is a great purchase. The only caveat is that it is a bit noisy, so if you have close neighbors or sleeping kids, aim to blow up the bed earlier rather than later in the evening."
2,Great,Very good for its price and it is the suitable case for protection and has lot of spaces for many things
1,Not what I was expecting,"I have to start by saying I am not an avid Anne Rice reader, with that in mind I bought this series of books based on a friends recommendation. We are almost no longer friends over this series. The book is literally nothing but continuous rape and subjugation. I forced myself to finish the book on the hope that it would improve but at no time did I ever see a plot. The book started with the raping of beauty to wake her, then the prince took possession of her and used her as his play thing through the whole book. It really is disgusting, and now I have two other books in the series that I refuse to read. My stomach just can't take that amount of crudity and cruelty.On a personal note, if you somehow have found joy or interest in this book there is really something wrong with you. The girl is 16 being raped day in and day out. I'm shocked a publisher even took a chance on this series...."
2,Looking to expand my my taste in metal,"Less melodic than I am used to but the band is incredibly skilled. not exactly my style, but I recognize the skill."
2,Carhartt Jeans,"These jeans fit very well for me. They seem to be very well constructed.I will buy them again. Good price, quick shipping."
2,Indescribable!!!,"My cousin gave me the first two books in this series. For some reason i read Charlotte first. It was so great, i couldn't imagine how Katherine could be better. But it turns out i couldn't put Katherine down. It's got to be the best book i've ever read! So if you enjoy history, romance, and adventure, then Katherine is THE book to read! So what are you waiting for? Pick up the book and READ IT!!! Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"
2,Owned it for several months.,"I've owned it for several months. Although it is made in China, so far so good. I did buy an extended warranty from SquareTrade though because I don't want to pay for shipping even during the standard warranty period.It occupies a lot of space, but it think it is worth it. Of course it is not suitable for a small room such as an office or a bedroom, unless such a room is more than 12' x 12'.I am not a connoisseur of subwoofers, but it seems to me that this one produces somewhat softer sound which is good for movies but perhaps will not excite you if are buying it primarily for heavy metal, but of course, it is a subjective perception."
2,Over your ear and Away You Go,"My original headset had a thin plastic loop that slipped over the ear. It broke and couldn't find a part. This design has you loop over the ear, decide on ear bud size, select earbud a size smaller so that it can nest in tight and away you go.While it's cumbersome to get in place over your ear (especially with glasses) I love how it's snug allowing me to hear well and stays that way."
2,Better than ever,"After re-viewing this show, I truly beleive Twin Peaks was a timelss television experience. It resonates as one of the most creative, touching, frightening, and funny experiences ever created in the medium. The second season is at least as effective as the first for those willing to invest."
1,Worst Phone I Have Ever Used,"I have had this phone for over a month now. For some reason, when you press a number button ""0-9"", it does not always register with the phone. The phone beeps, but if you listen into the handset, it never transmits the tone over the phone line. So when a phone number has a ""2"" in it for example, you have to press the ""2"" button one to five times before it will actually register. This also affects memory dial and causes that feature to be completely useless."
2,Zelda takes an encore,"Zelda is back, and it's hard to believe that something this good could fit on the GameBoy Color!! With new weapons like the Seed Satchel, Switchhook, and a now upgraded Roc's Feather which lets you jump over 3 holes if you play it right, this game has won my heart and is a definite buy for any Zelda fan. Iv'e played the first dungeon before, and already I was astounded at the great graphics, coll bad-guys, and the sweet boss. If you like Mega Man and Zelda, hang on, because Capcom AND Nintendo both made this masterpiece!!"
2,historical novel with memorable female character,"Like most of Lee Smith's novels, this is excellent. It reminded me of ""Jane Eyre"", the classic British novel about an orphan girl who faces tremendous challenges in her life. It may also remind you of ""Gone with the Wind"", with the post-Civil War setting (except that the Ku Klux Klan in this story have no redeeming qualities at all- which is more accurate), and the amount of suffering experienced by the heroine. The first part of the story, Molly Petree's childhood, is really the best- it is haunting. The rest of it is nearly as good. At one point Molly writes ""I gave it my whole heart. I would do it again."" That also describes how I feel about this book. Smith clearly did a great job with her research to make this story feel so real."
2,Rock on,"This band can knock it out of the park. Hard driving guitar licks that are a nice change from the technotronic music of the 80's. Get this one, it rocks."
2,100% perfect.,"Both disc were delivered in good time and perfect condition, just what I was asking for. I recommend this product to anyone who like this type of music."
1,Frenchies : Forget about it !,One more Canadian dub.... Never buy that one for the french version. The same for the Zone 2 version !
1,They have done way better,"It's very....blinkish. It's just not that good of a CD. There's no intensity at all, and that's a key element of punk music. I love Millencolin, don't get me wrong. But, it's what is in there other CDs that I love. I just hope this was an experimental CD and they aren't following the path of the Vandals who are going down hill. The Vandals last two CDs were so slow and not anything like ""Live Fast Diarrhea"" or ""the quickening"". These new sounds of punk bands are soundling like Blink 182, and Blink is just another boy band. And Blink, I can't stand at all"
1,a waste of money,"I was really looking forward to getting this egg timer but it's a disappointment. Eggs were supposed to be hard-boiled, but they were decidedly medium - a big mess. I'm not sure I'll use this thing again."
1,Warning,This product works in with Windows XP ONLY! Do not buy if you have Windows Vista or Window 7!!!!!!! The setup for Windows XP is very particular to SP2. I updated my Windows XP SP2 to SP 3 and the junk software that comes with this thing quit working!! Don't but this thing!!!!!
2,Thornetta Davis,The CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thornetta Davis' music should be a part of every blues lover's collection!
1,Armageddon on the High Seas!,"Octopus can easily be used as an educational tool. Some of the things I learned are: 1. Fat can help protect you from explosions. 2. Berlin, Germany, 1952, happening place to be. 3. Unrestrained beakers do not break in submarine crashes. 4. You can't swim with a skirt. 5. Corrosion does not occur to metal barrels at the bottom of the sea.I was just looking for a good movie for a Sunday night, but it is terrible..."
2,Love it and use it for every run!,"First off, the price. Yellow was about half the price of the other colors. I didn't mind. The numbers are large and it has a great backlight for early in the morning when it's still dark. I even use the timer for when I proctor the ACT/SAT exams on weekends. It will store up to 100 runs. It has only five, easy to figure out buttons. The one that counts (splits, laps...) is on the face and larger than the others. The band is velcro and stays put on my skinny wrist. I can't think of a single negative except I don't think I'll be able to change the battery myself when and if the time comes. For the price, I should have bought two..."
2,Wonderful read,"This is an excellent book. It tells a terrific story that will capture and hold your attention. At the same time, amazingly, you'll learn some really interesting history and architecture while Follett's rich rendering of the time and customs will allow you to ""experience"" the book, if you know what I mean. You'll feel a part of it, rather than a witness. Enjoy."
1,Rechargable battery does not work,"At first i thought it was a good bargain, but this player does not have good quality even for the price, slow control response and poor documentation, my real problem with this player is that the rechargeable battery never worked when i connect the usb cable to charg the battery it starts to connect and disconnect and never charges the battery, so this for me like a disposable player, i hate to say this because i already bought it, but my advice dont buy this poor qualiy player"
2,Great !,The game contidition is great and it was recieved earlier than expected which is awesome. This is not the first game i've ordered here and certainly won't be the last!
2,Lorax,"Kids loved it, and the adults as well, we all were capitvated with the movie will watch it again enjoy"
1,Bad idea,My daughter loves having these in the tub. BUT the only thing she does with them is try to drink out of them. The water also rarely turns the wheel unless poured directly on it. If you don't mind your kids drinking the bath water they will love these. If you do I suggest finding something else.
1,Don't waste your money,"You won't get a lot of useful info out of this book. There is a limited listing of cocktails, and two chapters on bar jokes and practical jokes. One tenth of the book is a glossary telling us such valuable things as 'jack' refers to jack daniels and a five dollar is a 'five spot'. Another chapter deals with landing a bartending job with sub-headings such as The Want-Ads and Friends and Relatives. The quality of the writing is what you might expect from the content.I mean, really,.... :^p"
1,Mowat Cried Wolf,"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under ""Comedy"" if not ""Fiction"". Putting it under an ""Ecological Essay"" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing ""ecological"" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies."
2,A Good Analysis,"This book offers a thought provoking look at Europe and how its being overtaken by radical islam, loosing its prosperity, its heritage, and becoming a violent dangerous place with a visceral hatred of America.Why is this happening? Europe has failed to learn from the past.Europeans have devalued life and stopped believing in themselves and their culture as unique and deserving to be preserved.This book is important because as the title implies what happens to them will effect us as well."
2,Very Easy to Use,"We had not registred for this but a friend who saw that we were registered for an ""infant"" car seat (that pops in/out of base for carrying) said that this was a must have. In terms of portability - it is very light and very manuverable (can steer with one hand). Once assembled - it is very easy to set up and get the baby in/out quickly. Makes trips to the store easy. We returned our other stroller once we received this as a gift. We will be sad to see it go when our son grows out of his infant car seat."
1,What a horrible book!!!,"This subject had such promise! Unfortunately the author turned it into a Harlequin Romance bodice ripper novel about exploited, misunderstood white women who could only find understanding by ""volunteering"" to become the wives of a Native American chief who was hoping to broker a cross cultural understanding by ""marrying"" his family to white women.He perpetuates every stereotype of native americans and the sexual motives of women that have come down through time. Shame on you!! This could have been a fantastic historical novel. I am sorely disappointed!! You have done a disservice to everyone involved."
1,SLOW!!!!,"This coffee pot has a good design & I really want it to work, but it takes FOREVER. 45 - 1 hour to completely brew a pot of coffee. They seem to have forgotten the most important feature of a coffee pot. And the clock is a dumb design too.Buy something else."
2,Great carseat,"I love this car seat. We own a 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan (with stow and go), and a 2008 Dodge Ram truck, and it fits great in both. I love how it is not overly bulky - a HUGE plus. There are spots on the back to store everything, and this works well. I do not like how unnecessarily long the tether is. But that is my only complaint. We also own a Britax, and I like the Radian more, again mainly because of it not being bulky. My DS, who is 2, loves it. It is comfortable for him, and that is a big thing - he is 2 and 40 lbs. Anyone with bigger kids, I highly recommend this seat!"
1,Pathetic,"Really disappointed over all in the NationalGeographic toys. This one also failed miserably in performance. This was purchased for a 6 year old for Christmas. As another review stated you can't keep it in alignment or focus even as an adult. The 6 year old was NEVER able to focus in even on a big bright star.He got very frustrated from trying and even started to cry. You can see more with our pair of binoculars. Save your money and go for a higher power and better frame, ect."
1,Worthless,"I've had two sets of Memorex DVD-R discs and no matter what they last a year at best, burned or not. Save yourself alot of headaches and spend an extra $5 dollars on another brand that actually works."
2,Kids love it,"My kids love to watch this DVD. It is a treat for them, and it is entertaining to watch."
2,Very Soothing,"I love this CD. It's great to sleep to, to aid in meditation, and especially to help me calm down when I'm upset. This is my first pregnancy, and I need all the help I can get staying relaxed and worry-free. I especially love the affirmations!"
2,Works great!,"This is an exceptional hair gel. It holds well without being gummy or sticky, and easily washes out leaving no residue."
1,Not Funny,"""Uses for a Dead Cat is NOT funny and promotes cruelty to cats. If you buy this or think its funny you need your 'head examined'.c"
1,Not Quite Worth It,"This is basically an hour long ""documentary"" about the band's first 2 years on a major label. By documentary, I mean that it's essentially an extended version of the type of on-the-road, backstage footage you would expect to be included as a Bonus DVD with an album. It's interesting enough to watch once, but really unless you're a hardcore fan this is probably just something to borrow from someone else and watch once."
2,Well Made and Good Message,I just watched Sarah's Choice on 1/11/10. It is well made and has quality actors. The storyline is based on a single career woman named Sarah who becomes pregnant unexpectant. She faces a decision of what to do with the child and the direction of her life. I have TV Guardian and it even did not have anything to cut out. This would be a good family film and is pro-life. God reveals Himself to her in a series of three dreams before she makes her decision about the child and her future. Great story on God's forgiveness and human forgiveness!
1,Instructions: DO NOT BAKE COOKIES!,"I put this on my Christmas wishlist because I wanted to make bread, pizza, and cookies. My stone arrived in one piece packaged really well. A box within a box stuffed with packing peanuts within a box filled with dense paper. Upon reading instructions, you cannot bake items with a high fat content such as cookies."
2,Great replacement belt!,"This belt replaces one that was damaged when a zinc pot-metal motor sheave split and chewed it up in less than a minute of operation. With a new cast-iron sheave installed, this belt should last a long time."
1,Makes my dogs sick,"I thought this product would help my dog with digestion problems. She has a sensitive stomach and has previously benefited from enzymes and probiotics. Instead it made my dog cough and vomit. Even my other dog, who is less sensitive, vomited from this product. I do not know how to get a refund, but I wish I could."
1,"Okay, but a bit over the top","It's a good book with a strong point, but the message grows tiresome. Practically everything is a potential security weakness to this guy. If you lock the doors, he warns about the windows. If you encase your house in concrete, I'm sure he could find some concrete eating bacterium from the jungle. It grows a bit tiresome.I'm a bit surprised that he's actually in the security business. How can he hold such views and actually make recommendations to clients? Does he say, ""Gosh this solution is terribly dangerous, but it's not as dangerous as the other solutions?""Plus, he's obviously a bit out of touch. He says that steganography can't work because no one ever sends him a picture. Heck, I get pictures from my family members all of the time. What's wrong with him?It's not a bad book, but it's a bit too much."
2,great stuff,Great product at a great price. Can use this protein powder with just water or mix with juice or make a fruit smoothie. I used it for a 10 day fast and lost 12 pounds. Will definitely purchase this product again from this seller!
2,Great product at a great price!,"I bought 2 sets of these hubcaps to put on my 15"" winter tires/steel wheels. These snapped on snug and have not come off in the few weeks that I have been using them so far. I wanted something that had a similar look to the stock Chevy Cobalt wheels and these fit the bill."
2,Amazing,I thought this book was incredible. It was full of twists and turns and had great suspense. I read it a few years ago and still recommend it to people looking for a great book to curl up with ... just don't read it in the dark. : )
2,You won't be able to put this one down....,"If you have any interest at all in forensic investigations, like to watch CSI, Foresnsic Files, Cold Case Files or Law and Order, this book is a MUST BUY. I literally could not put it down until I was finished! Easy read, ten case files that will have you riveted page after page. Ends with blunders in investigations."
2,Good Pocket Performer,Bought two peds...one for me and one for spouse. Easy to set up and use. Place in pocket in any position and it seems to record steps without difficulty. So far so good.
1,not water assistance,"in frist time when I washed my hand the water entered the glass . then I contacted the amazon customer service . I returned and they sent me another watch , but same problem . the water became inside the watch , and now it doesn't work at all .I will not returned and I will not buy it any more ."
1,LOL,"LOL, you have the group confused with someone else. ABC was never a boy band, silly. The music on this CD is their greatest hits compilation and it is very much a reflection of what they did while they were together. The guy on the cover is the singer and no one tried to pull anything on you, you simply ordered a CD by the wrong band. LOL"
1,"SLOWEST shipping, NO communication, OK product.","Two weeks after purchase, no product or any email received even though Amazon said ship in 1-2 business day, and no reply to email query. Then I complained to Amazon and waited another week to get the product.The product is ok for use on body front where I can reach. Though most useful treatment should be on the back where I could not reach and the sucking device does not provide a soft tube to make it possible unless get help from second person.By the way, I tried to buy this product from same seller on Ebay and was over-bidded by some bidders, but then I was told they don't want to buy and I can buy it with the MAXIMUM price I set. It feels like manipulation. Either seller or Ebay was not reasonable."
2,It's All That,"Mainly just want to give this 5 stars. Before I bought the CD back in the 90s, I already knew I liked The Cure, but this CD elevated them in my mind. I became protective of the CD and didn't really play it around other people or any of that because, you know what happens when people want to ""borrow"" a CD. Anyway, I eventually let a relative borrow it once and, of course, it's gone. That thing was still completely playable after all that time... Well, here I am now looking to get a replacement. But yeah, the CD is more than just a mix, it's like a reworking and to be perfectly clear, the songs are just plain better on this CD than the prior versions (IMNSHO). Worth every penny and then some."
1,BEWARE OF THE POT HOLES OF BACKROAD,"A confusing chronological order and unrevealing flashbacks mar this Indie thriller. An overusage of pointless panoramic vistas doesn't help either. None of the characters are likeable, especially the psychotic Jasper and Joseph, the mysterious stranger. The finale is senseless and does little to bring resolution. BACKROAD is obviously intended to be a parable on good vs. evil, but ends up a disjointed example of style over substance---and the acting is pretty bad!"
2,works well; good value,This cam is fine for the price; you get clear pictures; fairly easy to clip to a notebook.
2,Kind of Lengthy but Good,A long and meaty film that satisfies. Hard to believe it really happened. Highly recommended for an evening's entertainment.
2,"works great, just kinda large","The software is easy to use, will help even a novice set up a sprinkler system to get the most use of your water. It's nice to be able to ajust for varying conditions without reprogramming. Two drawbacks: It's black and bulky. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but I've had my old timer on the wall on my back porch for years, this one will have to find a new location. The other problem is the way the USB programming module plugs in, I think it's going to be require a large outdoor enclosure, in order to be able to plug it in."
1,Worked but....,"I am a woman that RV's a lot and had trouble getting a good grip on my cord and pulling it off the electrical box. So I thought this was going to be the best solution. I cut the plug off my electrical cord, and easily installed this one. Works great but....now with the handle attached, the plug won't fit out the electrical cord exit hole on my coach. So I have to leave the access door open, and get rain and snow inside the electrical compartment, which is ruining the lining inside. I should of bought an adapter with a handle on it..."
2,Rancid comes back and rocks the world.,"Rancid's new album Life Won't Wait is full of great new songs. They have one of the best punk sounds today and this album is the perfect example. Songs such as ""bloodclot"" and ""new dress"" are getting heavy airplay. Every song on the album rocks and you won't be disapointed. And of course you gota love the mohawks."
2,Great Product!!!,"My 6yo daughter wanted a fountain for her birthday party. I researched different products and found this one was the best for the money. I used simi-sweet chocolate chips and it worked perfectly. The kids dipped marshmellows, strawberries, bananas, pretzels and animal cookies. The adults found this a hit more then the kids did. The set up and clean up was eazy, the motor is not noisy and the flow of the chocolate worked the way it was supposed to once I got it leveled. I am so glad I bought this product."
1,*sigh*,"Well, I have to say that I am saddened by this album. GC is relying way to much on the way people lable each other to market their music. I've seen way to many ""punk"" , ""preppies"" and ""posers"" in these reviews. When GC first came out, they were normal people. Yes, Benji had his tatoos and such, but nothing was nearly as milked as it is now. Now, bands like NFG and GC rely to much on the whole ""punk"" look and ""lifestyle""(no pun intended). No one seems to see that the music that they all play isn't ""punk"", it's just ""rock n roll"". Power chords and a nice drumbeat with a little acoustic ballad or so. And if you like it, more power to you, but I see it as way to generic. If you like music that is catchy and kind of repetative, with some meaningful lyrics, then go for it. If you want something with a little more originality and some very thought provoking lyrics, then go for Radiohead - The Bends, or At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command. And Green Day is always good."
1,"This Book Should Be Titled, ""Dude, I Hate My Country""","You know, I tried to read this blatently liberal biased book with an open mind. But anyone who has the slightest bit of common sense (anyone who believed BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was a true documentary is exempt from reading on further)or basic powers of observation can't help but be offended by this pathetic attempt of literary enlightenment. This Socialists' deep hatred for his paranoid idealogy of the Republican party, the Bush Administration and anyone related to it, seeps through practically every chapter. I challenge anyone to confirm the facts and statements in this book. You will find out, as I did that some people, or authors, will say anything inflamatory to sell a book or make a buck. If this joker could make a buck off of screaming FIRE in a crowded movie theatre, he would and then he'd figure out a way to blame the U.S. and President Bush. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,A great book for anyone restoring an Isetta!,"Having recently fallen in love with this tiny bubble-car made by BMW in the late 50s and early 60s, I was surprised to find myself with one, albeit a fixer-upper, in short time. After going to a minicar and microcar meet, the other Isetta owners said: 'You must buy this book!' and 'This book is truly amazing!' I got the book and indeed they were right: this book is astounding. Mr. Jensen offers insightful step-by-step guidance with useful pointers and tips for every facet of restoring the 1958 sliding window export model of 'the rolling egg.' When I bought my Isetta, the seat and inside panels were missing. Imagine my joy when I found, in the book, templates for the panels and a design for a replacement seat. It was almost a spooky, spine-tingling, X-files kind of sensation. It this thoroughness into the restoration process that I found extremely useful. Indeed, this book is truly amazing and, if you are restoring or upkeeping an Isetta, you must own it."
2,Very Satisfied,I was cery satisfied with the order. It was received in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied and happy with my purchase and would defiantely recommend it to others.I was also pleased to see the item was made in USA you don't see that too often.
2,A Book to Savor,"Robinson has given us a marvelous, engrosing, make-you-think book -- my favorite kind. Highly recomended."
2,MAGNIFICENT ALBUM!!!!,"This is truly magnificent!!!, once again Mike Mainieri brings up a recording that reaches all of your senses; The album evolves beautifully from beginning to end, with very high peaks on ""I've Seen it all"" and ""Flamenco Sketches"", teamed up with Norwegian sax player Bendik Hofseth(he appears on Steps Ahead-NYC)and a group of other wonderful Norwegian players, Northern Lights is simply one of the best jazz offerings of this year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,Hard to find great shoes; these are close,"I'm a guy with distressingly small, flipper-like feet. Throughout my adult life I've found maybe four or five pair of shoes that REALLY fit. These Dockers aren't a pair like that, but they're comfortable, with good cushioning, and every day I wear them they feel a little bit better. They're a good-looking shoe, if unspectacular, and are sturdily built; I can see wearing them for years to come and being just fine with that."
1,Well...,"Well, the game's graphics are ok, but I think that the creators could have used satellite imaging to make real buildings. Outside of the big cities the buildings are the same. And there is no storyline or objectives, so if you want to be bored for half an hour, play this game."
1,Disappointed,THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH AN INK ORDER. THIS ONE SENT ME A 26 AND A 17 INSTEAD OF WHAT I ORDERED ALSO THE COLOR CARTRIDGE IS THE PITS. I PRINT A LOT OF PHOTOS AND THESE CARTRIDGES ARE OF VERY POOR QUALITY.
2,Safety 1st 23 inch wood security gate,The item is good and serves the purpose but it gives you a bit of a hard time to get it set into place. Once it's set though it works great.
2,Another great CD by jagged Edge,"After J.E Heartbreak i didn't think that they could come out with any other cd's that could match that. Next they came out with jagged little thrill and that was pretty good, not as good as J.E. Heartbreak but it still touched the heart. Now its HARD and what a great cd! I don't think that there is a song that i don't like. It has some slow songs, relationship songs and some up beat songs that you can relate to. My favorite songs are girls gone wild, i don't wanna, like to be in love, in the morning, and walked outa heaven.I think that everyone interested in R&B should have a copy of Jagged Egde: HARD."
1,"Lackluster, not blockbuster",I am a big fan of the Twilight series and tore through them while on summer vacation a few years ago. I looked forward to Breaking Dawn but found the hype to be much more than the film itself. I think it was a big mistake to turn the final installation in the series into two separate films (obviously just to increase revenue). I found the ending of Part I to be an odd and disappointing place to cut away. The author knew what she was doing when she wrote the books and it was a travesty what the filmakers did to destroy it in this way. I was left very disappointed by this film. I should have waited for the second part to come out and then watched them both consecutively and perhaps then I wold have been more satisfied. Don't waste your time.
2,Training Day,"I am on an Ian Rankin kick. And this one is pretty good. Rebus is off to training in this one and comes across cold cases that he is able to help solve. Clarke is kind of on her own while he's away, but they eventually come together with their excellent one-two punch. Enjoyed it. Not my favorite by this author, but I enjoyed it."
2,Induced after-death communication,I thoughally enjoyed this book and in fact loaned it to a friend! The information in relieved me and helped me to know there is an afterlfe
2,Sugar Free but not calorie free,"This product uses Sorbitol and Asparthame to add sweetness, instead of typical sugar. The Nutritional Fact sheet on the back of the package said '35 Calories per 4 mints serving'. The packaging also said '40% fewer calories than regular Pep-O-Mint Hard Candy'. There are about 24 individually wrapped in a single bag. Personally, I think it leaves better after taste than other 'sugar-free' candies."
1,"Promising title, disappointing DVD.","First, the technicalities. The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows.Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie."
1,A disgrace to modern literature.,"Hello. I am Francisco González, the leader of the Emerald Forest Association Against Awful Literature(EFAAAL for short). My association has decided to condemn this book as""pathetic."" You will hear more from my frieds, but in short: this book is pathetic. Bad characters, bad form, and insulting morals. I think anyone who likes this book needs to think it over again. You will hear from our people."
2,Free Wearlink Strap,"Great product! I love my Polar FT4; however, I wish that it came with a strap that had more of an adjustment. I am a large guy and was very uncomfortable wearing this strap. As I told the Polar customer service person on the live chat...""the strap rolls on my rolls."" LOL I kept having to adjust the strap in the middle of boot camp and spinning classes. I felt like a high school girl on prom night pulling up her strapless dress the whole night. Anyway I digress, after chatting with the Polar representative and asking if they had a larger strap or extender, she just asked me for my address and said she would mail me a larger strap at no charge. I love Polar products you always get what you pay for, buy a good product and it will pay for itself in the long run with great quality and great customer service."
2,"Great Sound, Great Vocals","I just saw this band play a gig, they blew me away. I know there are a lot of comparisons to other bands etc. I didn't hear it. Personally, I think they have their own sound and it's good."
1,This headset in 3 month is not charging,"I recomend to buy other brand this one is not good, in less that 3 month the battery life last only 2 hrs. (BAD)"
2,Not your typical Witchcraft book thank the Gods!,"Evolutionary, revolutionary, and certainly not anything you would find in a Llewellyn book. Initiated into the Anderson Feri and Reclaiming traditions priestess T Thorn Coyle is a modern witch and teacher of witchcraft.T Thorn Coyle goes beyond your basic 101 magick book and gives her readers tools they can use to transform and revolutionize their lives. The idea that our humanity is where our magic lies has opened up avenues for myself that have made my vision of a life spent where every minute is spent in the sacred a reality. Her book can be ordered at www.powells.com or ask yourindependent bookseller to stock it."
2,"Wow, this CD cooks, with gas.","What can I say about this recording that one listen will not explain. I was into'd to Keith later in his career with the self titled ""Keith Sweat"". Since then I have been all over the map. Next ""Still in the Game"", then ""Get up on It"" now his first recording. To be honest I was into more aggressive music but that was then, now my aggression is getting busy, period.All of Keith's work is at or near the top of the RB game. Considering this was his first effort was it any wonder that he is today at the top?My favorite songs on this recording are ""Rain"" and ""Make it last forever"" also ""sumthin sumthin, sumthin sumthin just ain't right"" I heard ""Something"" recently on KBLX here in SF.Get this CD. Regardless of how you try to classify his stuff quality never gets tired."
2,Nice Sound,Nice sound - would have been great if my mobile was capable of syncing to it. Oops did not check a mobile upgrade will solve that ; )
2,Diaper Champ,It is simpler than I thought it would be. No diaper sausage like with the diaper genie. We use scented bags to curb the smell a little extra. I would definitey recommend it to anyone.
2,Very Nice,"Very Nice looking, Review dimension. Clock a little small, but looks great. Very well made. Keeps time great and look good on the mantle."
1,no service,Never received the game and did not get my money back. Emailed company never got response. Very unhappy
2,Real insight into the thinking of well-known author,"If you enjoy the Spenser novels, you will probably enjoy this - although the novel is not about Spenser. The main character wants to win the fair haired maiden at any cost and in that sense is romantic. What is lacking is any real history of the main character that would give him more life. The ending is like a fairy tale. The main reason I read this was to provide insight into the thinking of the author who created Spenser, who in my opinion is a wonderful character. If I hadn't read the Spenser novels and really enjoyed them I doubt I would have read and enjoyed this novel."
2,Error!,"Otto Winter is not the actual organist!The real organist is MIKLOS SPANYI of Hungary.He made the recording in 1987 and sold it to a german record producer. That record producer sold Spanyi's recording to several labels. Such as Point, Madacy, etc.Some cds say Otto Winter at a Silbermann Organ.Inactuality it is Miklos Spanyi at the Calvary Chuch in Szombathely, Hungary. The organ was built by the Eule Orgelbou of Germany.Mr. Spanyi himself emailed this information to me.Otto Winter is not an organist at all."
1,poor quality screwdriver set,"I needed a good quality hardened steel screwdriver set to take my camera apart and bought the above set as it was labelled as a ""jewelers"" screwdriver set. Well,jewelers use hardened steel and the steel on this set is as soft as 2 hour old macaroni. The first screwdriver I used twisted out of shape on the first turn, the 2nd one twisted out of shape too, neither would loosen the screws. I sent it back to the manufacturer and they quickly credited my account."
1,Worst Album I've Ever Bought,"I've bought a lot of albums over the years, including every one of PFR's albums. This represents the worst album I've ever purchased. Since I am a PFR fan, and actually wanted to like this album, the album may even be worse than I think it is. Nevertheless, it is a shame that PFR would put out this album."
2,Extra Tall Gate,"Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate - White (30"") I have this gate and it functions really well. It is difficult to put together in that you think it is broken because it doesn't seem to come together at the top....BUT it does when you continue to crank it down. I have another brand of shorter gate that is the same system. I did find it in black and my only negative comment is that I would prefer the door walk through be a bit wider. It does stay put."
2,Shimano cassette,"We put this on my wife's Trek 1.5 WSD, we also put on a longer chain. Where we live there are many hills/mountains and the lower gears really work great. Great value for the money."
1,Wow! I blew my money on this????,"Calling Neil Gaiman... Calling Neil Gaiman.... Where is Neil Gaiman? After reading much of Neil Gaiman's work, I seem to have stumbled upon what has to have been one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker and many others have a knack for writing that makes you want to take the day off work just to keep reading. However, this novel was predictable, dull, and devoid of all characteristics that would make most of us want to keep reading.It has been some time since I have been compelled to write a review of a book, but I hope that this review can save even just one more person from wasting their time and money. Do yourself a favour and pick up ANY of Neil Gaiman's other work (WHICH IS FABULOUS I MUST SAY!), but leave this on the bookseller's shelf to collect dust rather than your own. They should give these away free!"
2,Gospel Store owner,"As a store owner i will love to sell this product in my store, if i can get this product or any thing by Juanita, my customers in Trinidad & Tobago will be very happy .At presant there are no distributor for the people of the Caribean.Please to Management give me wholesale prizes and i will bless the hearts through the ministry of Juanita Bynum. Thank you and God bless you richly. Please e-mail me or give me a call at #868-653-8560"
1,Save your money!,"My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
1,Totally disappointed and false advertising,They kept me waiting all this time saying the that they were out of stock and now they cancelled my order. It was false advertising and I would never buy from them again.
2,The Ipod Killer,"No need to write a long review. This is the best hard drive MP3 player you can buy AND, at the current Amazon price, it is now also competitively priced. Add it to your cart and check-out, you won't regret it."
1,Barftastic!,This is the grossest thing ever next to chitlans and liver.(no offense to you liver and chitlan lovers). It taste like preservatives with a little bit of fake cheese. Ick yuck and ewe!
2,Mississippi Fred McDowell @ His Best,"I own quite a few Fred McDowell C.D.'s and let me tell you this is his best on the Arhoolie & Fuel label his stuff doesn't feel as raw as this (no offense Fred) when I hear this C.D. Fred McDowell almost scares me I get chills down my back when I hear the songs ""Six White Horses""(which can only be found here), ""The Girl I'm Loving"", and ""Diving Duck Blues"" Fred McDowell is right up their or even above Son House & other Delta Bluesmen (yes I just went there) and when he pairs up with his wife Annie McDowell on ""Get Right Church"", ""Keep your Lamp Trimmed and Burning"" there right up there with Blind Willie Johnson and his wife Angeline Johnson. All right enough rambling trust me get this C.D. if your new to Fred McDowell or haven't got it yet, also after you buy this get ""Live at the GasLight""(thats a whole other story).p.s. Fred McDowell had been around just as long as Son House, Robert Johnson and others he was just never recorded until the early 60's."
1,Good night light but comes stays on all the time,"We ordered these for my son's nursery hoping it would come on at night & go off during the day, but it ends up just staying on all the time. It is also not very bright, just enough that I can see where I am going, but not enough that I can nurse him by that light alone."
2,Sweet!!,"Brown's book is packed with loads of entertainment, loads of educational information, and loads of stunning anagrams. although the ending is a bit trite, this book will leave you breathless!"
1,Dreadful Mishmash,I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky. This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere. Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows. This is my last Cromwell.
2,So far so good,"These adapters seem sturdy enough. If you need an RCA-to-1/4"" mono adapter, these should be fine, and the price is certainly reasonable.I had some that I bought at Radio Shack a few years ago for three times the price, and the cement that holds the tips inside the shaft would fail. When I removed the adapter from the jack it was plugged into, the tip would remain in the jack. It was very difficult to remove it. So far this has not happened with these.I have some similar adapters that are at least twenty years old, and I've never had a problem with them. These are not quite as substantial as the old ones. I hope these will do as well."
1,Crying Shame,"I own some much better books written by Maggie Shayne; please don't judge the author by this story. I couldn't find the will to finish more than half. Maybe it was written by the author as a pre-teen? If so, it would explain quite a bit. Not worth the time it took to download."
2,"Solid book, but not alot of depth","I have found this book to be a good reference, especially as a quick reference. It is clear and concise. The examples and text however lack detail, as such when using something for the first time I prefer to use other texts that go into greater detail."
2,Great Value!,"I've had this gizmo for several months. It is very easy to setup and just as easy to operate. There's a tiny remote control. But, I never use it - just too small. I just manually push the buttons on the front for ON/OFF & Channel 1, 2, 3 selection. It is a great bargain at about $40 for a TOSLINK switch."
1,Pretty weak tribute,"Far from the real thing... Parsons is hyped way beyond his real value anyway. Some good stuff on here, but really not worth the time or money."
1,"Where's Crib Death, Slug Froma45? ICP you failed me!","A great diservice to a deserving artist. While this had about 12 or 13 good songs on it, I could have did without Jays corny ass interludes. I also felt better songs could have been on here. The best thing about this cd is the album art. I'm giving it a 2 based on the album art and the dozen or so songs that I own on cd anyways."
2,i like it,in crash dummies play slick to rescues dr.zub from junkman after torso.9000 one dummie stay and watch the lab.
2,Drum Prayer is out of this world !,Wow ! This new release from Steve Gordon is really exceptional. I got it as a gift for the holidays and it just blew my mind. The orchestration and exotic insturments are amazing and the blend of vocals with chants from around the world really creates a trencendent sound. I've been blissed out for the past several hours and can't stop playing it. Spectacular and highly recommended !
1,Wayyyy too much musk,"This perfume has beautiful mid and top-notes, but is extremely musky in the low-notes. I walked into a room where someone was wearing it and was nearly knocked over. I couldn't smell my own perfume on myself anymore, as the fragrance was burned into my nostrils for a couple of hours. I am a perfume connoisseur, and I don't recommend this one because it's too ""loud."""
1,Hmmmmm,Greetings: I am a time traveller from the year 1993 and to prove this will be happy to answer any questions from my time!.......That pretty much sums it up (pointless and irrelivent)
2,Suprised,"When I got this glove in the mail I looked at it and said ""This thing is supposed to make my hand feel better?"" It is small and simple in design. I have fairly long hands and the glove is a little tight to get on but fits very snugly. I use it on my left hand, and I was very surprised to find that it actually makes my hand feel a lot better. I use it all the time while at work on the keyboard, or at home while I play video games.I probably wouldn't recommend this for people with very large or significantly wide hands."
1,Disturbing only for die hard war fans,Only for die hard war fans.I did not find this movie enjoyable at all.The characters did not do it for me.
2,"Different, but worthy","While this disc's format is mainly electronic in feel, its unique take on the great Bob Marley is by no means disrespectful. The songs stay true to the tempo and spirit of the original recordings while using the electronic beats more as augmentation. If you like Marley, and you like electronic music, then this would be a welcome addition to any collection."
1,VHS not in working order,VHS does not play properly the tracking is off. Video will not come into focus.
2,Warning: Extremely technical,"This book is very technical, and not for a beginning tailor. However it is an excellent idea sourcebook for anyone recreating Tudor and Elizabethan costumes. Janet Arnold was able to examine surviving pieces of clothing from this period, and has given scaled pattern layouts for many of the garments."
1,It's About Frickin' Mermaids!!!!,"I remember when I was little and I liked Goosebumps' books and there was a new one and it had a shark on it and it was gonna be sweet, cuz I liked sharks too. But then I read it and it was about frickin mermaids! I was so pissed off. In fact, thinking about it now I'm still pissed off.Buyer Beware!!!!!!"
1,Very Disappointing,I would have never bought this movie if I would have known it was dubbed in English. Nothing on the outsite of the DVD box states that it is dubbed in English.
2,Very funny!,"I rank Kevin Hart among the top comedians of all time. With that being said, I enjoyed watching this show. I initially thought it was a movie and it wasn't until I started watching that I realized it was a stand up act. I still enjoyed it because again he was comical. Just know that this isn't a movie."
1,Leases & Rental Agreements (NOLO),"It was not what I had expected and the disk will not run at all no matter what I try and do. What a waste of money.Very, Very disappointed."
2,Can't Get enough!,"I can't get enough of this series...please, please make more! Very classy, accurate for the era, like eating a wonderful dessert."
1,"not ""cables to go"" brand name. Buyer beware!","these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff. although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long. As the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" but this is nothing less than false advertising."
1,Very poor materials (Cheap particle board that cracks),"Screws stick out on top of stand and will the scratch bottom of your speakers.They attempted to mitigate this with very thin spacers provided, but they are inadequate.3 of 4 posts cracked under very light turning of the screws to attach them.Very poor design.Very poor materials (Super cheap particle board)."
2,"A well done manual, no bells or whistles.","Martin Koch has written a very good book on electric guitars. If you have no wood working skill or knowledge, he walks you through the basics, but that is not the point of this book. If you want to build an electric guitar, you ought to have at least the amount of skill and equipment that he outlines. But at the same time he offers an approach that those with few tools and a less than pro shop can handle.So a woodworking manual it is not, but for those of us who are skilled woodworkers, ( I am a professional cabinetmaker ) he offers a well thought out and methodical list of steps and processes to build a guitar. It is not a book for ""idiots"" , which is good, Koch respects his readers, but he also expects a degree of skill and thoughtfulness. A good book on the subject, my copy is already dog eared."
2,More relevant than ever,"I picked this one out when my Dad took me to a paperback book swap when I was about 12 or 13. I loved it for the science and the way it was constructed, never realizing that it was a respected work that would be reprinted in the future. This is mostly because it does become somewhat ""goofy"" toward the end, but it is necessary to the plot.Every few years the title pops into my head as I watch or read news, so I'm off to buy and enjoy it again. Great fun for any fan of negative utopias and those disturbed by the seemingly random and imprudent recombinant gene experiments so popular for profit motives today."
2,One of the most important books I've ever read,"Richard Weaver was one of the best philosopher/writers of this century. This book is far-reaching in scope and theme starting with his first section, The Heritage, which encompasses - The Feudal System, the Code of Chivalry, the Education of the Gentleman and the Older Religiousness - to describe how the world view of the old South came to be.He illuminates the Southern literary renaissance better than any of the poor attempts I've read by others.Using a vast amount of material, published and unpublished, he presents in a very well organized fashion the South's own portrait of itself, as accurately as it has ever been presented."
1,It was just ok.,"I think this movie could have been so much better. Some of the characters were much more interesting than the two main characters and it tended to drag on. If you don't have much going on and want something to watch while you are doing something else this movie is fine. You won't miss anything by having your focus elsewhere. But if you are looking for something to sit down and really watch, keep looking elsewhere."
1,Droning and Moaning,"fitter happier. more productive. if only this were true. radiohead must be some sad sad fools to make music like this. talented, yes. enjoyable, no. if i want to feel the way i do when i hear this, i can go to a funeral parlor. for the time being, i'll be anxiously awaiting the next weezer album."
1,"Been There, Done That","If you have the first Groban CD, don't bother getting this one. They are indistinguishable. The man has a beautiful voice, now all he needs is someone who can choose his music."
2,Excellent product... it your cat is normal.,"This is a wonderful product. It runs quietly, is easy to fill, and most cats will think it's great since it keeps the water tasting fresh.That being said, it did not work out for my cat, who, in all fairness, is not the sharpest tool in the shed. While most cats will happily drink from the Catit by licking the dome, our cat attacked it on several occasions, beating it with his paws and eventually popping the dome right out of its frame.I bought this product based on rave reviews from friends who have been using it for many months and in hopes of finding a method to water my cat without all the water ending up on my kitchen floor (he likes to empty all water bowls in the house by batting the water out with his paws). If you have a weird, water-batting cat, this may not work for you. If you have a normal cat, you (and your cat) will love it."
2,Excellent... A Very Eclectic and Intelligent Book,"Turkel's book combines the best of her research in psychoanalysis, computer technology, and sociology. A readable and thought-provoking work for academics and general public. Timely subject-matter, with a po-mo focus that will make it interesting even in a few years when the technological references will be dated. Somewhat over-emphasizing the Usenet and MUD elements of Internet, with less on the World Wide Web. Highly recommended for those interested in exploring philosophical questions related to ""being"" in the computer age"
1,This band is awful,"Its kinda funny that slipknot sells albums because the only people that listen to them are 12 year olds and posers. I heard this album in my friends car stereo because we were satisfying his little brother. This cd like the others is just pure garbage and noise. Theres no talent to it, its like lincoln park they just write the same song about 30 times and give it a bad title. If you want real metal go pick up Slayer Reign in Blood and Seasons of the Abyss. Sepultura Arise and Roorback. Pantera Vulgar display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. The list goes on, and the truth of the matter is in 10 years slipknot wont even exist anymore."
1,the lube your grandparents used,"We have moved beyond the sticky, slimy lube. Even KY has there own better lube. Try something like ID glide, or the KY intrigue, although that has to be reapplied more often."

2,"Finally, an explanation!","I love Dr. Mona Lisa's work and listen to her on Hay House Radio. Use her books for reference along with Dr. Christiane Northrups' books. Mine are on the shelf next to psychology, anatomy, & physiology texts, nutrition, and spiritual books. The New Feminine Brain is sourcebook about brain functioning, gender, behavior, female and male hormones, family dynamics, medication, therapy models, and so on. You get the picture. There are fascinating case studies in TNFB. This is not a book you sit down to entertain yourself with, ie it is not "" a little light reading."" Use the book to look up what you, or your client, or a family member's issue might be. This is a great book for women (and men) studying medicine, psychology, coaching, and intuition. And women, buy the book for your sanity! :-)"
1,THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters lacked substance. They were very crass and frankly quite dumb. I also felt that Ms. Henley was trying to copy a story I read by Connie Mason called ""THE LION'S BRIDE"",which was a beautiful story."
2,Good info,"I've been looking for a book about paganism that isn't so centered on Wicca. This is a good one. It's a workbook style so that has helped me too. It has a lot of good info in my opinion. I wouldn't say this is a book for someone already well versed on their Pagan beliefs, but it is a good one for those of us just starting down our path."
2,Nice,"Pretty nice stuff. Illustrator with direct Flash support, but without filters. Illustrator 10 is buggy though. Take your pick."
1,doesnt really suction.,I bought the 3 bowl set with the hopes that it would hold the bowl to his high chair tray just enough to enable my son to pick out his finger food without spilling all over his lap. Alas it did not. I feel dissapointed that i basically just bought 3 plastic bowls as the suction part is non functional for more than 3 seconds. Ive tried using dampness to create a better seal and its to no avail. my advice? save your money. this is a great idea but someone has yet to put it into practical implementation.
1,A Wretched Piece of Garbage,"This album is bad. I don't mean ""Hot in the Shade"" bad. It's actually embarassing to listen to. With the exception of ""Naked City"" and maybe ""She's So European"", the songs range from unlistenable to embarassing to unbearable. What made it worse when it came out was that Kiss had previously released ""Dynasty"", which was a bit weak, and then they released this in the midst of the New Wave revolution and it looked like this was going to be it for the boys. Awful, awful, awful album. Give your money to the poor before spending it on ""Unmasked""."
2,Geocaching with eTrex Legend,"We have been geocaching 9 months now now with our Legend, and have had no troubles at all. Accuracy has been great, down to 3 feet, in some instances. Battery life is as advertised or better. The unit holds up well to minor tumbles and everyday abuse with out a scratch. Our only complaint is the size of the display, wished it was a little bigger. A great entry level unit, would buy another."
2,Wonderful Read!,"This tale of cross-dressing soldiers brought a smile to my face, in a way that only Terry Pratchett can! I can only imagine that, back in the day, women really did dress as men to be able to join the military.While giving bit parts to some old favorites, Pratchett introduces a whole new cast of characters to entertain the reader, in this book. Continuing with the theme of all Pratchett books, this will make any reader laugh, not only at the fantastical humor but also at the silly puns incorporated within...This is another of the Discworld series that does not require having read any of the previous books to be able to enjoy it. It would be a great stand alone novel for someone looking for a quick read.And ladies, remember that socks are the key...Courtney ConantAuthor ofThe Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))"
2,"Simple, low-tech, and wonderful!","If you're looking for a digital appliance, with timers and auto-this and auto-that, than you're looking at the wrong oven. However, if you want something that packs a lot of good uses in a relatively small space, this is it. I've roasted chickens, defrosted frozen items, made small pizzas, re-heated pizza slices (vastly superior to microwaving!), baked rolls, cooked small casseroles, and I'm very pleased. The only thing it can't do (at least not to my satisfaction) is toast bread, but that's just a fact about all ""toaster""-ovens I've ever used. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first one I received was damaged (clearly at the factory, not during shipping), and the door on its replacement occasionally requires a tap on one of its hinges when shutting it, or it won't shut completely (I'll fix that, one of these days....) But, all things considered, it's well worth its place on my kitchen counter."
1,32 flavors...,"Alana definitely has some talent, but the fact that she goes and covers an Ani DiFranco song fundamentally without RBR's permission, and then turns it into a teeny bopper hit is a bit argh, shall we say angering. She totally missed the point of the song. save your money and buy Ani's Not a Pretty Girl instead."
2,Best dog & cat brush you can buy.,"I have 5 dogs and 2 cats which generates a whole lot of pet hair! The FURminator is very effective in removing the undercoat and helps to eliminate shedding. I highly recommend it, and you will be amazed at how much hair you get after brushing your pets!"
2,Review,Good review book! It helped me refresh my memory after such a long time! This book is really good for the first time in Accounting field.
2,"everything you wanted to know about the Runaways, but was afraid to ask","better than i expected, that said i really really wish Joan Jett could have contributed to this film. it was never really explained but anyway it was cool to see the indepth interviews especially with Lita- she's great, but Joan is my favorite.i had no idea that kim fowley was such a freak. anyway for those who are interested in the founders of girl punk/rock. this is it!i gave 4 stars instead of 5 cause Joan wasnt interviewed."
2,It's a compelling read,"This book was my introduction to Larry Block and a fine one at that. More than a mystery this book is a real novel! That said, I do think that there are moments when Block is a little bit over the top. In particular with the character of Susan. The long psudo-porn scenes with her brutal to read and add little to the plot. Maybe her sexual obsession is her way of coping in a post 9/11 world, but I didnt buy it personally. I thought everthing involving her was a tad indulgant on Blocks part.That aside though there are pleasure's aplenty here for the decerning reader and I would recomend this book."
2,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This book was given to me as a gift from my mother-in-law. I am so thankful she did give it to me. It is such a wonderful book! It was like God was right there reading these ""love letters"" to me Himself. It really makes you look at your life in a different way. I would recommend this book to any woman! We are all God's princess' and need to know it! :) If you haven't read this book yet, TODAY is the DAY to get it and read it!"
2,Crosley songwriter cd recorder,Produces supurb sound quality CD's from records and tapes--very easy to use! Attractive compact unit. Great for anyone who wants to reproduce records and tapes economically. Speedy delivery service. Highly recommend!!
1,ABC BLOCK BOOKS,The books are just the right size for my 9 month old but she wants to chew them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone whose baby likes to chew books. The books don't hold up. I also found the box they come in combersome for storing. I do like the images. I had to put these away for a later time.
1,Forbidden City- Begiuin and Morel book bad for the money,"I was disappointed at the size of the book for the price. I've seen as the same, and as good historic photographs, on a bigger and better scale. Being in the printing business, I don't believe you take a maginificant picture and put it on the fold. Stupid for so so-called authors Beguin and Morel. Shame, shame, shame. Good subject, very bad presentation."
1,"Why so expensive, Amazon??","The quality of these melts are great. However, why is Amazon selling them for 3x the price they sell for at Michaels?? Amazon please fix the pricing for all of the Wilton candy melts. It appears you will have a lot of sales if the pricing is corrected- I know I certainly would be a regular buyer from you."
2,Great!,"Great product, very durable! I am very happy with this. it was just what i needed. I highly recommend to anyone."
1,This isn't your traditional Peanuts special,"Each year, we anxiously await the airing of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". That's one of our holiday highlights. Last year, we were curious about the new ""I Want a Dog for Christmas"" and tried to sit through it. We made it about halfway through, and couldn't stand to watch the rest. Rerun getting sent to the office for sexual harassment?? C'mon, give me a break. It's too bad that the writers of the new piece felt that they had to slide in such a PC agenda. Just watch the original instead."
2,......* insert something clever here*,"Great cd. It's punk jazz. I personally never thought that was possible. I guess it is, and this band pulls it off spectacularly! If you want more by them here's a hint: they used to go by the name Kara's Flowers. This is a band proclaimed talented by the likes of John Mayer and Jason Mraz. It doesn't have that characteristic richness of regular punk, the guitar is very...well, it's... it's great yes.. what's the word I'm looking for... It's specific, they're songs have some very specific guitarwork. I suppose. Don't listen to me I play piano not guitar. Anyway, great cd, although the guy's voice gets on my nerves after a while. That's just me though, I still like the cd a lot."
2,GCB,"GCB is the best new series! Well written and well cast.I am extremely dissappointed that ABC canceled this gem of a show.I truly hope that all the fan support for this show will mean a reversal of their decision and give the GCB another season.In my oppinion, an earlier time slot would help.I would like to see ABC keep Revenge on Wednesday nights and put GCB in the 9:00 pm Sunday night slot."
1,Don't Torture Youself,This is by far and away the worst Triple Crown book ever. I don't know how a book can be published with words like open being mispelled. The book was double spaced which I really don't understand and I found that truly distracting. From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid. Please don't waste 15 dollars and I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library. This is the worst Triple Crown book ever.
1,Useless as Latin grammar text.,This is a dumbed down introduction to Latin and makes too much of the relation of Latin to English. Not worth the purchase price.
2,Survive Your Cancer Review,I found this book to be well written and chock full of valuable invormation. My hat is off to Barbara for taking the time to help keep others well informed.
2,Used them for years,Always first rate. Work well. I have never had an issue with them. Currently have six of them in use.
2,Excellent edition,"I think I speak for many when I say that after many years of enjoying Tolkien's book, I wanted to have a nice copy for my library. The books I read as a boy show their age and as Lord of the Rings is one of my ""must have"" books, I wanted an particularly special edition. Sound familiar? For like-minded individuals, there are essentially two choices: the single volume with Alan Lee's gorgeous illustrations (he later became artistic advisor for the movies) or the 50th Anniversary Edition. I got the best of both worlds -- bought the illustrated version for myself and this one for my finacee! As nice as the Lee watercolors are, the 50th Anniversary really is the better book. The binding, paper, cover, and feel are amazing... THIS is what a great book should feel like. Also, this is the final revised text, so it is marginally better. Don't let the price discourage you, it is definitely worth it, and this is a book to treasure."
1,"Does not align with Scripture, not a Christian book","If you have spent anytime in Scripture, you will recognize quickly that this book does not bear truth. It adds to Scripture unabashedly and even misquotes it. Do not buy this book if you believe the God of the Bible and are searching for a closer relationship with God. The god of this book is not the God of the Bible. There are authors who are devoted to only spreading the truth...look for them."
2,good book,"Received book almost immediately...enjoyed the contents. So far, this is one of the best books I've read on this subject. I wish i would have read this one first."
2,Excellent Product,I've been using this product for last few months. Audio & Video quality is better than other VCR model. Worth while spending..
1,too small,the book was very misleading.It was a way too small.Hated the size of it.I have a old one that is a lot bigger.
2,"What I wanted, but too expensive.","I was pleased to receive this item right on time, and to find that it was actually an Apple product as they claimed. I do wish, however, that it was not so awfully expensive."
2,Perfect for home users,"Eva Barash's intermediate yoga workout LIVINGROOM YOGA offers up 48 minutes of strengthening fitness routines which use systematic bodily exercises and include special movement and breathing techniques. It's easy to turn a living room into a private exercise room with this yoga instructional, perfect for home users."
1,Don't shoot the dog. Shoot the author for publishing this book and charging people for it.,"Do NOT waste your money. This book is written like a novel, but it is very, very dry and repetitive. I found nothing in this book that I don't already know, not that I'm a know it all. All the examples are human scenarios, nothing related to dogs and there's nothing in this book that actually says, ""ok, this is how you can train your dog."" No specifics or useful tools to help you, the dog owner, help your dog. Bad, bad book, if there was a negative rating, I'd rate this book a ""-2 stars"""
2,An excellent mystery,"This book by Ellis is an excellent mystery. Any mystery reader will enjoy the plot(s) and the characters which are to be found in the book. Without telling the story as others will have already done, it is well written, easy to read, and very interesting. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
1,Certainly not a classic,"""Beyond Management by Objectives"" [1966] by Joseph Batten is rather disappointing and does not live up to the author's reputation. How this short volume ever made it to a second [1980] and then third [2003] printing is beyond me. Clearly his other two books ""Tough-Minded Management"" [1963] and ""Tough-Minded Leadership"" [1989] are superior, though in my opinion ""Tough-Minded Management"" is the better of the two. Readers will be hard pressed to find enough advanced leadership DNA in ""Beyond Management by Objectives"" so as to justify the two hours it takes them to read it."
1,Madonna can do better than that,"I really love Madonna, but this CD is just nuts!!!!! I love her old songs, i bought this CD because it is old, its made in 1987. I thought it would be better, mabe 3 or 2 songs are good out of the hole cd. I would have happily picked 1 star, but i didn't because i love Madonna."
2,Excellent book,I had seen the movie and so I wanted to read the book. It is an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to others.
1,Burnt out in 4 to 5 months,"Very disappointed; 1 of pair lasted 4 months, the 2nd 5 months. Based on Sylvania claims (and price), I thought I was purchasing a superior product. If you read their package materials, Sylvania is very careful not to make any claims for the life of the bulbs...they must know they have a short life.I spoke to local AutoZone; they told me they have had alot of complaints about early failures with Sylvania Silverstars.I compared Silverstar with standard headlight side to side while driving since I changed burnt out bulb in store parking lot so I wouldn't get stopped for a dead headlight. The Silverstar is only slightly better; not better enough to justify the expense of what could be continual replacement."
2,An interresting book to read,"If you are one of those who likes guns, hunting and target shooting, then you're bound to like this book. Why, because it's written by people who know these things first hand, and have military knowledge and background."
2,Nice cage with a lot of extras,"I bought this cage to house a parakeet. The packaging stated that it was for a cockatiel although I would NOT house a cockatiel in this cage. I cockatiel needs a cage at least twice the size of this one. Although slightly smaller than most parakeet recommendations, I feel this cage is large enough for 1 bird. The extras that came with this cage were great even though cheaply made. The cage is not the highest quality but for the price and the items included it is a real good deal."
1,A story with an agenda,"The book contains a large body of information on church music, but it is often accompanied by statements reflecting the writer's personal opinion, unsupported by the material presented. He derives his final conclusion about what ""good"" worship music is from his subjective evaluation of music history, rather than from objective scriptural exegesis."
1,LBD,"I tried to read LBD: It's a Girl Thing by Grace Dent. I tried to like it, I really did. But the writing was weak, the characters dull, immature, and slutty, and just like Louise Rennison's books, she tried so hard, *too hard* to sound quirky that it all came out wrong. I had to stop reading when I got to ""What have the grown-ups got up their sleeves next? Full Muslim burkas to be worn by all under eighteen?"""
1,the picture is of a chrome rams add on! but it is really black!,I ordered this add on for my truck so to spice it up but in all reality it was a plastic stick on and was in a plastic abs black. not very appealing I sent it back.
1,Unreadable,"Reading this book is almost impossible. It is poorly written, and mostly boring. In some parts, the ones in which the author attempts to explain how Geller supposedly cheated on some of his scientific test, the book reads like a Tom Clancy novel - without the suspense. Mr Randi explains in depth the high-tech electronic devices which could have been invented to help Mr. Geller. Yes, Mr. Randi, and the CIA is using your neighbor's satellite dish to read your thoughts..."
2,"I'm Head Over Hooves For ""The Horse Whisperer""!","This book sank deep into my heart. The passion that can exist between two people is amazing, once you find it. This story stirs the emotions of the heart. I'm not one to cry, buy as I finished it, I felt something. It stayed with me for days, I can't even explain it. It was forbidden, everything natural that the characters felt for eachother was overruled by responsibility and priority. Just read this book, then you'll know."
2,Must see!!!,Great movie!!! Must see! Music CD will be the best!! Well done!!! Will become a great franchise!!
1,Not One Of The Best,"This was the first book that I've ever read by James Neal Harvey. I have to say the artistry on the front of the book does absoulately nothing for the actual contents inside of it. I found this book to be a very slow read, that is until the last 100 pages. Near the end things seemed to pick up and go quickly along. The romance that was in the book was rushed through, there was too much police talk in the beginning which may have been what turned me off a little bit. I just didn't find the book to be as captivating as I thought it would be. This only proves one thing ""NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER""!"
2,Suggested gift for the falsely accused,"There are many unexpected gems in this book: Chapter 10 has a wonderful, very useful explanation on anatomical dolls; I particularly liked pages 105, 108, and 112. In Chapter 11 on ""Agencies,"" look forward to page 121. And Chapter 12 describes a volunteer court-monitoring system which excited my pronounced sense of proactivism. Sate your appetite for very useful information. Happy Holidays from falseallegations.com!"
2,fun fish,these are great in the water- really look like real fish swimming- kids get a kick out of them. Makes the pool come alive.
1,Failed 2nd time I used it,"I was very excited to get this after having to get a cast. I followed all the instructions and was very gentle with this item. While putting it on the 3rd time, the rubber cuff tore making it totally unusable. I'm very displeased with the quality."
2,Sailing Back,"This was worth reading for me because Allen Farrell is a legend amonst boatbuilders. Building with hand tools, pieces of driftwood, boats without engines... He was kind enough to include the lines of China Cloud for others to use. Quite a kind gesture for the admirers of such an unusual and beautiful boat. The book is not about China Cloud but about the Farrells. This book tracks their history in BC and what the people and country used to be like. There are a number of replicas of China Cloud being built.G. Bowen"
1,chair leg pads,"These are much smaller than I thought they would be and are not useful for the situation intended. The stick-on felt pads don't work at all on chair legs so I needed an item like this with the felt factory attached. If they had a larger version of these, I'd buy it today."
1,Needs Improvement,If you are new to SQL server and want to know the basics of the application then this books if your you. If you want to pass the exam however then I suggest you look else where. The material is too simplistic and there are too much typo errors. I read the book twice before turning to other materials like the Transcenders and Self Test software and I must say had it not been for the other materials that I used I would have failed the exam.
2,Like it a lot,I've been enjoying this product for months. The only drawback is that it doesn't have anyway to stay in place - would be great if it had a strap or something else to keep it in place.
1,Not worth the glass used to master it,"The fact of the matter is that this is a bootleg and a poorly mastered one at that. Ozit has mastered this all from inferior mp3s sourced from high gen tapes that have been circulating among Beefheart collectors for years.The show itself is a great show and although a lower gen mastering in HD isn't going to necessarily improve the fidelity of this audience recording. I still can't recommend this to anyone but completists who wish to collect every single release.This is definitely not a good place to start if you are looking to check out the music of Captain Beefheart. For that you are better off with something like Spotlight Kid, Clear Spot, Trout Mask Replica or Doc At The Radar Station."
2,Excellent summer read,Highly entertaining and intelligent. It will make you laugh and think at the same time. A social commentary page turner. Excellent.
2,RELIABLE PRODUCT - RELIABLE COMPANY,"In the large number of envelopes we've orderd over the years there has not been one with a flaw. We rhink that's pretty good for an item that is undoubtedly mass produced. Obviously, we're well pleased with the product as we continue to order.Also, obviously we have not always done business with this company - wish we'd known about them sooner. Their service is prompt (a confirmation of order within 24 hours along with UPS tracking number). The envelopes are always well boxed so they arrive undamaged. Couldn't ask for more.We recommend both the envelopes and the company."
2,great ARPG game ever,"this is probably the best game i've played for the longest time.the battle chest set comes with all the CDs for diablo 2 and also it comes with diablo 1, which i didnt really play before. but it should be a good game.it also comes with a lot of information about the products from blizzard, i think most people know what blizzard is.no more need to say,lets enjoy the game.oh,btw, the CD-KEYs really worked.lol.."
1,WORST GUI I have ever seen,"The GUI (the way it looks) for this program is horrible. Seriously, it's confusing and an abomination. It's the exact opposite of most other Mac software - clean and polished and easy to use without reading the help manual. Quicken for Mac is anything but.I actually bought VPC just to run the windows version on my mac...."
1,spirituality and energy control,"The author believes that there are parallels between the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, each stage representing a 'rite of passage' that must be honored in order to ascend with physical and spiritual health to the next. I found the parallels interesting and wonder if the similarities she perceives have their roots in mystic traditions that unfortunately gave way to the construction of organized religions. In any event, she made one statement that I suspect is the crux of spirituality. To paraphrase, ""We were put here on earth to learn to manage our energy"". Use this book as a springboard to others that address this issue more directly, like God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam."
1,The Rule Of Four,"The first rule for the rule of 4 is to not buy this book. I was enticed by the notion that this might be a DaVinci Code equal. I was 100 pages into the book and was still not sure what all the nonsense was about. I guess the second rule is - beware of dual authors. I slipped this time, not again!"
2,Missing accessories,"The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!"
2,"Not a fan of the genre, but this is very well written","I am not a big fan of the Contemporary Fiction - Dysfunctional Family genre of fiction, a genre that sadly dominates American literature. For me, a contemporary work in this genre needs to be exceptional to even crack a 3 rating.The Corrections is one of those exceptions. The genre is so, so tired, but the Corrections is so masterfully written, both on a level of prose and in the realistic construction of the protagonist family, that I have to give it a 4. This book is very well done."
1,"Misleading promotion, missed opportunity","RATING = * * 1/2Promotion for this film led us to believe it was a little mystery wrapped in a comedy. While a bit of both, it wasn't enough of either to give it the identity it needed. And that's a shame.Given the premise -- Anniston suspects she might be the love child of The Graduate's Ben Braddock -- this held a lot of potential. But once the jig was up, there was no place to go. We were left with under-developed characters and story lines that were shallow and incomplete. Opportunity lost.The likable Anniston has a few good turns and Costner delivers a solid performance, but even they couldn't fill-in the missing pieces. A-List stars and slick production alone do not a good movie make. At least not enough to fill 90 minutes or warrant a $10 ticket or $20 purchase."
1,Warning about buying HD DVD movie,This came nicely in original packaging however does not work in the DVD or blueray player.
2,Gorgeous book--a must have!,"As gifted as she is controversial, Leni Riefenstahl's ""five"" lives are imminently fascinating as this impressive book will prove! Even to the uninformed or casual observer, this edition will entrance. A great addition to your library, especially if you are impressed by the 102 year old dynamo who continues to prove filmmaking and photography as an art form. A living testament to the fact that ""bodies in motion, stay in motion!"""
2,The best of the middle-tier video cards,"Easy to install and very few campatability issues. If you don't want to spend close to five-hundred dollars to get the next best card this 6800gt is a solid performer. In fact if your motherboard can support it get 2 of these and the SLI results are the smoothest you can get.Nvidia uses the same drivers for almost all its cards and funcitionality is good without being overwhelmed. About the only time I would say buy an ATI version card instead would be for the consumer using multiple monitors and/or watching TV from the card. These are not Nvidia's strongest areas, since speed and throughput are what you are buying.For features and customization ATI's Catalyst COntrol Center far outshines any software Nvidia offers. Of course with the customizations comes conflicts if the user is not experienced at tweaking"
1,This is retarded,"Why in the heck, would they try to get ppl to buy a c-d with 3 songs on it. let alone, you only need to get hybrid theory and meteora for the total amount of songs they have done! why waste the money???"
2,the impossibles-back for the attack,"the impossibles really hit that 97-98 ska sound with this 5 song ep. but its not that usual cookie cutter ska that we all have become so accustomed to. it has a different sound, with some harder, heavier moments, and some really catchy choruses. if you want a great, short cd that gives you a taste of what the impossibles really stood for before the year 2000, this ep is for you. there are some great songs that will definatly give your stereo a run for its money. the first song, Plan B, is possibly the best song that the Impossibles have ever written. actually, it could be one of the best ska songs to come out of that era. if youre a fan of the more recent material, such as songs from Return, or stuff after 2000, you probably wont like this, but its good to get to know where the band's true roots came from. either way, this ep is definatly worth your money, if your a fan of the impossibles, or just a fan of ska in general."
2,Great Book for Class!,Book is a great deal of help for the class I am taking and should help tremendously for future psychology classes.
1,Disappointing,"The Regency Christmas anthology that comes out each year is a treat. However, this year, the stories are rather boring. The problem with anthologies is that there usually good stories and bad and one just hopes the good outweigh the bad. Not in this case. Boring, boring, boring and sooooo unromantic."
1,"Overpriced, not very useful","I'll be taking the USMLE in a few months, and i got this book to try to improve my study habits in anticipation of things to come, since it claims to have ""powerful strategies to help increase your score"".I have to say that for $30, this book is way overpriced and as a study aid it is completely useless. Buy this only for questions, because there are no ""strategies"" presented here. That section of this book is mostly just vague repition about studying a lot and testing yourself, and there is no clear study method presented.One of my friends recommended a smaller and cheaper, yet BETTER book called ""How to study for the USMLE"". I found it much more useful, with a clear, defined study method presented, and even more tips and strategies for doing well.If you're going to get a book to help you ace the USMLE, there are better options out there."
1,jez,This is garbage. I know you get what you pay for but Grizzly has not let me down in the past. It came unbalanced. What a disappointment.
2,The best straightener ever!,This is the best hair straightener I have ever used. It heats up FAST and it straightens your hair fast. What can I say other than its the BEST!
1,Don't be ripped off,"This disc is made up of practice sessions and other second-rate material. It is made from stolen goods and many of the tracks bear only a passing resemblance to the original songs from the LP's. If you are a Starbuck fan at all, you will be hurting them and yourself by buying this product.Instead, go to the artist's site at Moonlight Feels Right dot com, and buy the disc being sold by the original artist, instead of rewarding and encouraging thievery."
1,Very easily came undone with shoulder straps!,I used the bag about 4 times to carry my rather light Yamaha P-95 keyboard to band practice (only 26 pounds). The bag tore out the seems under where the shoulder straps connect to the bag. I can see where they absolutely should not have put the ability to connect shoulder straps with such low quality seem connection. So... you CANNOT use the bag with shoulder straps. I now have a bag with 2 wide open seems to the insides of the bag - not good.
2,Stargate SG1 season 7,I had only 2 more seasons to collect to complete my Stargate SG1 series. I am so happy I was able to find this on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Thank you!
2,Still Got It!,"Boston Legal - William Shatner at his best, especially Season One! This is the one that gets you hooked!"
2,Travel Humor at its Best,"Edited by Doug Lansky, author of Up the Amazon Without a Paddle, There's No Toilet Paper on the Road Less Traveled can really be appreciated by those who have actually made the same mistakes. If you have then you'll be in good company with humorous travel accounts from Steve Martin, Dave Barry, David Letterman, Dennis Miller and Fran Lebowitz. If you haven't made the same cultural faux pas then you can at least sit back and have a good laugh at those who have. Two personal favorites include, ""Nudity is a State of Mind"" by Alan Zweibel and ""Under the Spell of a Witch Doctor"" by Rory Nugent. There's No Toilet Paper... on the Road Less Traveled is truly good travel humor at its best."
2,Just want I expected,"This product works perfect. Easy to set-up, easy to store, easy to carry, easy to start, all around very simple and perfect for what it is for. The only downside I experienced was trying to use 2 medium/large pans on it at once. I could do it, but I had to take down one of the wind shields. It was kind of windy at the time, but the burners still stayed lit, so obviously it was not much of a problem.This thing gives off plenty of heat and is so easy to start, use and set-up with no tools required. I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,Excellent Popcorn and Healthy Too,I've been eating this popcorn for years. It is always cruchy and consistently excellent. I highly recommend it.
1,Wasn't pleased,"I wasn't pleased with this video. I found it had a very lowbudget, which meant distant shots, unknown actors who really couldn'tact, and lighting that was atrocious. In addition, staging was bad,and you had trouble seeing who was talking. It also had nothing to dowith the Mark of the Beast, 666. It's about aleged conspiracy by thegovernment in UFO's. It's hard to follow and understand. I eventhought the video would be good since it's about alleged gov'tconspiracy, but the moderator whined a lot and spoke in a monotone andwhen scenes would show about something, they would only last a secondand then back to the moderator. Don't waste your money or time on thisvideo. YOU WILL REGRET IT if U do. END"
1,"Good dialogue, undeveloped plot","I have read several of the Spenser books. This one started very promisingly, with witty dialogue and an interesting background. But about halfway through the book, the plot gave out. Spenser gets a lucky (too lucky) break when he spots a certain photograph, but the thread it offers to unravel the mystery is only minimally drawn out. The murdered woman remains a cipher to the end, her secrets barely unveiled. Too many secondary characters are mere page-filling red herrings (the sexy secretary, the sexy Southern detective, the overaggressive teenager). The murderer eventually just confesses his/her guilt to a passive Spenser. And, worst of all, at the last moment, to create the illusion of closure, the author invents a new, unrelated crime, both nameless and motivationless, so that Spenser can have one of the suspects arrested in a sham climax. A good premise gone nowhere."
2,Love the sound samples,Certainly somewhat pricey but well worth it if you need the added sounds. Now I have an entire choir and MORE added into Garage Band
2,Explains what you need to know,"Can you copy that pretty picture or graphic that you saw online to use for your personal website or brochure?That's the question that I face every day because I do quite a bit of professional work with graphics.I don't have time or money to have a professional copyright lawyer on my staff to help me decypher when I'm using a graphic legally. This has led to me always buying exclusive licenses or nonexclusive licenses for virtually every graphic that I use but this adds a ton of costs to any production project.This work opens up the public domain to me so that I have a thorough understanding of what's legal to use from public domain information and what is not. I love this work, it's written clearly and plainly and with it really helps me understand this important realm (public domain).It really helps me respect the rights of others while at the same time allowing me to open up the world to low cost content options."
1,Not researched well enough to really do that much good.,I wasn't that impressed with this book although I agree wholeheartedly with her message. A very sloppy effort on her part.
2,Best info,Really enjoying the info loaded inthis book. I love hoe it adjusts the training to the disability. I highly recommend it!
1,"Amateurish, typical","This books seemed to me to be written very amateurishly. It read like a conversation with a friend, unfortunately its content seemed only about that reliable. While the author starts out talking about sleep functions, etc., she then moves on to give gobs of tangentally-related parenting advice...my point being that this ""info"" was merely opinion, and an unprofessional-sounding one at that. She didn't back up what she said in a substantial way, and I found that in fact, she didn't offer any real solutions to people in dire need of a sleeping child. At best this book offers guidelines that would be good to keep in mind before a baby is born, and a bit of info on infant sleep patterns."
2,Gift idea,I got this thinking that I would give them out as gifts. These are great knifes and made really well.I recommend this product fully.
2,Bad Brains are back...and better than ever!,"Reggae and hardcore punk? Yes, that is what the Bad Brains new album is all about! Sure it sounds strange, but the Bad Brains stuff is amazing. Although the whole album is good, my favorite song is either ""Give Thanks and Praises"" or ""Pure Love."" The album is completely different from anything out there right now and is definitely worth a listen if not a buy!"
2,As Good As They've Always Been,"This is the first CD from Jackson Browne of acoustic live material, in what I hope becomes a long running series of volumes. His voice is still as crisp as when these songs were first recorded. The sparse sound of only a piano or guitar really highlight how well written and thought out the lyrics are. The production is perfect with great sound quality, and they gave the introductions their own tracks. This avoids having to listen to a minute or more of Jackson talking. If you are fan you owe it to yourself to pick this is up. Jackson Browne is timeless!"
2,Excellent Ending,"The film was a little stale in the beginning, but by the end of the film, I completely adored it. The film happens to be chocked full of beautiful men, which doesn't hurt either. Brad Pitt and George Clooney do a great job as the center of the film, being the ring leaders. I happen to think that George Clooney steals the show. If you plan to watch the film, the ending makes the entire film worth it. I don't want to spoil it, but it's really, really good! Overall, the film gets a 4/5 because of the somewhat boring beginning."
2,"Unique, breathtaking, a must buy.","FOX marketed this as a western. I hate westerns. I LOVED Firefly. The final (original?) two-hour episode ""Serenity"" is still lovingly saved on my TIVO because we can't bear to part with it. The writers of Firefly created characters that are human - not an idealized or perfect one in the bunch, all have their secrets and flaws. In spite of that (because of it?) the viewer is left with a deep connection and a desire to know them better. This isn't all CGI flash. It isn't just schmaltzy character development and human interest either. Firefly is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a very long time, and it is a tragedy that FOX didn't realize the gem they had and promote it properly. Buy the DVD set and watch it - you'll see fantastic acting, action, adventure, suspense, science fiction, frontier justice, and yes, great special effects."
1,disappointrd,my original ac adapter for my kindle broke - an inexpensive adapter was advertised-i fell for a cheap fix and it did not work . i was disappointed .
2,Great item!,I didnt want to spend the $18.00 on theese strips because I doubted them.. Luckily I had a coupon from Michaels it was 50% off one item so I bought the 4 pack. The strips worked well . My cakes come out perfect I also use them when I make cheesecakes it is easier than the waterbath method!
1,"Time are tough, stop double dipping","With today's economical woes, you are still willing to screw over people out of their hard earned money? Boo to New Line. Just boo."
1,awful,What? I am so confused. I thought the two male leads were friends and the older man wanted to be with the younger one. Ugh when I read that they were father and son I really wanted to change the channel. I didn't enjoy this film at all.
1,Can adversity lead to peace?,"I did not like Prisoner's Wife and I did not dislike the book. While it had no redeeming message for me, I cannot say that Ms. Bandele's experience is invalid because it is not my experience.As I read, I kept a sad feeling because she appeared to be defined by so many negative life circumstances (ie, sex abuse, drug abuse, abortion, prison experiences, etc.) I guess she wanted to let the reader know her love for Mr. Rasheed was her empowerment, but, I could not tell if she found peace at the end of the book."
1,There are better choices...,"After listening to a couple of tracks, I was very disappointed in this CD. Nothing prepared me for a collection of live performances recorded from Tom's TV appearances. Even though there are quite a few tracks on this CD, I'm not sure I would have forked over (money) for it (...). The instrumentation is weak, but Tom belts out each tune with the same enthusiasm which makes him the legend he is... Buy something else!"
1,Has no industrial value,Fan is to weak for any other than small room home use. But theres better models for that so I say boo.
1,Only a Hell House if your fear is dying of boredom,"I don't read much horror fiction, so I was expecting this book to be interesting, with a lot of suspense and gore, but it was so boring I would have returned it if I could (I bought the Kindle version). The most interesting bits were in the last 10%, like, the last 5 pages. The rest read more like a little kid's idea of ""scary"" pornography. Seriously. ""Oh my god, maybe she's a lusty lesbian in denial!"" Oooo, scary. Which, I must say - if you are disturbed by sexual violence, this book might likely bother you.It seemed like he meant it to have a psychological ""fear of the true self"" element but it was soooo shallow it was truly comical. And there's more interesting attempts at scientific phenomena in Pullman's His Dark Materials. MAYBE if I believed in ghosts I would have been more entertained, but I seriously doubt it. It maybe would work better as a graphic novel. A total yawn."
1,4th No More?,"Loved ""1st to Die"". Liked ""2nd Chance."" Hated ""3rd Degree."" Is it because this ""Andrew Gross"" person might have wrote it??? If you read ""1st to Die"" and immediately ""3rd degree"" afterwards, you would not believe that the same person wrote the two books. ""3rd Degree"" shouldn't even be part of the ""Women's Murder Club"" series since only one of the 4 characters has a major role and he kills one of them off. Perhaps if James Patterson writes the 4th novel in the series (without Andrew Gross), I might be interested to read it. Otherwise, I'll pass on this series."
1,Not worth the bother.,"I got this to put in the bottom pool of my fountain. The instructions and illustration were not all that helpful so called number providid to clarify. It ended up being a pain to hook up as the cord from light to all the other parts was too short so the placement was not what I wanted. Additionally, it only worked for 3 nights. Not happy with this product at all."
2,Wow,"This is really a great inflatable bed. Many people who have tried it, after parties, have loved it. If your regular bed is uncomfortable, you're gonna want to sleep in this bed instead! I bought two and told my friend, he bought two as well. The bed being raised is a big plus, it really is. Good Price!"
2,Works as intended,"I like the Topeak line of products. Well builtand good customer support. Works well as a fender,also. I leave it on my bike, even when I'm not usingthe pack."
1,Plextor vs. ASUS,"Bought this unit for Christmas. Had it installed by computer tech. Software splash page would appear but clicking on links crashed machine. Reinstalled, uninstalled and reinstalled no luck. Computer tech installed it on his personal machine same result. Both machines have latest motherboards and exceeded the minimum hardware requirements. Contacted tech support and have been passing emails for over a month now with no help from Plextor. Went and bought ASUS burner for half price and installed perfectly and runs great."
1,Again another hot cover but,"This series should have stopped with the season before this one. This installment of the series was just getting kinda pointless. The characters are kinda one dimensional, and they try to make it dramatic and real to life but they fall short.Save your money and get something more valuable. Again the cover is cute but thats about it."
2,Wow,Just returned from El Salvador. This really gave me perspective. Acting was superb and the story line was similar to one I heard while there. Afraid it was all too common
2,"C to the H to the R- I- S, I say yes to your album","Damn, I bet Chris is getting all kind of shortie with this tight album.Chris Brown's debue album is pure R&B; gold, his songs have all the right things in all the right places. From the Intro to the ending track, Thank you, you'll be chillin' with ya homeboys to an album that puts anyone from 50 to the Peas too shame. It's pure R&B; with the perfect dash of hip-hop. Plus you got a remix of Run It! with Bow Wow and Jermiane Dupri. Say word!Man, Virgina will be representing Chris prodly for years too come. You can't go wrong with this album."
2,Deals with a serious subject in an entertaining way.,Back in the Daze is an entertaining book that deals with drug addiction. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with a drug addiction.
1,Doesn't work in stereo mode.,Bought this for my cell phone so I can have hands free and stereo mp3 access. The first one didn't work in stereo just mono. The company promptly sent me another one ( didn't want he broke one back). Got #2 and the same thing was wrong. I tried it in 3 different cell phones and even 2 different 2.5mm house phones with no luck. You get what you pay for but you should get what is advertised ( Stereo ). Company was top notch though.
1,Sardines for sale,"I like spicy food and I like sardines, but I don't like these. I simply cannot finish my pack of 10 cans. I like other Vigo sardines and I wouldn't say these are low quality, but something about the mixture of these strong flavors doesn't work for me. I can taste them for hours."
2,Whistle Lanyards,What can you say: it's just a lanyard. I buy these for all my volleyball referees on the NYC Board because of the good quality.The seller was very efficient and quick with the order - a great pleasure to deal with. I will buy from them again next year.
2,Still using these forms 7 years later!,These forms are extremely extremely useful to a photographer starting out. I've used them for about three different companies and recommend this book to all my assistants... Bravo!
2,Works Well,"This tool works well for what it is; if you lose your disc in the middle of a stream where you can see it but don't want to actually wade through the stream to get it, then this is the perfect tool for you. However, don't expect too much of it; you're not going to toss blind into white water rapids and start pulling out free discs by the dozens. It's not actually a golden retriever, it won't get your paper in the morning, shoes in the afternoon, or a beer from the fridge in the evening. Conversely, you won't be on pooper scooper duty with this in tow, but it might still be your best friend."
1,misrepresented waste of time,Total piece of junk. A grown up flick w/kids thrown in the mixso parents blow 50 bucks at the movies. Had my two kids not beenthere w/me I would've walked out after 20mins. And demanded mymoney back'
2,Torchwood season two,"Torchwood is awesome, however it would have been really nice if Amazon could have posted me a version that i could actually watch on Australian dvd players, considering it was being shipped to Australia and all..."
1,Bad Stitching,"We bought 3 of these bags & 2 of the 3 were defective. The straps were not stitched well & broke 10 min into our hike. We had to tie different straps together to continue the hike. We are returning them for a refund, beware check stitching if you buy this backpack."
2,Best Gluten Free White Bread Mix,"Although I would never confuse this bread with the real French Bread, it is by far, the best gluten free white bread that I have made - from mixes as well as from scratch. The mix is milk free - wonderful for those of us who have to avoid milk products. The texture of the bread is very close to traditional white bread made from wheat and does not become ""grainy"" even after several days in the freezer. I think it it's easy to make, whether by traditional oven method or in a bread machine. One of the very few bread mixes I highly recommend."
1,Broke way too easy,"Bought this for my daughter and it broke within months. very poor quality. It looked great when we got it and she only wore it to church and family outings, not to play sports."
1,Not a good read!,"Don't get me wrong, i'm an avid bsc fan! but what i don't like is how it seems like the kids in the books are being forced to grow up so fast. I mean, the triplets one minute are big brats and the next are sitting for 10 year olds? Yeah, right!"
2,Perfect Curls!,I have used these Conair Swizzlers for many years and I will not go back to any other kind of rollers. I have very long hair and I like to wear my hair up in a french bun or just straight down. I use these rollers on the top and bangs and curl them tightly. Then I fluff my hair using my fingers instead of a comb or brush to separate each strand of hair. I get more fluff using my fingers. Then I gather the ends and pin to the top and back or I leave my hair straight down. My hair looks so fluffy and full of curls. It is amazing how these little curlers work! It's fun to experiment different styles of hair-do's. I use it also on my little grandchildren. It doesn't burn their scalp and they are light weight. My children even use the rollers as a toy. They make circles and chains. It's fun and they are great! You have to try them at least once. I guarantee you will be satisfied.
2,Super hero costumes,My 3 year old LOVES these costumes. The capes are a little long for him yet but not to the point that he will trip on them. He loves the fact that he can choose who he's going to be each day. This was a great investment for our family.
1,Swiffer Company...are you listening?,"Handy to use and seems to work fine. However, Swiffer should have used Lithium Ion batteries on this product. The battery life is unacceptable and this is due to nickel cadmium battery, which no one wants anymore. I will not buy any more cordless tools or devices that do not come with Lithium Ion batteries. Swiffer....use Lithium Ion and charge another ten bucks. I would be more than happy to pay extra knowing that the battery life will allow me to do more than my kitchen. Just my take on the matter."
2,Frightfully Disturbing ... and Amazing,"This movie is one of the most powerful I have ever seen. It addresses the issue of race in such an amazing way, linking together so many stories and so many people in so many ways. It isn't just a black and white issue- it's black, white, Asian, Hispanic. It's fear, stereotypes, frustration, anger. As soon as you've decided one person is a villain, he does something truly extraordinary. As soon as you've decided one person is a hero, he does something despicable. Everyone walks a thin line, and the movie Crash does a wonderful job of portraying that- the cause-and-effect relationships that impact everyday interactions, and how other people put a slant to those interactions, based on their previous experiences.I highly, highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone- it will make you think. And think. And think."
1,Ambiguous and Lacks Organization,"To learn the details of GSM, this is not the book to choose. The text contains a vast amount of information but not in a manner which is readily understandable. There seem to be holes in the explanations and, in some instances, contradictory statements. After two days (well, one was a Friday so maybe that doesn't count as a whole day) of trying to make sense of the chapter on logical channels and frame structure, I am at Amazon looking for an alternative.This book makes me want to learn enough (from some other source, of course) to write my own book."
1,Misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book was NOT written by Robert A. Heinlein! It is a book about prostitution written by a former prostitute. I found out the hard way by buying this book. Do not buy this book. It is NOT written by Robert A. Heinlein.
1,This CD iz Aight...........,FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT.....

AND I LIKE TO GIVE A SHOT OUT TO MY SOLDIERS.. HOODY HOOO....
1,Warm Stripes,"I had high hopes for this item, but it fell far short of my expectations. Instead of the entire towel getting warm, as I had hoped, only the sections that came in direct contact with the warming bars became warm. Essentially, all you get is small stripes of warmth."
2,"Great flick, could have added a ""teen years"" segment","I loved every part of this flick, but agree with an earlier review of the necessity of ""epic-ness"". I would think that would include a little on the ""teen years"". Kinda like you always wonder about Jesus' teen years. Show me that, too, please. All in all, great flick. Momoa was perfect as Conan in the sense people are used to: blending the Frazetta idea and R E Howard's vision of the character. Smarter than the Arnold Conan. And your average bear. Emotion, reaction......Awesome.The leading lady was good as well. They made her somewhat tough on her own, which is good. Conan wouldn't want a damsel in distress in that way.I hope they do a sequel, there is is a lot more can be done with Conan, and keep Momoa.If you like Conan at all,you'll enjoy this film."
2,"A little too heavy, but very sturdy","I like that this is a metal turner, but it's a little too heavy. I have had my share of flimsy spatulas, and I wanted something that was a sturdier product. However, the size of this item is much larger and heavier than I expected or needed. Again, this is a great product, but expect something heavy and large. Perfect for grilling, not so much for pancakes."
2,Stylish,"I love this so much it makes my bathroom look nice, its very sturdy so it never falls, Im actually thinking about buying another for my boys bathroom."
2,Excellent printer for the money!,"I had the use of this model Brother laser printer as editor of my club newsletter. When I gave up the job the printer, which was owned by the club, went to the new editor. I liked this machine so much and missed it so much that I ordered one for myself. It is fast and efficient at printing double sided and collated pages."
2,Most comfortable slippers ever,"I've bought slippers for years. It's hard to find the kind I like: high ankle coverage, soft insides, tough rubber soles/heels so they can be used outside, and feel both secure on your feet and comfortable while you wear them. These meet all those criteria. Can't speak to the ""long lasting"" issue because they're too new, but they look pretty sturdy, so I'm hopeful. Can't speak either to the ""always available"" issue either because they're so new, but this is a popular brand so I'm hopeful there also. I've been frustrated in the past when a pair of slippers wears out by being unable to find suitable replacements. I hope I'll never have that problem again!"
2,Pretty good for a summer read,"This is a book about pirates, their lives, their conquests, their brotherhood and their deaths. It's not a historically precise piece, and it's not going to win a Nobel prize for fine literature. All that aside its a great book to read when you want a pirate book that's less fluff and more adult than a Disney's adaption. It's well written, has a good plot, interesting characters and is unpredictable enough to keep you interested till the end. Don't forget to have some of the Capt. Morgan around to set the mood."
1,A game that is less than the sum of its parts,"This version of Civ is a poor attempt to update those great earlier games, Civ and Civ 2. While GT took a lot of thought about what might be neat to add to the game, they put little thought into how these additions would affect game play and balance. I found the game interface difficult, the new additions unbalancing, and the entire game to be a frustrating experience. I give them an extra star for creativity, but while some parts are nice, this game is a failure on the whole."
1,Not as good as their debut,"Not nearly as musically interesting as their debut, self-titled, disc. On Looking Through, the tracks seem to blend together with no amazing standout tracks. I suppose you can give them props for not trying to hard to produce a single, but it feels like they didn't try to hard to produce any truly great songs.If you're new to PMM, get their self-titled disc. Looking Through is mostly for the hardcore fans who are mostly interested in supporting a band who showed tremendous potential with their first album."
1,Terrible movie,"I'm obviously in a minority here. But IMO the movie just sucked. The thing that irritated me throughout the movie was the darkness and by that I mean the absense of light. The lighting is artificially dimmed for effect and it just doesn't work. Nobody works and lives in such poor light. The black and white film noirs work beautifully, but this movie seems stage-managed. Amongst contemporary movies, the lighting in &quot;Dark City&quot; was very natural and fit in well with the theme of the movie. This is a one gimmick movie and it got old within the first 5 minutes. I count this, along with &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; as amongst the worst 10 movies I have seen."
2,Beautiful and informative,Great to look at and also really informative. These recipes aren't the typical bowls of oil associated with Spanish cooking as it's known internationally. The information on the various regions is a really nice touch too. Probably the only Spanish cooking book you need.
1,Basically worthless as a bike support,Unfortunately this device does not work. It is just a piece of cheap plastic and unless your bike weighs less than perhaps 5 lbs it most likely will fall over. Amazon is a great (.com) company and should remove this worthless product from their inventory. The wheel arch is totally unstable and from the photos it looks sturdy but do not be fooled I think you may be sorry you purchased it. I am amazed at many of the other reviews that are positive but I do not know if they use it to support a kids tricycle or toy.
1,just okay,This product is not great. It is a really small quantity for the price. It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky but it does not really add anything to my face care process. I finished the lotion and moved onto a different one and had no change in how my face feels or looks. I think you can get a better product for less money elsewhere.
1,hmmmm........,"do you get the impression that all these 5 star reviews are sorta the same? they all say the same-o-same-o. this game sucks cuz the graphics are the worst of any final fantasy game EVER. the hero looks so lame, i wish he had just got blown up or somting. overall a F-."
2,Bought them for my husband and he loves it!,"Great price for such a comfortable pair of indoor slippers. I was wary of another reviewer's comment about the triangular logo that's stitched exactly where the heels will be resting on. But I'm glad my husband said it was perfectly alright and he didn't think of it at all. Since he wears it daily and likes it, I consider it money well spent."
1,return this now,All Star Baseball 2003 is one of the most overrated baseball game I have ever played. It is almost impossible to hit the ball. And when your in the field and A batter hits a fly ball the camera trys to look real by moving in slowly and if its a line drive it will go past you. On rookie mode the ball comes in so fast its almost impossible to hit the ball. To many strikeouts and too little game play. In the instruction manual it tells you nothing.
2,omg u r soo true,"omg i read what the person from Agoura Hills said about this cd and thats exactly what i think every timei listen to it i'm not saying this is a bad cd, i happent o be a fan but those guys need to think about there lyrics more"
1,I second the last comment,I knew it was too good to be true but these false sellers are taking up space on this website.
1,nothing new here,"Lose weight, stop smoking, drinking, coffee, become a veggie, yadda yadda. Nothing interesting or new here. I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
2,Review of Gizmo Electric Can Opener,"So far, so Good. I like the cordless ability and it has opened every type of can I've put it on easily enough. Works great!! I would recommend it to anyone. We'll see how long it lasts!!"
2,Great DVD,"I have owned the CD and book since January 2004 and after alot of thought, I brought the DVD. I loved it alot. Some of the songs and scenes are not on the CD or book, which is great. A thing I would like to say. I had no problems playing the DVD on my Australian PS2 games and DVD player connected to a common medium sized TV one can get here."
1,Don't buy this one!,"Contained a brief entry on modernism, but not a word about postmodernism. Let alone postcolonialism...A dictionary is no good if it doesn't have the words you want to look up!"
1,Not a Novel Novel.,"I really wanted to like this book. To my surprise it took me three attempts to finish, I was that bored. I tried to give it yet another chance by listening to the audio version, but the result was sadly the same: I found little in terms of the characters, their shared experiences during China's cultural revolution and the author's message on the transcendent power of literature that was new or refreshing."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Destroys many of the great ideas set forth in the first installment. Definitely a ""Don't watch"", both from a philosophical and from an Entertainment point of view."
2,wow,i bought this DVD not knowing anything about it but just on the recommendation of a friend. i really good movie along the lines of reservoir dogs.
2,GREAT DEAL!!!,"The Samsung television that I purchased has a great picture quality, sound, and just an overall great quality that you would expect of a flat panel television. I HIGHLY recommend this or any Samsung flat panel HDTV.PS...My XBOX360 looks sexy as ever now!!! I could never go back to a non-HDTV after this experience."
2,Very typical work from Hawtin et al.,"A good Richie Hawtin record is like a good Cocteau Twins record. You basically know what you're getting into. Both surprises and disappointments are rare. If his music is what you like, you'll like this. Trippy, minimalist techno grooves that move both minds and booties. I think I must have 3 or 4 copies of ""Loop,"" his collaboration with LFO (Low Frequency Oscillation), on various comps, but hey, it does stand up to repeated listening. If an introduction to this style is what you want, I'd recommend Hawtin's import comp ""Selections"" to start, and this to dig deeper."
2,jack pot!!,"i didn't know how i would remove the scuff marks from the rim of my bathtub and the stains in my tub. i tried everything. so when someone from my job mentioned this product, i thought i'd give it a try. it works.....i am very pelased. will order this product again and again. thanks"
2,surprised,I had heard about how the movie displays how our healthcare system takes advantage of individuals that don't have healthcare. I was surprised to see this. It was very informative.
1,Do not even think of buying this piece ?hit!,"It won't work. All of my video players in my computer were crashed. The included stupid software did not even recognize its hardware. The ADS website does not have this produce information because it has been discontinued. There was no single line of description of this ?hit.That is why it was so cheap. I am totally disappointed by AMAZON. I never ever buy from AMAZON, because returning procedure sucks.I am going to hit this product with my hammer, and going to frys."
2,O Magazine Ad Rich,"Like any popular magazine, O has lots of ads in it. Still I am glad I subscribed. I need to bring it to work and enter the code on that contest to see if I won anything. I'd love to meet Oprah someday but I'd be afraid to be on her show. I would like to see some caricatures of her regularly featured in her magazine. I'm a new subscriber, maybe they already had some I never saw. -Beth Hebert, Lake Charles, LA BIGDRAWS DOT COM"
1,Painfully bad,"I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, ""secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge"".The military uses the term ""blivet"" to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie."
1,It's a hard DVD to review,"Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted. So what did he do? He went autobiographical. A fine cast of four, headlined by Marcello Mastroianni, drive from France to Portugal in search of one man's past. Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film. But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice. Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about? Beginnings and endings. What we remember, what we forget. Family relationships gone bad. Atonement. Unflinching realism. In that, it is brilliant. But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know. So I respect it but I don't recommend it. Does that make any sense?"
1,very poor sound quality,"The sound quality is extremely disappointing compared to the old JVC micro system it's replacing.(sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.)"
1,Mostly Christian BS,"I enjoyed the beginning of this book very much since I am submitting my will to that of God as I understand Her. But then the book degenerated into the kind of Christian BS that it took me years to get out of my mind. I usually have great respect for books but this one offended me so much that I destroyed it. If you're not blinded by Christianity, then avoid this book."
1,They stick it to you with impossible-to-open bottle.,"I spent a full hour twisting the cap every which way and still have been unable to open it. There are no instructions for opening anywhere on the bottle or cardboard packaging. Who cares how strong the glue is inside if you can't ever get to it? ADDED NOTE: With many months having elasped since I originally posted this review, I see that this and the one other highly critical review were both marked ""unhelpful."" Could it be that employees of the manufacturer give negative reviews a low ranking? It seems hard to believe that so many people would find it unhelpful to be warned that a glue product might arrive with the cap stuck closed, rendering the product useless. Granted, I might have received one faulty container -- an exception to the other ones that open with no problem -- but, well, I'm just saying . . ."
2,Great,I am very please with the purchase of the Baltimore Ravens Team Pole Flag. The flag is very well made and is a great addition to our yard!
2,Editing would have produced a great mystery!,"Why didn't an editor cut most of the first 100+ pages? We mystery readers already grasp the efforts inherent in starting the search. Also, I agree with others' comments that the humor isn't as prevalent as in the earlier Kinsey Milhone mysteries. Too, I was disappointed by the ending, which required a few more pages to resolve the mystery. However, Sue Grafton can write, and I wouldn't miss reading any of her mysteries!"
2,Awsome glasses!!!,"I bought these glasses (along with the Waring Pro ice crusher) for my wife's birthday after she told me ,while we were at a Stewart's Rootbeer stand, how as a child she and her family had an ice crusher and how she loves frosted mugs. So, I looked around online and found these glasses. They're really great. There isn't an annoying seam (like I've read on other mug reviews) and they're nice and thick. They arrived in perfect condition with no chips or cracks. And, you can't beat the price. I highly recomend them. These glasses(frosted) + crushed ice + Sterwart's rootbeer = total happiness!"
1,Piece of garbage,"These people have a warranty for 60 days. There is no phone number and no customer service whatsoever. They will not respond to your emails.That being said, I have purchased 2 of these, the cloth is SHREDDING BY ITSELF. I purchased them 7 months ago, and they are literally just falling apart. After 3 months, the color completely faded, after 7 months, the material simply started shredding. This is a horrible waste of money, looks great for 3 months, and after that, you might as well flush $200 down the toilet."
2,just as good as almost here,"when i first got the almost here album, all the songs sounded the same. Then when i played it a few times and got used to the songs, i loved it. It still is one of my favorite cds. Then Santi came out. I got it and listened to it, and yet again, all the songs sounded similar. i then listened to it more often, and now i like it almost as much as their first. please dont let your first opinion judge the album! it rocks!"
1,Don't waste your money,This is the worst workout tape i have ever laid eyes upon. The instructor goes way too fast and doesn't give info on how to do the steps. What he does best is moves his hips as shown in the warm up and cool down. It made me wonder if i was watching an exercise tape or a porno. The only person who benefits from the tape is M.C. Cash. His dancers are tired out and the viewer is too confused to actually do anything but watch them. This video is not worth 2.00. I beg you please do not waste your money on this sorry excuse of a workout video.
1,nervous because of news of fakes,"I've bought this before at an Ulta and was excited that it was cheaper here. although the product smells correct and has a similar texture, it doesn't quite seem to be the color I remember. when I opened the package it seemed like perhaps the product had been opened, as the lid had product in the grooves despite the inside ""seal"" that comes with the product. I will betaking this home with me this weekend to compare it to the real thing-- until then it WILL NOT touch my hair.I simply don't trust it yet. I'll try to figure out how to update this review when I compare the two."
2,was not fond of the dancing,Parts of the book took me back to my early years and junior high school dances... not what I want to read about in a SciFi book. Other than that I enjoyed the story.
2,Great speakers for the price,"Plenty of mounting options. These sound crisp and clean. Good response on the mids. The his are clear. The innovative +3db button and directional tweeter are very useful for getting the right amount of hi where you want it. I don't get much bass from these (even considering they are 6.5""), but what bass response I do get is pretty tight. Others reviewers report decent bass, so it may be that I'm not pushing only 22 RMS each @ 4 ohms. Doesn't bother me though, as I've got a subwoofer for all my bass needs. I've already recommended them to a couple friends."
1,terrible charger,"we only used this once then it won't charge anymore. we called customer service, was told charger is out of stock, have to wait for several weeks. now we have to find lawn mowing service which is not easy to find where we are at."
2,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Before I had seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" I had never seen any sort of martial arts movie and had only seen one film in a foreign lanugage with the original language spoken and subtitles. However, this film was so intreguing that I felt immediately absorbed.This film has an excellent plot line for an action movie. There is plenty of fight, but not too much. There is a coming of age element, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the story. Lastly the matter of love is disscussed and attended two in two diffrent veins, but does not overpowere any other part or element of the story. The ending was slightly disapointing, but the middle made up for it.Some people are bothered by the flying in the fight sceens. Yes, if you are a purist, then it is most likely going to bother you. However, the choreography of the fighting, again, is very powerful and allows the viewer to ignore the slight, fantastic moments of flying.Overal, great movie."
2,"His best? No, but certainly important.","The music's good, not great, and is a portrait of the artist as a young man, at first with his high school friend Violet Santangelo and later on his own, recording demos for others. (The Motorcycle Abilene's ""Ride So High"" is worth the price of admission alone.)Realize this- most (if not all) of this was recorded before Zevon was 22. How great can he be expected to be? He's good, if I want to hear his greatness, I'll put on ""Life'll Kill Ya"", ""Transverse City"" or ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" (or any album for that matter released between 1976 and 2003).I'm not sure about the importance of the last two Zevon-free numbers, as I'm sure nobody who buys this buys it for Violet Santangelo, even if she harmonizes beautifully with Warren. But the twelve tracks with the Excitable Boy are essential for tracing his history."
1,Where's all the Spanish Music?,"Are you guys kidding me? Half of the movie's soundtrack is missing! ""Mi Gente"" by Hector Lavoe, ""Che Che Cole"" by Willie Colon, ""Muneca"" by Eddie Palmieri, ""Vieja Luna"" by Celia Cruz & Johnny Pacheco, ""Abuelita"" by Willie Colon & Hector Lavoe, ""Alma con Alma"" by Ray Barretto & Adalberto Santiago, ""El Todopoderoso"" by Hector Lavoe and the best song of the whole freaking movie: ""Para los Rumberos"" by Tito Puente. What happened? Whose pockets were not lined, who wasn't paid off? This soundtrack offering is a joke! Get the Mambo Kings soundtrack, if you want good latin stuff. They are lucky I gave them 1 star. I couldn't give this less."
1,so-so quality,"Compared to other #5 padded envelopes I have purchased, these are of so-so quality. For this batch, the bubbles in the back top middle part of the envelopes are almost always flat."
2,Good Switch with circut breaker attached,Needed a headlite switch for a buggy project and this one worked great. Nice to have the circut protection already mounted.
1,Too much of a good thing,"I was quite dissapointed in this book, particularly given the hype and the other reviews. While the introduction was well done, I thought a surprising number of the recipes were mayonnaise-based, and that the portions were all over the place. In one recipe, two -2lb pork tenderloins (no waste) feed four people (pg. 144) as does 2 lbs. of ground beef (again no waste; pg. 156) yet in another, two 1 lb. bone-in T-bone steaks feed six people (lots of waste). That seems off. What also seems off are the calories. I noticed that on several of the recipes, by the time you end up figuring in calories for fat and various other caloric ingredients (e.g. avocado, cheese, nuts), you're close to the nutritional analysis calories before you even add the meat (e.g. pgs. 166/67 & 130/31).I guess it's just not my thing!"
2,The Original Mother Goose,"This book is in fantastic condition. It has the same pictures from my Mother Goose book that I had when I was a child, and that was many years ago. I'm sure the people this book is intended for will have a wonderful time reading it to their children."
1,Stuck with Brother's Ink too,"if you print a lot and try to save ink expense, do not buy this one. I could not refill it with low-cost-bottled ink; I have to buy the expensive original Brother ink which runs out quick."
1,"Great Content, Too Bad It's Unreadable!","Alton Brown's my favorite cooking expert, and his wit is evident...if you can read it. This bood was designed, apparently, as a high-school project: Multiple pastels, reversed out recipe text in teentsy fonts, and a lousy text-size/leading ratio makes this book very hard to read. I'll never get as much benefit out of it as I could have, had not a rand amateur gotten ahold of the page layout. The book is a solid 5 stars; the design and layout are 0 stars, which renders it a waste of money to me."
2,Ever wonder....,Where some sitcoms shows you watch today get their ideas? Watch this show. The stars as well as the supporting cast give lessons on how to be funny!!!!!
1,This one should have been left in the freezer!,"I like Linda Blair,I must admit that was my reason for picking it up,but I'm sorry I did.I'll give you a run through the good and badThe good is that Linda Blair is in it;thats it for the good!The bad is that Blair is only on screen for about 15 minutes!More of the bad;Cheap camera,bad lighting,cheap sets,cheap audio.Almost seems like it was made for T.V. (which isn't a bad thing if the movie is entertaining,which is not the case here!)The zombies are too few and far in between.Zombies are on screen for 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FX were extremely poor!Boring as hell!Bad acting!Unfunny!Waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A BLACK ANDY MILONAKIS!!!,"Puffy is the worst rapper ever! Correction: Puffy's ghostwriters are the worst ghostwriters ever! Puffy's delivery is deadly dull and the beats ruin every timeless classic he sampled. It's true that other producers sample beats but the difference is that they make you appreciate those classics Puffy makes you hate those classics. Standout Tracks: Every song featuring Biggie might have been a standout track if puffy wasnt on them! Filler: Pain, Cant nobody hold me down, Friend, Is this the end, Been around the world, Dont stop what youre doing and the rest of the album! Puffy is where hip hop went wrong so unless you are ready to hold him responsible for his actions(opening up the door for hip pop icons) dont bash jafool into oblivion for participating in hip hop's destruction!"
1,Made in China,"Don't be fooled by the photo of this item, in which the compass is stamped ""made in USA"". This is a made in China pice of junk."
1,There are better games out there,"We bought this game along with the leapster for our daughter last year at Christmas when she was 3 1/2...She loves Dora and she really tried with this game, but the only thing she would really play was the rabbit jumping on the letters and after awhile it would get too hard for her. I certainly don't think they made this game easy enough or enjoyable enough. If your child really likes Dora and Diego, I would suggest the Diego game. Not only is it eaiser to understand, the graphics are better and it's a lot more fun. My daughter has played the Diego game more in the few weeks we've had it than she has with this game."
2,The Perfect Holiday,"I was really excited to see this movie, not only because of the star power involved, but also because it is a Christmas movie. It's a ok movie."
1,Unhappy,The product did what it was supposed to however one of the terminals broke when I tried to tighten it on first install with minimal pressure. It's pretty much good for a paper weight now.
2,Spectacular book!!!,"I learned so much from this book! And I have gone to college and studied homeopathy extensively for a whole year before. But this book is so beautifully written that it is easy to understand the subject and follow the suggestions. It has GREATLY helped my cat and me, his guardian. A big thank you to the author!"
2,Excellent Product,"I bought this product to create DVD movies from my SONY Camcorder and I love it. It is an excellent product, easy to install and comes bundled with Nero.FK"
2,The Silent World,This is an outstanding book. Bernard E. Branson is an author whose genuine sensitivity to deaf is quite apparent.
2,This album rocks!!!!!!!,"This album is awesome. Sully's vocals are a lot stronger than before. The guitars and drums sound heavier than before. I liked how the CD came with an enhanced portion which had a little menu that had the songs and when you click on them it gives the lyrics, picture, and a video clip of them talking about the album. Each song has its own clip. I just wish that it would have included the music video ""Awake"" in the enhanced portion, but the CD is still cool though."
2,Not bad,"I also thought the story ended rather abruptly, almost noir-like. The ending, while cute, wasn't as satisfying as I was beginning to anticipate, thus a 4 star rating. Otherwise, the film does build interest as it goes, smouldering in the beginning but aquiring clarity and sense of direction as it continues - only to break off suddenly as you find your interest engaged. Either way, it is still a good, if short film at 92 minutes, with a subtle sense of humour and a recognizable cast who put in fine understated performances."
2,Great!,I had a hard time finding a plastic container with buckles that were this dimension. They stack nicely when full and also stack nested when you have a few not in use. However there was a strong chemical smell when first opened - I would recommend airing these out before storing and closing the lid on them.
1,home defence pastry traps,"I thought the product would work better then it did,the attracter did not seem to attract much of anything,I ended useing a spray to get rid of the pantry bugs I would not recommend this product"
2,Two stories in one...,"I really enjoyed this book. Once you begin to read it, most likely you won't want to put it down. The author begins by telling stories of two different people, Porter Washington and Winona Fairchild, with completely different lives but with similar issues. They are both in a major transition period in their lives; most of their battles were internal and somehow the author was able to make them entertaining. By fate, they were able to meet up and the story picked up even more steam. After I read it, I was convinced either the Ms. Robinson knows people such as the ones in the book, or she has the greatest imagination I have ever seen. This is a book where you will make yourself read it from beginning to end just from there being so many twists and turns. So far, I've read two of her books and they have both been top-notch with me."
1,Get stand replaced,"I have the same problem with the stand and called Samsung customer support. They are sending me a replacement stand at no cost. How many are being sold with the old defective style stand? Is the replacement stand an improvement over the old one? The monitor itself is great and so is the price but this stand problem reminds me of ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Hate this radio - don't buy,"I bought this radio two months ago. Already the volume dial is not working. I paid $7 for shipping the first time, now I have to pay to ship it back to Coby and then pay another $6 to have them ship it back to me. All for an $8 radio.Very cheap material used, low quality."
1,Gross!,"Ewww! Barbie and My Scene is soo much more apropriate! Like, come on! You don't have to dress so gross to go on a ""Secret Date""!!"
1,Unpredictable.,Collar sprays dog even when dog is not barking. It is very confusing as he gets randomly blasted in the face with citronella. Collar is easy to refill and simple to use just wish it was more predictable. I ordered the multivet which has better reviews but this is the collar I received.
2,Wonderful book. I would highly recommend it.,Father Richard John Neuhaus of First Things Magazine recommended this book. For that I am truly thankful. I am only about a third of the way through it but am enjoying it immensely.
2,The Royal Road to Card Magic,"If you are looking for the easy and no effort method to card magic, this is definately not the book for you. HOWEVER, in conjuction with the DVD set with the same title, then, with a little to a lot of effort, you will be turning out card tricks that will sometimes amaze yourself, even while you are doing them!By itself, the book's graphics are somewhat difficult to discern. But careful reading of the text resolves most of these issues.Again, what makes this book so very good is the DVD. They enhance each other so that understanding each process is very easy.Good Luck."
1,Not the Frisbee i wanted,I wanted the biggest Wham-O frisbee they make. 200+ grams. The problem is the new Wham-o frisbees are made with a really hard plastic that is very hard on your hands. The image on the site was the older soft plastic model i wanted to buy.i instead got the newer hard plastic model i did not want. Will shop this item on EBay and get what i pay for.
1,No new tale to tell,"Probably the worst romance novel I've ever read. Could have used a little more ""frenetic humor"" and not so much of the ""stark sadness"" anyhow. And the hero doesn't even get laid!"
1,I just didn't think that it presented anything new...,"This book really left me wanting something more, from the book that is. It was well written, but the material was just the same old advice I've been hearing from my friends and family for years. Also, I don't feel that the book does a good job of addressing the dating scence outside of major metro areas where I think that dating is more difficult."
1,Awful music,"Terrible lyrics, primitive music, poor taste. What happened to good old Russian Rock? Those who like this album just haven't heard any better of the Russian music. People, please, look at what you are listening--admitting to liking this music is like admitting to vulgar, unrefined taste."
1,Horrible!!,Bought this filter to clean approximately 25 gallons and it stopped working in 12 hours. The draw is horrible and it is very loud. Save your money!!!!!
2,AWESOME RUSH CONCERT,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR RUSH TO MAKE A LIVE CONCERT DVD,FINALLY AFTER WATCHING RUSH IN RIO,I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.GEDDY ALEX AND NEIL WERE RIGHT ON KEY, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN I EVER HEARD THEM BEFORE.I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CROUD OF 60,000 PEOPLE THAT WERE SO MUCH INTO THE MUSIC AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS FOCUSED ON THE BAND.IN MY OPINION RUSH IS SIMPLY AWESOME,GEDDY'S VOICE WAS BETTER THAN EVER,HIS BASS RUNS WERE FLAWLESS,ALEX'S SPACEY GUITAR RIFFS WERE FANTASTIC AND I COULD FEEL THE POWER OF NEIL'S DRUMS WITH EVERY BEAT.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUSH IN RIO.... JTF"
1,Professor White is upset,"This isn't my review. I heard Professor David Allen White, Shakespeare professor extraordinaire at the U. S. Naval Academy, last night on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. He was furious upon receiving the latest edition of this book to find that all of the notes and introduction have been larded with post-modernist criticism and political correctness. He says he can't teach from this book any more. He cites such nonsense as claiming that Amelia is the true heroine of Othello; As You Like It is about homoeroticism; yadda yadda yadda.He said that if Shakespeare were handed this book, he'd burn it.This review may not get published, so I have tried to contact the good Professor to post his own."
2,Underrated,"This is one of my favorite Newman albums. Mr. Sardonic is at his best here, from the album cover(a comment on the success of Little Criminals), to the very last song. Favs include The story of a rock and roll band(a tribute to ELO)Pretty Boys, William Brown, and Half a Man. Extremely under-rated, it's a must have for fans of Randy Newman."
1,"beware, its not a novel","this book came up as suggested reading after I had read William Fortschen's One Second After, so because I liked that, I gave this a try. Should've saved my money...First of all, there really isnt any story, the characters are so weak, so you cant call this a novel. Its so didactic, there isnt any build up of tension or excitement that would lead me to want to prepare for something, all it does is put me to sleep. The whole thing reads like : Oh, Jesus likes Swiss knives for skinning because they are the sharpest, and Joseph carries a revolver because that can easily be concealed, and Mary can transfuse blood and sew stitches in wounds"" and proceeds to tell you in several excruciating pages how she does it. Its just how it read to me, I had to put it down , couldnt finish it at allIf I wanted an instructional book on survival, I would have bought one. I wanted a novel that actually told a story"
1,Disgusting.....,"This book is horrendous! Developmentally speaking, babies need to eat more than 4 times per day, this includes night feedings. Expecting your baby to suffer just so you can get some sleep is purely selfish. You shouldn't have had a baby in the first place if sleep is SOOOOO important to you that you'd be a neglectful parent. Sleeping through the night isn't worth putting your baby through this misery!Read some REAL books that don't glorify child abuse and neglect. This is dangerous advice to follow and I certainly wish I could have rated this with zero stars!"
2,Super guidance for Parents of Pre Teens,This book came recommended from our Elementary school counselor. I thought the book had very pertinent information for a parent entering unchartered territory with a pre-teen child. The book offers detailed info for each year so you need to put it in a safe place and reference back each year as a refresher. I think I will read this book again and again!
1,Derivative with subtle homophobia,"It isn't even that much of the elements have been done before by better writers. Or that the few original ideas don't logically track. It's that the author runs a subtle but nonetheless disturbing homophobia through all three novels.(Every time there's any hint whatsoever of some ambiguous character, this person is always repugnant) And yet she seems to have no problems whatsoever with rampant incest. Disturbing."
2,Excellent DVD Player,I am very happy with this DVD player. The pictures that I get on my Westinghouse LVM 42w2 with this DVD player are great. The difference is very noticeable with older movies that are upconverted. I highly recommend this player. I had my father buy one also.
1,Big Disappointment,I was very disappointed by this rice. I paid a lot of money per pound and it tasted like any regular parboiled rice. Also the rice was from Argentina and not Italy. It tastes nothing like the creamy rissotto rice from Italy. I do not recommend this rice to anybody.
1,Defective,I opened up the package and one of the rings fell out. After looking at the tarp I found that one of the rings was ripped off. Poor quality control.I now wish I had opened the package sooner so that I could have gotten a replacement for it. My own fault obviously (Lesson learned).I do not think I would buy another one from this maker.I took a spare rope and ran it through all the remaining rings and am using it to cover my log rack. Now I just need to find a higher quality one to replace what this one was to be used for.
2,Great projects!,Lots of easy to do projects. Most of the projects can be adapted to suit your own decorating style.
2,sorry.....,"This is the REAL last thing, ""There's A Lifting"" is a beautiful worship track with great musicianship. C ya"
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,"Extremely P'd Off!!! I ordered these on Friday Feb. 10th. and got suckered into subscribing to Amazon Prime with the expectation of having 2 Day delivery.(I wanted these by Feb. 14th)So my Fiance was waiting by the door like a puppy for a week! Finally got these Sh***y diamonds on Feb.17th.Now my expectations were not too high considering the price.But, I was hoping they would at least look like eachother.One was noticeably bigger and cloudy,with what appears to be black sand throughout.The other was smaller ,more yellow with a big piece of ""black sand"" toward the bottom.These do not shine at all! I wouldn""t let my dog wear these!Not even worth the box they came in!I'll be sending these back,cancelling my Prime account,and visiting Overstock a little more!Amazon you suck!"
1,LESS than 1 star,"Absolutely horrible taste. It tastes like chemicals. No idea how this got so many good reviews, unless these people are putting a lot of bananas, ice cream, or other things into their protein shake. I mix mine with milk or water, and this is the worst protein I've ever tasted."
1,Bad Product,"Has a really Bad Odor. And my Little Toys often get lost while using this. The pump is also alittle too loose. Needs to be a warming gel so that it can be applied to cold areas and then heat up. Is that a summer sausage in my pocket, or am I happy to see you?"
2,good compilation,"This book is well organized, and gives a lot of pratical exercises very usefull for those who works with the frail erderly, but i didn't found anything new in it. On that matter,i was a litle bit disapointed"
1,okay,"Hmmm...what to say indeed. Well, this could be an OK story if, you know, it was a short story. Basically not much happens and a lot of the story describes the land and how Levin is so wonderful and devoted to his wife. Some whould say that this is superb literary thechnique, I say that if you are publishing a novel, let it have a story line. Anna's hardly even in the story anyway. Most would argue that Levin (the goodie two shoes) is the protagonist because he represents Tolstoy's view of Russia."
1,no rating - really cheap chinese product,"i ordered 2 of these after having a similar kind but of a better quality made in Italy. Both did not have the spill proof valve that is usually on the other end of the shut-off clamp and the liquid just leaks. What in the world are they selling incomplete/mal-functioned products. I have not been able to use mine since I got it a few months back. So annoying and a waste of money.I will not even give this a 1 star, basically it is off the rating list."
2,nice phone for the price,"This is really a well functioning phone, nice and clear both ways, and I was able to give my son the other phone for his room upstairs; my only issue is that we mounted it where the other kitchen phone was on the wall, which was flat against the wall and caller ID was easily visible. This phone wall mounts at about a 45 degree angle, just drops into the cradle (careful not to knock it out), and is hard for my shorter wife to see the caller ID screen. However, it does announce the caller with a voice, pretty amazing technology...overall a good deal."
1,"Useless, terrible service from Panasonic","The phone makes in intermitent clicking noise, as if someone has picked up another line. While talking on the handset, all of a sudden you can hear an echoe and can barely hear the person you're talking to. I took it back to Panasonic for repair, they replaced the PCI board, but the phone is still doing the same thing. I took it back again, and they said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm very disappointed with Panasonic. I've had 2 Panasonic 900 MHZ phone and they are fine. This one is useless. Panasonic quality and service has gone downhill. The 30 day refund period has ended and I'll be stuck with a useless phone. I'll have to spend more to buy another working phone."
1,Problem child,"I have another Sennheiser corded stereo headset. Great headset HD450II. This headset will not stay on my head unless I am froze in my seat. I know Sennheiser can do better than this headset. Great sound easy to use, great way to charge the headset, just that the headset is not what I thought it would be. I have considered returning for a refund! So far I have not done so!"
2,Wow!,"I purchased this because it was the least expensive and I just couldn't see spending $150 on a Green Machine (or thousands on new carpet...). I have a one year old and a nervous cat and my carpet is a mess. I read tons of reviews and saw people complaining about difficulty getting the tanks off. I had NO problems with this machine and just removed several stains from my light beige carpet including a coffee stain from a week ago, cat hairball stains and random food that my daughter flings around. This is a GREAT deal!"
1,Doesn`t work,Don`t waste your money. This doesn`t work.The product description said it was for my phone. However It doesn`t charge my phone at all.
2,Best book I've read,This is one of the best books I've ever read out of all the books I've read. It's even better than the Hunger Games in my opinion.
1,"Fantastic Idea, but Poor Plot","I don't know how Universal hurt a movie that had such a great idea, but couldn't produce it correctly. It is hard to screw up this story. You have a story about a secret society, one of the most powerful in the world, and instead of developing that plot, it looked as though this was a skit on Saturday Night Live making fun of the story itself. The acting was particularly poor and it was hard to have a strong level of empathy with any of the characters. Not one stands out. All the characters appear shady, dark, depressing, and yet, it is quite clear that not all of the characters deserved this trait. We didn't really learn that much about the secret society (other than it likes to keep secrets) and the school the students were attending. Where is it? Yale, I presume; but there is little discussion on what the students are like who aren't in the secret society. I think this movie could have been done much better."
2,Plumeri's Tchaikovsky is a treasure...breathtaking in beauty!,"Plumeri's Tchaikovsky is a treasure...breathtaking in beauty, masterful conducting, and the quality of recording is superb! It's brought me back to my best moments of listening & feeling through classical music while renewing my appreciation of Symphonies 4, 5, 6 in a new light. I highly recommend this 2-CD release."
1,Needs expert peer review,"Be carefull relying on only this book for studying, I have found errors both factual and typing in mainly (but not limited to) the Review Questions sections."
2,A Beautiful Story in the Voice of A Wise Child,"This both nostalgic and timeless story of a young girl on the threshold of adolescence ""hooked"" me by page 11 when she tries to make sense out of adult behavior, particularly her mother's attitude about ""right"" and ""wrong"". Remembering this time of watching grownups for guidance but still wanting to figure things out on one's own, I found her insights and reactions very ""on the mark"". What I will remember most about this excellent little book, is the attempt to make sense of all the types of ""Religions"" and beliefs she encounters. The peak, the highlight for me came on pages 187-188 with a serendipitous, mystical moment that gave me chills. I liked the ""afterwords"" and her conclusions about the Meaning of Life"""
1,The mix was wack!!!,"I have the video. It wasn't as good as I heard it was. Some videos are missing on the video like ""True To The Game"", ""Live & Die In LA"", ""Guy In Yellow"", ""Ready or Not."" The sound was low on some videos and the videos are taped in low quality. It has low volume the whole way. The videos are so incomplete. It is more of a puffy video than ice cube. Ice cube's videos bearly last like 30 seconds before they get cut off by Puffy's Full version. I think it is a a waste of money"
1,Delicate head phones,I was perfectly happy with these for about 2 months then the right side of the headphone broke. I taped it back together and a week later the left side broke. Now I am not rough on these head phones as I only listen to them when I'm sitting still on my computer. The sound quality was good but what good is the sound if they break. The construction of the pivot arms is very thin and cheap. Don't buy these they are not worth the money.
2,Excellent single-disc overview of an old country hitmaker,"Texas-born Billy Walker started recording in the late 1940s, but took several years before he made a dent in the charts. This disc collects his big hits for Columbia Records, including his biggest hit, ""Charlie's Shoes,"" from 1961 and followups such as ""Cross The Brazos At Waco,"" which was a western-themed tune, ala Marty Robbins. Walker was a poppy crooner very much in the Marty Robbins style; fans of rough-edged honkytonk will only find a few tunes here to get their toes a-tapping, although countrypolitan aficianados and Walker's oldtime fans will be cheered to see this classic material back in print again. (The other option is to pick up Bear Family's collosal 6-disc box set, which covers the same years, but this sampling is probably enough to satisfy most folks' curiousity...)"
1,The second book was much better,"I read first El Reino del Dragon de Oro and I like that book very much, then I read this one and the first part is very good, but the second half of the book is just boring, when Alex and Nadia went with the natives and they want to make you feel that they live better than any civilization is just pathetic, and I won't tell anything about the ""invisible Nadia"" the last 100 pages could be written in 50 or less pages. If I read first this book I would never read the second one."
2,LOVE IT!!,Had one - lost it - thought I'd die.....looked everywhere and finally found it here....no one who uses garlic in cooking should be without this litttle gadget.
2,For all of us,"An excellent lesson in faith, tolerance, and trust in God - things that may not give instant reward, but provide long term grace."
2,A book for everyone!,"A wonderful and extensive collection, on a wealth of topics relating to personal nutrition, and fitness. What I liked most about this book, is the wonderful layout, it has diagrams, pictures, boarders, and so much more! Dr. Baugh has obviously done extensive research into sports nutrition, and this is a book EVERYONE should have. There is nothing being sold, no off the wall ideas, Its just a book of information that can help even the most seasoned body builder.A Wonderful book, superbly written, and easy to understand."
1,Bad acting and a silly script,"Bad acting and a silly script are only two of the problems with this film. It's hard to convert a comic book hero to the big screen, and for every one that succeeds (Spiderman, X-men, Batman) there are two or more that fail (Green Lantern, Green Hornet, Thor, Captain America, Fantastic Four, the Hulk) and that's especially true when the comic character is complex (Ghost Rider).Bottom line - this film will appeal only to the most hard core comic book fans, and even some of them might be disappointed."
1,Terrible sound quality.,I use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations. Until now I've been very happy with many different Motorola and Midland models. The FV-700 has great features but the sound quality is soooo bad it's virtually unusable. Don't make the same mistake I did.
2,Every parent should read this to their child!!,"This book is incredible. It is a sweet, enduring, adorably illustrated way to remind your child how much you love him/her. I have read this book to my son for years. We both love it... and he's 9! Great for bedtime, cuddle time... anytime!"
2,An Excellent Read,"This is a very entertaining book. It may start out a bit slow but picks up quickly. I ususally read to put myself to sleep, but this one kept me up past my bedtime!"
2,Indiana Jones,"After seeing the new Indiana Jones movie, it made me want to go back and see the originals again. They are as good as I remembered. Also, it was great to watch these DVDs on a big screen with an upconventing DVD player. It was almost like your were at the movies again."
1,Not recommended for MCSE exam,"This book will not help you pass the exam. You may learn good networking stuff, but I'm sure when you buy this book, you are preparing for the exam. MCSE exam covers a lot more than what the book offers."
1,Don't waste you're money,"This is the worst nonstick hard anodized pan I've ever owned. I have an Analon Titanium 8 in. skillet and Calphalon 12 in. hard anodized skillet, which are much better. I've also had Silverstone that's better than this pan. This pan is very tinny and thin, over heats easily on even low-med heat on an electric stove, the handles are thin, the lid is ill-fitting and way too heavy for the weight of the pan, and the metal surrounding the lid is curved inward and hard to get clean. I own a Cuisinart Multiclad Pro stainless set, which is excellent, and I wanted to try this before I spent more on the Multiclad Pro nonstick skillets. I'm really surprised at the low quality. I'm glad I tried it, now I know it's junk. Cuisinart should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on it."
2,great!,Was referred to this book-using all three I ordered for help in understanding the minds and lives of our encarcerated brothers and sisters. I'm in a prison ministry.
2,Weaver 301,"The 301 is a fast and easy base to install. But it's strong, as needed on a Super Blackhawk. After shooting 20 rds. I check to see if shot lose. But it was still sound."
1,Bad show.............!!!!!!!!,"One of the worst WWII movies I've seen. The uniforms were good, it looked as though tha uS troops had M-1's, the acting was class ""B"". Not recommended at all.Bruce"
1,Total lack of detail,"The book constains too little useful information both for newbie and for experienced administrator. The author is running through the different parts without in-depth explanation or practically useful information. The only reasonable part is Chapter 1 which covers HP-UX installation. I bought this book as preparation tool for HP-UX test but it won't work. Also, about 1/2 of the boot itself consists of hardcopy of man pages. Probably this is the most expensive you to print the man pages. Conclusion - don't waste money on this book, use the books from LDP, HP Instant Information CD or buy ""Unix System Administration Handbook"" by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein - the best overview of UNIX and it's flavours I have ever seen."
1,I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky,"I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky.I am happy that author came from and was a member of the Parisian intelligencia and was able to hold discourse with the cream of society. He then was able to afford to go to Nepal to study Tibetan Buddism and supported himself. This took him quite a number of pages to say. By the time he was ready to discuss the book's subject, I was quite depressed and could read no further. This negated the promise and premise of the book for me."
1,Do not adjust your controller....,"My whole family played this game over the christmas holiday.... NONE of us could get the controls to work right while playing the mini-games. Don't waste your money. If you want an interactive family game, do Wii sports or Super Swing Golf or one of the driving games."
2,i'm no expert but...,i was given a copy of this cd (copied from a record) by a friend. unfortunately all i know is that it is a compilation of japanese dj/producers/artists journeys with world music. awesome beats and intriguing vocals add up to an album that is worth every cent that you paid for it... if you are a fan of recordings from the label 'spiritual life' joe causell et al. you are thoroughly in need of this musical adventure. enjoy the arual pleasure that is the 'bananna connection'. full apologies for not being more knowledgable of artists/contributors etc.
2,wonderful vitamins for your immune system,"the vitamins are great, keep you healthy in any weather even when smb sneezes right near you-nothing."
2,Amazing Read,"This book is AMAZING. I litterally could not put it down, and finished it in 4 hours. The story told by Immaculee will bring you to tears as you contemplate the absolute horrors endured by the people of Rwanda. Despite all this, Immaculee tells the story without a trace of bitterness or resentment.Her story of courage and forgiveness is a lesson to us all, and an absoulte MUST READ."
1,Not worth the $s,"Functionally this pasta set is virtually nonfunctional. Does not heat like tri-ply should (30+ minutes on high!), strainer does not sit down near far enough in the pot so water will bubble out all over. Looks pretty, but that is about it, for cooking pasta it is worthless. Spend the extra dollars and get All Clad, you will be thanking me."
2,Gold of the Blue Hummingbird,"Have you ever read a book that keeps you're attention from the start and when you finish the book, you close the book and say, ""Wow, that was a great book"". Well that's what Gold of the Blue Hummingbird is. The author created a great possibilities book through superstition, and not only a plausible but exciting novel in the process."
2,Best Purchase I Have Made in A Long Time!,"I bought the 8 panel. My Cavapoo puppy is 7 pounds. This is perfect for her and would be fine for multiple puppies or a larger dog. I love how the panels easily seperate so I can get in and clean or make smaller, bigger. Plenty room for her crate, puppy pad, bowls, toys, etc. I don't know what I would do without this ! My puppy no longer needs to be locked in her crate if I'm gone for hours. Now she had her own little room which she loves!It is hard to lean over the top to reach in so I open one of the panels to step inside if I need to. I don't want to injure my back! I love that I can step in this way. The doggy door s great. Fast shipping, good quality, looks better than the usual metal pens, love it. Convenient , great buy!"
1,Travesty,"Let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of experimental music--seriously. The Residents are one of my favorite bands of all time.But this mangled, mixed up mess is an absolute travesty. The flavor, essence, and sheer beauty of T Rex/Marc Bolan are completely lost. I suppose I should have realized what a hot mess it would be when I saw the cover, but I'm a big enough Bolan fan to give this a shot."
1,Reason Why Hip-Hop is Dying....,"Let's explore Young Jeezy and ask a few questions.Can Jeezy spit 16 bars that rhyme? NOCan Jeezy distinguish between a verse and a hook? NODoes Jeezy explore other topics other than trapping, pimping, and killing? NOHas Jeezy ever killed anybody? NODoes your little sister or brother rap better than Jeezy? YESCan Jeezy battle with Nas/Jay-Z/Eminem and win? NOCan Jeezy battle a brick an win? NODoes Jeezy provide a negative influence for kids? YESWill Jeezy ever be a legend? NO. There are far better artist in the South."
2,Beautiful WOnderful and moving,"Jerusalem:Center of the world Awesome,,,wish move documentarys were made like this,,I am hoping to visit the Holy Land soon ,,this has really inspired me to go where Jesus lived,, thanks so much"
1,broken cd case,"My cd showed up with a shattered case. Wasnt worth sending it back to correct it, was supposed to be a gift"
2,American Orthodoxy is greatly indebted to Fr. Seraphim,"While so many Orthodox theologians in Fr. Seraphim's day were writing left-leaning works that looked as though they had come from Vatican II, monk Seraphim was earnestly laboring to bequeath to the tiny American Orthodox flock the rich patristic inheritance of the Church.The Soul After Death's chapters upon the tollhouses contains large quotations of St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Macarius of Egypt, St. Leo of Rome, and St. Mark of Ephesus. Those who slander Fr. Seraphim and these teachings are usually from the school of one Mr. Puhalo, who deeply resented Fr. Seraphim's vast influence upon Orthodox Christians of America, Russia, Greece, and elsewhere.Fr. Seraphim was a great luminary of the Orthodox Church who truly struggled for Orthodoxy. You will not be disappointed with this easily readable, insightful volume."
2,The best book about world explorers that you can find.,"Off the Map is a wonderfll book. It is basically a summary of world exploration from Marco Polo in 1271 to Umberto Nobile in 1928. There are separate chapters about each explorer, all arranged in chronological order with each chapter about 10-20 pages each. The chapter lengths are just right in that they are not too long, but also not lacking for detailed information. Each chapter also has a map that illustrates where the particular explorer travelled, which was extremely helpful. There are also 3 separate sections of illustrations and photos which helps give a visual picture of the explorers.Overall, this book is packed with information and is written in such a way that each chapter is told like a story and each story takes you back in time to a different era. If you are intertested in world exploration or world history, then this book is a must read. I enjoyed it very much."
2,A woman's perspective,"Judith Sherman's Say the Name is a survivor's account of a teenage girl's struggle with God and humanity in Ravensbruck concentration camp during the Holocaust. Sherman, now a wife, mother and grandmother living in the United States, writes her memoir some 50 to 60 years after the Nazi's carried out their ""Final Solution.""Sherman's poetry and prose in this book reflect a loss of people, places and things that make up the fabric of a person's life, culture and beliefs. She is, at turns, angry and bewildered. She demands an accounting for these atrocities. But ultimately Sherman's quest for survival and her insistence on remembering the names of women who were killed conveys a sense of humanity and even of hope. This is Sherman's first book, and she is not a polished writer. She writes in fragments and one has the sense of poetry scribbled on napkins over the years and then included in the memoir. Her book is all the stronger for this."
2,WOW!!!! - fresh,"awsome, includes two different styles, ""stimulant DJ's"" and ""superfast OZ"" ....i do not OWN a mix better than this 2 hours of kicking, drum rolling HARD HOUSE....ONE of the best CD's i have ever balsted at a party.....still trying to get a hold of(volume: 1 3 and 4), damn tidy trax had to set up in the UK!!!"
2,I was the perfect person to test this ...,"I was the perfect person to test this product. I have had many UTIs (urinary tract infections) in the past, especially while pregnant. I'm three months pregnant now, and will continue to use these. Pregnancy often masks the symptoms of UTIs and when they go unchecked they can lead to kidney infection and even early labor. These strips were very easy to use, and they worked quickly. I'll probably test myself once a week throughout my pregnancy."
2,It is a easy learning book !,This is a really good book. It presents all the idea so clear with many graphs and figures. That make you feel comfortable to keep on reading. Also the contents are not so hard. It is a really good book for the beginner who want to know more about meteorology.
2,"Grayish color, not silver",Functions well. Just the color looks kind of greenish gray rather than silver as it is showed in the picture. Might ended up spray paint it white for better decor purpose. Overall very satisfied.
1,Best Part,"The best part of this book was the last page, as I knew it was OVER.I have always liked this writer, and her books. We have a 'gaming magazine' here- nothing more- oh- not to forget a murderer who considers shooting over a dozen people near the end.It was wall to wall video games, a murder with a mouse cord, and karate moves, and a buzzard.There were no leaping loons, however-unless you consider the entire cast of this book.If I were a video person, perhaps I would have liked it better. I am happy to say it was a library book~ no money spent here."
2,Great can opener,"Both the service and product are 5 stars! The ease of ordering, delivery, and product quality make me wonder why I ever hop into my car to drive to a store to buy things."
1,Not a miracle worker,This pan doesn't seem to cook crusts any better than any other pizza pan. The holes are rather a pain too between dough cooking into the holes (time intensive clean-up!)and crumbs covering your counter when you cut a crispy crust.
2,"Wow, my back feels AMAZING","I'm a 24 year old male who is fairly active. I run around three miles a day and eat a raw food diet (if you don't know about raw please do yourself a massive favor and google it...it's not raw meat).This yoga transformed my body (especially my back) and mind. I love meditation and even though I don't follow the mantras included in the DVD, I find that after the yoga my body and mind are very clear. This yoga is different than the other yoga that I had been doing (I'm a beginner) so I thought it was weird at first....but wow, the results are amazing. I also didn't think it was that great of a workout the first time I tried it...but I wasn't doing all the exercises correctly.The second time I gave it a try I asked a friend who's fairly experienced with yoga to join me. She ended up being worn out by the end and I realized what an intense workout this DVD actually provides.Check this great DVD out."
2,Many true-to-life scenarios,"I was very entertained by this book--by the genuine feelings and actions of the main character--Joey Becker. Jo's rationalization of her actions and her criticism of those rationalizations was something many female readers can relate to. However, I did find Daniel's character a little too saintly and the daughters a bit too nasty. I was enthralled however with the youngest daughter's explanation for the nastiness in the twins. This book was filled with many experiences that are true to life!"
2,Fairly Odd Parents,"This movie is awesome! Although The Fairly Odd Parents is a children's show, it has plenty of adult humour (think Ren and Stimpy or Spongebob). My friend and I started watching this and laughed for an hour and a half straight. Timmy and his godparents visit spoofs of TV shows such as SpeedRacer, The Simpsons, Batman, and Charlie Brown's Christmas Special. A definite must have for ANY age!"
2,good compliation,"This is an interesting accumulation of anything and everything related to Hell. The book is media based, but I found it informative and not dense, making it easier to get through. I enjoyed the different views on hell from other cultures, relgions, times throughout history. To me this different interpretations or views add to the informative level of this book and provide such a wide variety for people to relate with. I rather enjoyed the prominent media compenent of this book because I think right now the media is increasingly prevalent. I commend the author for taking on such a dense and difficult untagible subject such as hell."
2,This album will become a big part of your life...,"...I guarantee it. I got into Pavement kind of by accident. I ordered this album from my local library just on a whim (I'd listened to Amazon.com samples and was not impressed) to see what if I liked it up close and the real cd. This instantly became one of my fav albums and made Pavement/Malkmus a big part of my life. For me, Pavement is the kind of band you get into ""phases"" for and leave alone for a while. Malkmus' lyrics are cryptic to the point of inscrutable and despite the fact that this guy writes completely indecipherable lyrics for the most part, he still has a huge following, so what does that tell you? I know most Pavement fans consider ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"" to be their best, but I actually prefer this to CR, CR. Every song is amazing and like I said, if you are new to this group and get this album, be prepared to become obsessed and fall in love."
1,I would give this book a zero if possible.,"This book is proof that universities hate their students and only want their money. Boyce needs to take notes from Rogawski on how to write a comprehensible math text/solutions manual. I hope Boyce reads these reviews and realizes how big of a bag he is, but he's probably to busy polishing his only turd and repackaging it so he can continue to exploit students for drug money."
2,Miniature Edition,"The book information is good, but be sure to notice that you are ordering a MINIATURE book. It is about 3"" x 3""."
2,Love it,"I had been searching for a jogging stroller wit a swivel wheel that was easy to push and comfortable for my son. He loves it. Have used it to walk the older children to and from school, in the mall, around the neighborhood ( goes up and down curbs without disturbing the walking pace or passenger.) We are taking it to Disney next week."
1,"A disappointing, very predictable read","If this book has been recommended to you because you have enjoyed books by Earlene Fowler, Jean Hager, and/or Sandra Dallas, forget this one. I found the characters and the plot to be very predictable, and the style reminded me more of what one might find in a Harlequin romance. Very disappointing."
1,Caution! Damages your carpeting,"This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet."
2,Yet another great Jump5 DVD...,"I just got this DVD about an hour ago, and it's great! There are two music videos (God Bless the USA and Spinnin' Around) and interviews with the members of Jump5. I love both the videos...they're both really cool and fun. God Bless the USA is probably my favorite of the two though, because it's such a pretty song and the video's just...awesome.The interviews are my favorite part though, because you get to see how normal they really are, and they seriously seem like people that you would hang out with every day. I highly recommend this DVD to any Jump5 fan that does not already have it. It's a great DVD, and I also recommend the ""All the Time in the World"" DVD."
2,great over all value,"I bought this product for my company, for the drivers to comunicate while doing drop-offs at banks and such. It works perfectly, and at 50 bucks, you can't beat em. My office is located in a 14th floor, and the parking lot is located in the basement of the building, sub level 4. I can still get great reception from my office to the parking lot. I recomend this item for anyone in the market for family/ recreational or work purposes.JorgeSanto Domingo"
1,not good as I thought,"after reading all the reviews, I thought this is a good to buy, after it arrived, I gave it to my son who is 7 month old, but he doesnt like it at all. Then I found out it is too dry for his mouth. I tried it by myself, the taste is ok, no suger taste which is great. It reminds me what I had when I was little back to china. However, I can find the same stuff in a nearby chinese store for much cheaper price. If you have any chinese store nearby, I dont see any reason to have it for this expensive price."
1,Awful,"When I first bought this CD, I was hoping for a greatest hits, like many of the other reviewers it seems. When I popped it into my CD player, I immediately knew that something was up. I scanned through the rest of the songs and couldn't believe what I was hearing...this was not the Bon Jovi that my mom and aunt had introduced me to all those years ago. Needless to say, I got rid of that CD the same day I purchased it.Now, I do applaud BJ for trying out something new with their classics (much like ""Crossroads"" ""Prayer 94""), but it's just not right. If you want to try a new sound, try it out on a new CD; leave your old gems alone.In a nutshell, leave this disaster on the shelf. It almost hurts listening to all of their classics ""sung"" like this."
2,Lights Out,"I feel that Lil' Wayne's second solo project is by far a whole lot better than first one, ""Tha Block Is Hot"". He and the Cash Money Millionaires did an exceptional job on the beats because they truly thump in your CD player. Lil' Wayne raps from the bottom of his heart especially when he pays tribute to his father. If you're like me and you consider yourself a true fan of CMB, go pick up Lil' Wayne's ""Lights Out""."
1,She is ugly and so is her music,this cd is just pathetic@ every song is the same i can'tt even tlell the differnece between them... she screamstoomuch. carrie if you wantt omake a good cd than stop singing slow boring songs
2,This is one of the few styling products ...,This is one of the few styling products that I've found that actually works on my hair. I have permed hair and this gel hasn't made it go flat or make it frizzy. I also like the pump bottle. I recommend this one.
2,GREAT PRODUCT AT GREAT PRICE,THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. IT PROTECTS MY PHONE FROM SCRATCHES.
2,"Unfortunately, much is true in this book","I know many of the individuals mentioned in the book and I'm sorry to say that while there are some exaggerations, I believe the OSU stuff is pretty accurate"
1,Horrible Camera,"My daughter received this camera as a gift. Too bad a gift receipt wasn't included, because I definitely would have returned it on Day 1. The camera constantly freezes, drains its batteries, and the screen resolution is of horrible quality, where you can't even tell what the image is. I did not print any pictures, so I cannot speak to that, but please do not buy this camera. You're better off buying a cheap adult digital camera."
1,Pool Leaf Vac,This is the worst pool leaf vac I have ever purchased. Does not work and broke within the first week. Order a better grade or go to a pool supply to get one. Amazon should take this one off their list.
1,Don't buy this book,"The author is mainly interested in slamming Microsoft and object-oriented programming. Unfortunately, he never gets off this soapbox and gets around to teaching anyone how to write a complete program using VB Express. A complete and disappointing waste of time and money. I will most certainly avoid works by this author in the future."
1,A Boring list of common places,"Page after page, motivational phrases and cites with no structure or development of any kind.Boring, a waste of $$$ and time."
1,WAY FUN. WAY TOO VIOLENT,"THis game is alot of fun. I know what people have said. The graphics are terrible, the control stinks ... blah blah blah. THis game is a lot of fun. Bullet time fast gunning action can't be beat. Unless you have some assemblance of a soul. YOu can not honestly play this and feel like everything is ok. THough I had fun, I felt guilty the entire time I played it. Every single level requires you to bust down a door and begin completely obliterating about 12 people. This can't be good for the soul can it? SO, though it may be tempting. Avoid this one. I can not recommend a game that glorifies so much blood and gore.Bottom Line: Is it Fun? Yep. Will I keep it? You will finish it in about a week. Multiplayer is terrible. Is it for kids? You should be huung if you let your kids play this one. And, what's bad for kids is rarely good for parents."
2,"Great, heavy duty, stitching!","My dog breaks through the stitching of 'squeaker' toys pretty quickly. However the stitching on this product is really good. When the squeaker inevitably died, and I had to replace it, it was actually harder to open than most.I'm removing a star because the squeaker broke. I also wish (the squeaker) was bigger, matching the proportion of the toy better."
2,It's a pretty good book in the series,"According to my 9 year old (who's read the book recently), it's a pretty good book and something she'd like to try someday (staying in a cabin in the snow). As a parent, I've got to say it's nice to still have a few things in life that don't need to be CONSTANTLY monitored for content and to know that this series is one in which good wins out, hard work, persistance, and team work are rewarded, and family is still the most important thing in the world."
2,Make a pot of wedding soup and then read this book!,"Capturing the true essence of what it means to be of Italian-American descent and from Youngstown, Ohio, the author paints a richly moving accout of family life during the first half of the twentieth century. Through laughter and tears, I read about Jo, the protagonist whose faith and strenghth never fail. This ""universal"" story played out in many of the homes on Rose Street or on Dearborn Street where my family history began. We learn from Jo and from our grandparents that the struggle to preserve our family and its heritage provides riches a banker can never count. Their experiences so move and inspire us to hold dear all that is truly important: love, loyalty and a true committment to family."
2,Hip Hop In A Class Of Its Own,"I am not much of a fan of hip hop in of itself. However, when I heard a few samples I thought I would give this one a try. After wearing this CD into the ground and ""The Standard"" I am ready for another release. Psyche Origami is a solid blend of hip hop and electronica (with a little house and acid jazz mix). It keeps a solid beat but has some very soothing sounds that you would expect from artists like Fat Jon. Kudos to Adult Swim for publicizing Psyche Origami."
2,Great banana hanger/ fruit holder,"Love it. Looks good and great design. The banana hanger part is removable so if it's not needed you can remove it. Great to have bananas and other fruits all in one place. Well built and strong does not tip over from weight of bananas even when there's no fruit in the bottom. Worth the price, I have seen similar products in stores not made as well and a lot more pricey."
1,Not that great!,"If you are needing significant humidity. This device will not produce it. I grow mushrooms and was using this device in a mini greenhouse (small). It has been sealed all the way around and has very minimal air leakage. Standing alone the humidity is maintained at 60%. The device did raise it to 70% and would hold but I need at least 80 to 85% humidity. Maybe, I was expecting to much...I don't think so. The item was hyped and failed to produce the results. Plus... you could make this thing yourself with a quick trip to Ace Hardware and about $5.00!"
1,An Unsatistified Customer and have been trying to return for my credit and have emailed 4 times with NO reply...,"The product is not what it looks like on the advertisement and I thought that it was the complete set and not few pieces, they are soooooooo light weighted and I would like to return and my refund as I have been requesting. PLEASE and Thanks"
2,A value recording with a drawback,"A great recording and inexpesnive. The only drawback is that it lacks the ""frill"" of a libretto. So if you want to understand what is being sung in Egyptian, you're out of luck."
2,3 Great stories in one,I really liked this book. The stories of 3 daughters all different with a common tie. Normally I do not enjoy fantasy style stories but the Lady of the Lake was Awesome. Truly an edge of your seat could not put it down book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
1,Crystals in general are NOT the way to go.,"Crystals in general are a poor choice for litter. Clay litter allows clumps to form wherever the cat pees. The clumps are easy to remove. Crystals however do not clump. Thus, the pee-saturated areas are harder to scoop out of the box. Why is it a big deal if pee stays in the litter box? Because cats are very clean animals and prefer to void in pee-free, odor-free zones. If their boxes smells of pee, then, the cats are more likely to start peeing in places other than the box. Do NOT get rid of your cat, because it dislikes using the litter box!!! More often than not, a switch to odor-free, clay litter will cure any litter box avoidance. If you don't want to clean your litter box daily, then, don't get a cat. (I have a beautiful cat that I bought from the pound. I used the crystals with her at first, and she preferred peeing on the carpet. I switched to the clay, clumping litter. Guess what happened? I think you know.)"
2,good movie,this is one of my favorites. just a good movie to watch but isnt anything with morris chestnut in it?:) i recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good story line. i liked all the characters and the way the movie played out. i thought it was really good
1,Could be a lot better,"As a PIC beginner I was hoping for more than this book provides in the first few chapters.As already pointed out the title is very misleading; there certainly aren't 123 ""experiments"". Many of the 123 articles are to do with the ins and outs of programming in C.The typos and other mistakes don't help either and don't fill you with confidence when what you do doesn't reflect what the book says will happen, e.g. experiment 7, p31 where the LEDs I get aren't the same as indicated, and looking at the circuit, you'd never get the LEDs lit as indicated in the book.Sloppy."
2,samsung vga 1000,"i absolutely love this phone! just swithced from verizon to sprint and its way better! color on the phone is exceptional. one reveiwer stated that you cant see the time on the outside LCD w/o opening the flip, this is not the case, simply hold the volume key down for a few seconds and the outside LCD will ight up. the sound and clarity of this phone is awesome.i do agree that the manual is very basic, but the more that i play with the phone the more i am discovering exactly what it can do and it can do alot!! i recomend this phone to anyone. so far so good w/ the battery life. the only thing that i dont care for is when you download ringers, you cant preview them first w/o buying. other than that ...i love my phone!!!!!!"
1,Not what I expected.,These just don't hold up. Too big and too weak. My flower boxes (under the max weight) caused them to bend.
1,it just doesn't work w/Canon XL1 tapes,"i shoot miniDV on a CanonXL1, and this deck just won't play the tapes without introducing artifacts every 45 seconds or so.on the other hand, it makes a great parking block for my Audi, albeit an expensive one.i would NOT buy this product if you aquire images on Canon or Sony cameras, as (by all indications) it'll perform as well as President Bush articulates (ie: it won't)."
2,awesome!,great workout - I am sweating everytime and very sore - but thats good! I just need to be more consistant to see better results.
2,love the scenery created,"The charectors are interesting and I love the images/scenery described. Ive heard it may become a movie which would be great, but I really hope they change the ending if so. Hated the way it ended for the lead."
1,Not Easy To Use,"I just wanted a pouch to hold my leatherman skeletool. I got this one online. It looks good but it is not designed to fit on a belt, which is what I want it for. So I have to say , that it is next to useless. The description provided does not inform buyers that this is not suitable for belt use. Waste of money."
1,Don't buy this product.,This was a waste of money. It leaked sugar water all over the deck and I couldn't even use it. I saw some of the reviews saying it leaked but I wanted to give it a try because I liked the balloon. I should have trusted the reviews. Don't buy this with plans of using it as a humming bird feeder - it leaks like crazy. I'm trying to find a way I can use this as a garden decoration. Very disappointing! Wish I could give it less than one star.
2,"Time tested, rugged, reliable pump","Been using this exact one for twenty years. This, my third, is only a back up. Would still be on the first if I had done some simple upkeep during the dry season. When it's called upon this machine just goes and goes, sometimes for days on end, emptying our basement sump."
1,Betrothal at a Tender Age: 'Twas Nothing New...,"Except that the gentleman was a kidnapper!Lady Lucinda Esmond's swine of a father was forever gleecing young bucks in London's gaming halls - until he met Captain Mark Chamfrey who, having been cheated, promptly kidnapped ten-year-old Luncinda for ransom!But, when Chamfrey thought better of it and returned the girl, Esmond exacted his own price: Chamfrey could save his skin by marrying his little victim nine years hence. Time enough for Chamfrey to inherit a title and fortune.Lucinda's father could not have foreseen what a beauty Lucinda would become. Nor that Chamfrey, a newly made marquess, might welcome the fulfillment of his punishment!"
2,That's the way it should be (done),Booker T and the MGs playing their thang. Have they ever been better?? This is really grovin time - has been on top of my list for years. I am sure they are gonna stay there. Go get it!!
1,Saucony Grid Triumph 3,"I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight. Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line, size twelve and a half. They aren't the same and although the fit is good, they're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead: pricier but considerably better.For God's sake: don't buy runing shoes on-line!"
2,good textbook,"the book is interesting, if you like and enjoy statistics, be my guest. if you are into mastering theory of political analysis, this is also the book for you. The theoretical part of the book, is very interesting, and quite easy to understand, no problems at all. If you have a hard time getting stats, do not worry, still you will be fine with the theoretical part of the book. YOU find a glossary of terms in the back of the book which become very helpful to understand any ""political-statistical"" term, you might be not familiar with."
2,Do Not Read the Editorial Review,"Do not read the above editiorial review if you want to fully appreciate this film, as it gives away the plot. Ed Harris plays an American spy, Gus Lang. He works for both the British and Germans during the period immediately before DDAY. He is sent to Paris where a young but brilliant American officer, one of a handful of allied soldiers who knows the actual DDay plans, has been captured and is being interrogated by the Germans. The Allies direct Lang to prevent the young American from talking. The Germans use Lang to try coercing the American to reveal the Allies DDay plans. The fun of this movie revolves around not knowing Gus Lang's real intentions. Add the fact that one of the German officers involved in the interogation is working for the Allies, but which one? This is a smart, well written script, with strong characters by a fine cast."
2,Put the same old stuff away and pick up something fresh!,You am I is a band made up of 3 ordinary Aussie blokes who know how to make addictive music. Hourly Daily has everything from accoustic ballads to driving guitars. The lyrics are fun with some typical Aussie sarcasm. I recommend you add this to your music collection - you will not regret it.
2,The most terrifying position on the B-17.,"This book will verify all the terrifying elements of the ball turret. It's impossible to imagine hanging in a sphere underneath the B-17, 5 miles up without a parachute, looking flack in the face and sweating at 40 degrees below zero. It even gets worse in a fighter attack when the gunner is moving up, down and around like a barrel going over Niagra Falls."
1,Did not work,"I followed all of the instructions and very carefully added the colored ink to my cartridge, but could never get it working in my printer. I'm very disappointed and had to trash this one and order a new HP cartridge."
1,In my opinion I thought tis book was awful.,"Sorry to say I hated this book alot. Sure it has its thrills, but it was awful. I always look for new books to read. So I decided to look for opinions online and I found this book. Of course the only reason I was looking was because I was bored stiff. I love stories about vampires. The authors I love to read are Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and J. K. Rowling. Its hard enough to wait for their books to come out. So I always look for new books to read. I liked Kerry and Ethan a little I guess. The fact that Vande Velde vampires can be killed by the sun bores me. I prefer the knife in the heart way. All am saying is that I hated this book, but thats my opinion. So don't let my opinion stop you from buy this book."
1,Butcher up the prequels all you want!,The Prequels already reek. Add more CGI to those and release them. Why not release the original Trilogy as the masterpieces they were? I will not be buying this. I am saddened that so many will put up with this nonsense and buy them anyway.
1,There are better... this one is really dated.,"I was tempted into buying this because of a number of positive reviews. I have a few older Austin videos that I enjoy, so don't think that I'm opposed to using those. I'm not. I found myself getting very impatient with Denise, as the warm-up seemed to drag on, and the stretches were very dated. More current videos seem to be so much more effective. The workout itself is longer than many of her tapes, but again, it didn't impress me as being very motivating. I do like her 30 Minute Fat Burning workout(1989), and the Fit and Fat Free(1991) tapes. They're a lighter workout that remind me of the aerobics classes of the late '80s, but are a nice change from the tapes of today."
2,Impeccably written,"I thought better than Men of Bronze. Would have been up in the 5 star range if there had of been a map included to show the various territories & cities. I would rate at 4 1/2 stars. I was unsure of the use of the term Iranians on a couple of occasions. I enjoyed the story,the detail & the descriptions of the battles. Very good"
1,Broken out of the box,"I bought one that was broken out of the box. There was no physical damage, it just would not power on."
1,(...),"(...) This is the most cheapest product I ever bought, It is so cheap it broke a week after i bought it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Garbage!,"I would give this zero stars... but cannot. This product arrived and I installed new batteries and the unit is dead. It's always great to buy a product and have it not work right out of the box. Amazon is great with returns and makes it really easy, the only bright spot with this transaction."
1,Not like the real thing...,These are a little cushion that is comfortable to wear in a loose shoe. They do not do anything else as far as anti-cellutlite effect while wearing. I would not buy again.
1,Found out I couldn't take it,"I watched this thinking I would be able to just sit there and the music replacement would not bother me.I was wrong.By the time I got to Toolie's burial and not having Whiter Shade of Pale there, I had had enough.Maybe if the price is really really low, maybe I can consider getting the rest of this series, but for now I am stopping at Season 3."
2,Very real and close to the heart,"I love Nicholas Sparks and he definitely did a wonderful job when writing this story. There were so many times that I thought ""wow, thats exactly how i felt when my husband was still in the army""...I recommend this to any young women with husbands in the army or anyone who enjoys a good romance novel."
2,Good book,Great read. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in history. It will definitely keep you engaged and is a good source of knowledge.
2,"awesome ""the original death metal band""","this is a classic,if you are a death metal fan ,find out were the roots are."
1,Defective,This worked very well for the first 2 weeks. Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers. I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars.
2,Another good mystery,"If you like Anthony Hopkins & like to solve mysteries, then this is for you. The pace wasn't always as fast as i generally like, but once into the story line, it was intriguing."
2,You will not be deceived by this version.,"Carmen is one of the most popular and performed operas, so not just any performance can be put on screen. I liked this version. It is well acted (specially by Luis Lima and Leontina Vaduva) and well sung (by everybody) and I felt each singer had the right timber voice for their respective roles. A very appropriate use of cameras and a clever and tasteful set design, direction and montage contribute as well to make this version worthy of its release on DVD. You will not be deceived by this one."
2,Wonderful Book,"We read this book for our education class at the University of Mississippi. Although this book is aimed for children ages 12-13, it is good for any age. Hattie Campbell explains her adventures in such a way that it motivates anyone who is reading this book to become interested in the westward movement. As teacher candidates, we quickly realized that this book could be integrated into all subject areas. This book helps children of today relate with Hattie and the struggles she faced in the 1800's. This selection is an easy read and once started you will not want to put it down until the last page is read."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I only paid a penny for it, and only one side of the tester works on batteries. I'm sure it's just a defective unit, but not worth pursuing any further."
2,A trust in the goodness of creation,"This work I found extremely interesting. In particular I enjoyed chapter two - Jesus and the Ecology of Galilee: Ecological Factors and Human Culture.I found the use made of Halovr Monxes' discussion of place as a contested space very insightful.The work reveals Dr. Freyne's great understanding of Jesus in the context of Galilee. It opened up for me such questions as why Jesus was attracted to the villages of Caesarea Philippi and to Mt Hermon: to the wellspring of the Great River.The following line from page 149 touched me in a special way:""His (Jesus) was a faith that was grounded in a trust in the goodness of creation as he had experienced it and reflected on its mysterious but hidden processes.""May the ebbs and flows of the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus be empowered by this fine work."
1,re-issue,".This Maxi-CD contains a few versions of ""You're My Love (My Life)"" from her first album ""Love Is The Name Of The Game"" (1986).This album was produced by Gerd Rochel (BERNHARD BRINK, DANUTA, INGRID PETERS, JUERGEN DREWS, The LORDS, OHIO EXPRESS, PATTY RYAN, The TREMELOES, WENCKE MYHRE).Also, don't forget her second album ""Top Of The Line"" (also produced by GERD ROCHEL).."
2,"Easy to use, plastic could be higher quality","We purchased the Hunter 44550 a month ago to replace one of the old round non-digital thermostats and the Hunter has been very easy to use. The installation was fairly easy; I encountered a slight problem because the thermostat I was replacing did not have the wires labeled. Fortunately the Hunter installation manual had some wiring diagrams in the appendix and I was able to figure it out. Programming the thermostat is very easy - much easier than another ""H-brand"" digital thermostat that we have in our house. The one down side to the Hunter unit is the quality of the backing plate that mounts to the wall. The plate flexes more than it probably should, hence I am only rating it 4-stars. The thermostat we have from the other ""H-brand"" seems sturdier, but not as easy to program. Minor gripe aside, I would buy this Hunter thermostat again (and I plan to because we have one more thermostat to replace)."
2,"Gritty, raunchy, and gripping","The first book was a bit unsettling. Kildar continues in that vein, but the action and characters grab you and keep you in the seat until it's over.Definately not recommended for children or the thin-skinned. Very strong language and graphic violence are throughout the book. Some scenes are designed to revolt the reader, but if you're looking to get your jollies, look elsewhere."
2,HP Switch!,This is a good switch. I have had it running now for a little under a year. Still works. Would recommend it. The only mistake I made was getting the 8 port. I have a few computers at home. Xbox. PS3. A few servers. Make sure you factor in the amount of devices you have otherwise you'll end up like me under the desk constantly swapping out ethernet cables.
1,Normally a fan of Coupland,"But this one didn't stick. Microserfs? A-plus. Gen X? That book was rich with character and story telling. Miss Wyoming just doesn't quite do it for me. I actually didn't even notice when this book was written, but i assume after those, but it feels like one of those writers that....I don't want to say has run out of stories to tell, but isn't writing like he loves it anymore. Maybe I'm being harsh because I know he's a great author"
2,You need to see this movie!,"This is such a good movie! Kevin Kline plays a man who has a bad relationship with his wife (the lovely Kristin Scott-Thomas) and his son (Hayden Christensen, pre-Anakin Skywalker). A terminal illness forces him to reevaluate his life and try to make the most of the time he has left. This is an incredibly emotional film that always, always makes me cry. All three of the lead performers should have received Oscar nominations, in my humble opinion."
1,Not worth $1.00,You get what you pay for. Paid $1.00 plus shipping. Wast of money. Does not work correctly with iPhone.
1,Awful,Shambles of an erotic thriller the sex scenes are virtually non existent and the story line is terrible i was very dissapointed with my purchase and encourage all to avoid this film.
1,Screw up,Ordered a printer at the same time as the cables. The cables were back ordered. Got the printer with no problem. The mailing label for the cables had my billing city & zip code instead of shipping city & zip code so USPS could not findnthe address & sent it back. Guess no one had a phone!
2,"Yummy, and ""more healthier"" as my kids would say","We love these!Beware, though, the warehouse is sending out the wrong amount. You should get 3.3 pounds of product. That's 6 boxes of 6 packets. If you get a single box, email or call Amazon!Annie's Mac and Cheese is also GREAT - both the single serve and the different flavor boxes.Enjoy!"
1,Skip this - Buy something else,"After playing it maybe 5 times, the screen went out and all you get now is sound. Not recommended."
1,Too Many Mistakes,"I was considering buying this book for a birthday present but fortunately happened to see a copy in my local library. It reads easily but has several gross historical and geographical errors which make me wonder about the accuracy of the facts in the rest of the book. The most egregious of these errors (page 66 and elsewhere) places the Cumberland gap near Cumberland, Maryland, when in fact it is at the Kentucky / Virginia border some 400 miles to the southwest. Also, I wonder about the cotton mill in Utica, New York in 1811 (p-150). How did the unspun cotton get from the south to a frontier town in upstate New York at that date ? I feel that there is simply no excuse for any non-fiction book on a historical subject to be marred by errors which could and should have been easily detected."
1,It underestimates our inteligence.,"Ok, I've seen it after the american version and I was very disapointed. The problem is not the lack of special FX or the peculiarities of japanese culture, the thing is that in this version every single character seems to have paranormal powers, which is ridiculous. While in the american version the mystery is solved simply by examing carefully the images of the tape, in this one everybody has visions and dreams, which make the movie less rational (if we can say so of a horror movie). Also, the american version leaves more open doors to Samara's story (Sadako), this one tells everything."
1,Welcome to the meatgrinder of dice throwing,"This isn't your typical Axis and Allies game. It uses similar component's regarding the board and pieces and the combat system is familiar but diffrent in many ways, but the production phase is skipped altogether and you receive random reinforcements in its place.Historic detail is nice. Most places of importance of the Normandy Campaign are on the map and the military units are named on the reinforcement boards so you get to know what you play with.The problem is with the game itself. There is very little room for tactical play and basically it is a meatgrinder of dice throwing. This maybe fun a couple of times but after that you will not be playing the game that much.I have the feeling that this game was rushed in the 60 year anniversary of D-Day and could have done with a little more playtesting."
2,Great,I sell books on Amazon and these envelopes are great. The are not super expensive but they do the job. The sticky part is super sticky so you don't have to worry about taping it.
2,GOOD CD,"THIS CD IS very very good. i enjoyed this cd very much and i suggest you all buy it cause it is that good. the besy songs on it are break stuuf, nookie and re-arranged"
2,I love this book!,"A wonderful, therapeutic book. It made me laugh and cry and nod in agreement. It is so much more pleasureable to read than ""Promiscuity"". So much more hopeful! I speak as a member of the generation that raised people Gwen's age and have always considered this group special. They are my generation's kids! I have learned a lot about this group from this book. From a ""cool"" mother!"
2,Very good with few week points,Overall the book was very informative however it didn't answer the question I wanted an answer to. If the Holy Spirit is God how come he doesn't know the time or date of the second coming. Overall though the book does a great job refuting many JW false teachings I definetly recommend this book.
2,Much nicer than the photo,"The photo for this item is washed out and displays the toy with curled, distorted ""wings"" -- the actual item is has smooth wings and the orangy-red coloration on the sides of the head is nice and bright. The material it's made from is silky and the whole item appears well-made."
2,Favorite Christmas Movie,We have an old colorized VHS version of this movie and I wanted to upgrade to a DVD. It's the only movie we have watched in which I have seen my husband cry.
2,Loved It!,This movie is so fun. I sure hope that the two of them make more movies of the type again. Loved it!
1,Just another crappy shock band,"All these guys get together and say ""lets scream for false reasons to get all the kiddies to buy our album"" These guys are so boring sounding. They look like an ad for addidas. come on people! The last straw was when the lead singer claimed that korn was the first band to combine rap and rock. EXCUSE MEEE!! I believe that run dmc was doing it back in the 80's. On top of that why are all korn's fans such jerks? I'm around a lot of these people and a lot of them I knew well and they are a bunch of sh** heads."
1,"MAN, WHAT A TURKEY LOL!","This has to be the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever seen. Nothing at all like the cover suggests.Horrible acting, NO ZOMBIES - unless you call chicks with bad eye liner zombies LOL!Cardboard & plywood makeshift sets thown together in an empty warehouse (reverb echoes and all), props from a Good Will store...looks like it was made on a $20 budget. Luckily, I only RENTED it. Kiss that $4 bucks goodbye LOL!Why, oh WHY would anyone even MAKE something so dumb? On a scale of 1 to 10, this total waste of plastic comes in at -99."
2,Celebrity Cameo,"Could not care less about Sara Evans' music, but my best friend is the ""Looker, smooth talkin' son of a gun"" from Suds in the Bucket. This alone warrants a 5star review."
2,The Adventure of The Watsons Go To Birmingham,"In the Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham the main characters are Kenny, Byron, Mama, Dad, and Joey. Some of the main events that take place in The Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham are Kenny helping Byron get his lips of the frozen poll outside. Also, when Byron decides to go out and get a conk without his parents permission and ruining his African American hair. The most important event in this story I think is when the Watsons Go to Birmingham on there vacation. This book is mostly fiction is only has one real event that actually happens in real life. The event that is real is when white people bombed an African American church!"
2,one of the best albums of the decade,I didn't think this CD was all that when I bought it but now I listen to it and it's truly an r&b classic of the 2000's and much better than the other music out there today though she's following the footsteps of many musical legends that came before her and inspired her. She writes beautiful piano hooks and sings beautiful melodies with her gorgeous voice and that's what makes all those grammys mean something.
1,Check your state laws before buying,"I bought 2 of these, but didn't have enough of some letters. If you shake the frame a certain way, then the letters slide over/under each other if not secured. I regret not checking my state's laws before buying; if I use it on my car then I could get fined because it blocks over a certain % of my state's name. Now the frame is just in the box in the garage. :("
1,"cheap, writes well","This pen is VERY cheap. It feels so light, I worry it would blow away if I left it outside. Also its very ugly, and definitely will NOT win you any style points. It writes well, and consistent and you have to really TRY to get it to bleed (by coloring in the same spot for a long time). I don't like the way it scratches the paper. It feels like a cheap marker.Honestly if I need something that writes well and does not bleed, I'd rather just use a pencil."
2,"GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON, but PRODUCT NOT THE GREATEST","This is a decent price for these refills, and the free shipping is definitely nice. My only problem with these packets is that they don't last very long. They have been lasting approx. 2 wks per pack - so that adds up. They just don't hold very much toothpaste. But the toothpaste that they do contain, the fresh mint, is very good - good tasting and goes well with the sonicare.PROS: Tastes good, good price.CONS: Doesn't last long."
2,Please judge this book by its cover!,"This is a great book about a lady who was a ""sweeper"" back in the 1950's. She managed to keep her family of 10 children afloat by winning prizes from contests. Every $1 win helped with the family finances and the big wins.....the grocery spree ($4,000 with today's dollar value), a new sports car, and $5,000 ($35,000 with today's dollar value.....really helped the family out! I highly recommend this book!"
1,Potentially Bootleg,"I was fishing around trying to find a customer review for this film, and what I found disappointed and disturbed me. The only review I found said (a) the quality was not very good, having been described as a ""16mm film transfer"", and (b) it's bootleg besides. I think Amazon might want to take this item off the website, especially if (b) is true."
2,This was a great deal....,strats...tele...just about any solid body..will fit in this bag....got my Wildkat in it now...til I buy a HSC later...great for the Washburn Series-X also...
1,I have to give this a star?,"I bought this mop and returned it after its first use. The mop head popped off multiple times in the midst of mopping after securing it properly. The engineer in the house interjected a second opinion said it didn't look very functional either. Thank you, Bed, Bath and Beyond for making the return painless."
2,very suspenseful,"I had never seen this movie before. I watched it yesterday and was very pleased. As usual, Alfred Hitchcock did not disappoint. He is usually in one scene in his movies but I did not see him in this one. Still have Vertigo to watch. Thanks for sending it so fast. Lorrie Gibson"
1,Pius the 12th silent?,"This book claims that Pope Pius the 12th and the Catholic Church, for the most part were silent during the Holocaust. In a way that is true. The Pope learned early in the war that to speak out against the Nazis only brought about more severe retributions. Even leading Jewish clerics warned him not to do so. Instead he acted behind the scenes to save the lives of Jews, Gypsies, and others. He ordered Vatican buildings,convents and monasteries to hide and protect these hunted human beings from being slaughtered to the best of his ability. He ordered false baptismal and Communion documents to be printed up and given to these oppressed people. He even provided money and gold of his own to purchase freedom for some. Lets remember that the Vatican itself was an occupied country during the war. The fact that the Pope and the Catholic Church saved as many as 800,000 Jews during the war speaks volumns in itself.Would that the rest of the world had been as silent."
2,Short story collection,"I believe it takes a special talent to be able to produce a good short story, particularly these days when there are not many publishing outlets for them. This collection then, is especially welcome since it brings together short stories from many famous authors. Like any collection, however, it contains stories that are good, and stories that are bad, and some that are a little of both. It's to the credit of the editor that he has produced this work, and I recommend it to those who enjoy reading shorter works from some of their favorite authors. Despite some of the shortcomings of this collection, I am looking forward to the next edition of this work, if only for the continuation of the last story in the collection."
1,Badly printed,"Don't know where the book has been printed, but I think that a book about design, with a lot of images used as reference, should avoid such errors like wrong offsets and dotted prints, making images sometimes unreadeable."
2,Fantastic Trilogy in multi-channel audio,"As the title says - this is an MVI DVD set. It is not DVD-A. That aside, as others have said more profusely, this is an awesome rendition of the original disks. Pretty much more than any other artist, I enjoy Donald Fagan (and Steely Dan) in multi-channel audio. I was very familiar with the 2-channel versions when they came out, and the detail and nuances of the remastering are well worth the price of entry. It is just magical when you turn up the volume and just listen."
2,High School Algebra,Here is a down-to-earth book on the essentials of what a student should know by they time they leave high school.
1,Nepotism at its finest.,"I don't understand the hype about this book. The writing style was amateurish. The ending was telegraphed right from the start, the only shocking think was just how over the top it was. The only reason this manuscript wasn't thrown in the trash where it belongs, is clearly because of his father who just happens to be the editor of Sports Illustrated."
1,Rip off artist,"This album should be boycotted by real hip hop heads//before biggie comes back from the dead//and puts this buster in a hospital bed....For ya'll that don't know G Black hasn't always sounded like biggie. He just recently switched his flow up(check his mixtapes from two years ago). He jacked BIG's entire style from rap to clothes to video's, and that beat he jacked for his ""hit"" single compton is from a classic dancehall song from over 10 years ago. He's a biter plain and simple....pick up Wordsworth ""Mirror Music"" or Jean Grae ""This Week"" for some real HIP HOP, or if yous a youngin grab some BIGGIE and call it a day!"
1,Lousy and pretentious,"This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. Absolutely boring, lame movie about the life of privileged people. Maybe they think this is entertaining, but this is one of those films you will swear you've seen before. Just don't even bother. BTW, what man isn't like this guy? Give me a break."
1,Save yourself while you can...,"The esteemed reviewer that wrote the review titled ""Danger, Danger, Danger"" has summed it up very well. The first few books are very good... then not so much. Add to that the fact that there are 11 (yes, 11) of these tomes released to date, and the story line is still in a complex shambles with little sign of ending, and you have a sad continuation of a series that started with excellent potential.And another thing (pet peeve time) what is up with the cover art on these books?!? Could they possibly have picked worse artwork? It's horrible... HORRIBLE...Anyway, I gave this book 2 stars, +4 for the first few books, -2 for the rest. Start this series knowing that the first 4 or so books are very good, then you should move on and read Wiki for the plot summaries on the rest. You'll save yourself weeks of wasted time to read more worthy books."
2,Helpful Information,I bought this so that when I hire people to do work in my home I am able to identify by their tattoos whether they have been in prison or been involved in gangs. You have to be careful who you let around your family and in your home. This book has very useful information and pictures to help you avoid a potentially bad situation.
1,Beware!!!,"I spent over $30 for this book, (my fault). What a disappointment. How can a normal person afford such extreme measures?! HCG? Injections once a day? Not available in US though, maybe you could just get on a plane in your spare time and go to Germany! Organic, all natural, low sugar, low fat, were common sense, no new stuff, but was informative. I can't believe the money this author is making on the common customer that can't afford this stuff. He talks about movie stars losing all this weight because they went by this program. I suppose that could be true since a millionaire can afford it...Oh well, live and learn."
1,"Deep down, you know this is the wrong vacuum cleaner","I haven't had this vacuum for even 6 months, and it no longer works. The ""self-cleaning"" HEPA filter doesn't, and when it becomes packed with dirt and dust, the entire vacuum loses suction. Then when you go to empty the clear canister, blobs of dirt fall onto the floor and the base of the vacuum.I paid around $280 for this vacuum because I have allergies, and a dog, and this was supposed to be top of the line. This is a top of the line disgrace to the Hoover Company."
2,Devon is great!,"My favorite songs on this album are ""Rain Song"" ""Montreal Waltz"" and ""Generic Love Song"". All of which I think show her vocal talents and songwriting ability. I can never get these songs out my head they're so good. I met Devon Sproule and she is a wonderful woman with a gorgeous voice.I adore this album."
1,Disappointing Remixes,"I like Book of Love's ""Candy Carol"" album, and I like many of the extended remixes of earlier BoL songs like ""Boy"" and ""You Make Me Feel So Good"", but I found the remixes on this CD to be uninspiring and repetitive. The track list isn't given in Amazon's information, so here it is:1) Counting the Rosaries (Partial Confession Mix) - 4:112) Counting the Rosaries (Full Confession Mix) - 7:583) Counting the Rosaries (Happiness & Love Mix) - 6:174) Sunny Day (Heal Your Positive Body Mix) - 6:045) Counting the Rosaries (Crying Angels Mix) - 5:036) Counting the Rosaries (Album Version) - 3:327) Sunny Day (Single Remix) - 3:48"
1,A movie to forget...quickly.,"I have never seen a movie as dull as this. The plot, characters and screenplay are absurd; not because of the concept that in its self could have been good...but because of the sheer stupidity and lack of conciseness and strength used in building these. Dont waste a minute of your precious exsistence on this absurdly bad movie, though in the end, as all extremely stupid movies, it is rather comical to watch. Finally, why be competent in making a movie when it is so easy to be incompetent. Just forget this obnoxious concoction...it is a contamination to your intelligence. - N"
1,Not as good as I expected..,I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it.I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..
2,Couldn't find it,"My son could not find this movie anywhere, so we were thrilled to see it on Amazon. Looking forward to surprising him for Christmas."
2,Thought provoking,"First class writing - Ruth Rendell is one of the best writers of this genre. Great plot, truly believable characters and despite being written decades ago, it still rings true to today's world. Rendell's characters are real people in life-like situations and Wexford is one of the most down to earth detectives ever imagined who comes to life on the page with a humanity that we should all strive to achieve in reality.I recommend this book to all readers who appreciate great writing, great characters, intricate plotting and an author who understands the frailty of human existence and the nuances of human interaction, both intellectual and emotional, in our daily lives.LR"
1,Save your money,"I like most fans of Rev. Walker look forward to his new cd's. This cd is a major disappointment. The music is not up to par with his earlier works. Many of the songs don't even sound like he had anything to do with them. If I there was any way I could get my money back, I would definitely return this cd. Do yourself a favor, listen to his earlier works and pass on this one."
1,I didn't like it either...it should be 0 stars,"The game play is fine other than the glitches other reviewers have noted. However, I refuse to use any software that requires an internet connection in order to be used. What if that internet phone line is my personal phone line also? Then every time I play the game that line is tied up and none of the other family members have access to a phone. What a needless hassle.The game instructions refer to a ""offline mode"" but it doesn't seem to work. They even have a customer help website that has a ""How to make the offline mode work"" thread, (which indicates there is a problem)but it seems to be written for some other game because the instructions didn't work for my game.My conclusion: Save your money. If they spent millions of dollars developing this game then someone somewhere was grossly overpaid! I paid $50 for my game but it's now in the county dump. Skip this one."
1,Nice concept poor execution for multifunction capabilities,"Got this to use with an HP laser/fax/scanner multifunction printer to share between two computers. Don't waste your time with this unless all you want to do is use it strictly as a print server, no scanning. Just buy another multifunction printer and save yourself a lot of aggravation and time. Even though the printer I hooked it up to was listed as a supported printer, it would not work properly as a scanner on the remote computer. Plus you need to ""connect"" to the print server manually in order to scan even if you do get it working. Tech support was useless provided only rudimentary suggestions, as is typical, and was a further waste of time.On the other hand, Amazon provided exceptional service when I wanted to return it, and processed the return in record time."
1,More useless weaklings,Expect something that would really clean. Hah! These are no more heavy duty that a face scrubber. Bad purchase for me
2,ANGELS ON EARTH!,"I love this book. I have read numerous self-help, and spiritual books, but this one is written by an earth angel. For years, I feared writing down my goals because I wasn't clear about what I wanted or how to accomplish them. I just finished writing down my goals, and am preparing to launch my celestial experts. Hiring the Heavens has helped me become clear in every area of my life. It is simple, fun, and creative. Thank you Ms. Slatter!"
1,MCSE Implementing and Supporting Web Sites Using Microsoft S,This is probably the worst MCSE Study Guide that I have ever purchased. Does the author even know about the subject? The examples are horrible and the content is horrible. People WILL NOT be able to pass the Site Server test after reading this book. This is the biggest waste of money. Please learn from my mistake and don't buy this book.
1,Revisits Old Stereotypes,"I'm always delighted to find a book that includes a character with autism. If that character has any special talent or ability, then more often than not that character is written as a cookie-cutter formulaic savant. To make matters worse, sooner or later others in the story compare the character to R*** M**, the title role Dustin Hoffman played in a 1988 movie. Most people with autism with or without savant abilities are NOTHING like that cliche character and R** M*** is a highly offensive slur in the autism world. I am sick and tired of savant stereotypes, especially since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population!"
1,didn't work for me,"I put batteries in and plugged into my computer like instructed. Supposedly everything was downloaded. I turned it on and put it outside so it could find location. I pplaced it where it couldn't be seen near rear windshield. Green light was blinking. When I plugged it back into computer, not only did it NOT have any information about where car had been, the computer said the device wasn't detected!!!!. Tried to contact mfr help, but didn't get any satisfaction. If I hadn't already thrown away packing slip(spouse almost saw it!....he's the reason I got it), I would have sent it back."
1,Poor Quality,"Based on other reviews I must have received one of the few lemons. The trigger button popped off while removing the packing material and would not stay snapped into place when using the saw. I could not get any oil to flow to the chain no matter how hard I pressed. The cutting power even on 4"" limbs seemed weak but this may have also been a lack of chain oil. All in all I was very disappointed with this saw."
2,Healthy glow,"After reading the positive reviews and tips about this foundation, I decided to try it. I'm glad I did, but also a little sad. Sad because it's NOT cheap and now that I've tried it, I just can't go back to using another foundation! It takes the red out of my skin and gives it a dewy, even glow. It's never cakey and doesn't settle into my lines. As others have said, use a brush and it will blend perfectly every time. Also, when spraying onto the brush, use quick little bursts, apply then spray another quick burst if needed. It really doesn't take much and you don't want to waste any. I probably wear this foundation 4 days a week, (in order to make it last longer). I really don't care about looking ""flawless"" when I'm running errands or working out! For those days, I just wear a tinted moisturizer (Sonia Kashuk from Target, is an excellent one).Almost forgot-this foundation does not make me break out as have many I've tried and it's a bit cheaper on Amazon than at Nordstrom's."
2,A great series,"Another great book in the Bolitho series. A must-read for any fan of historical naval fiction, but start at the beginning! Twenty-seven books in the series, all very entetaining novels!"
2,Masterpiece - plain and simple!!!,"Amazing!!! I Love how E.Lynn Haris keeps his readers up to date on all of his charaters. There is no one he won't touch with this novel. I was truely blessed by this fragile subject matter. ""Does my love for God go away because I love men?"" There are so many black men in churches all over the country wondering if God truely loves them. What if I like being BI sexual? Can I still live a life blessed by God? Harris, says yes!! Why not? When you think of all the young people in your church, ask yourself the same question.This was a funny, endearing, supersing, and well thought out piece of life. HOLD ON, and Enjoy the ride!! You won't believe who you'll see along the way."
2,More evidence that 4AD was brilliant...,"This was the template for an entire era of production using samples and processors. As a youngster who bought this 12"" in 1986-87, I found it to open up an entire world of soundscapes and production concepts.What I liked even more than PUTV was the little treasure hidden as the B-Side called ""Anitina (First Time I See She Dance)"". This track was a sharp contrast to the bouncy A-Side hit: dark, moody, and dense with distorted guitars, feedback, and real-time delay treatments. The B-side was more in line with the rest of the progressive and experimental 4ad catalog, and likely was under appreciated by the average consumer of this title. For my 7th grade ears, it was a glimpse into a very creative period for European alternative music."
1,POOR CONSTRUCTION,"I just ordered this machine and in assembly, a hole on the machine did not align with a hole on the part to which it was to be secured. The 2 holes are 1/4"" apart. Unable to get any customer service from HOOVER, who did not even include an 800 number. Called long distance, phone rang then just stopped. Will never buy HOOVER again - customer service is non-existent. I'm returning it immediately. I would rate it no star but have to check one star to get this review shown."
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this wallet is poor. I would not have bought it if I had a chance to touch it before buying. The zipper does not close smoothly; the leather looks just barely leather; it has a bad smell; glue is visible in some places; the finishing is rough. Generally the workmanship is of the lowest quality; I gave it 2 stars as it just might be the best you can get for this price, and because it fits all my cards."
2,Deserves 6 Stars!,"Dwight's voice is like a knife that tears into my soul with stinging sweetness and his lyrics are mesmerizing. He's a singing storyteller who is in a league of his own. I can hardly articulate what I find most impressive about Dwight, and what appeals to me about this particular album. It's beautifully stark, traditional yet contemporary, the lyrics are honest and descriptive, the production is fine and music first-rate. This album is classic, just like Dwight. Part of the making of a Legend. No wonder Buck Owens and Johnny Cash liked him and thought of him as a worthy successor. He was and still is. I just wonder when he will get the recognition he is due??"
1,Terrible oboe reed,I guess for 8 bucks you can't expect much. Well that's certainly true in this case. An absolutely lousy oboe reed and no amount of scraping will make it decent. Bad responsiveness and flat top octave notes. Stay away is all I can say.
1,Bunk,"I started reading this book which echoe'd a lot of other books in this genre, but partway through the book something seemed off. I went online and started to look more into David Hawkins and Kinesiology, which is used as a basis for all of his claims.Pretty soon the entire world of woo and pseudoscience that this book is based on came crumbling down and I realized just how misguided books like this are.It's ignorance and prejudice masking itself as enlightenment, with Hawkins as the self-appointed arbiter of good vs. evil (but cleverly hidden behind the practice of kinesiology).The only redeeming thing about this book is that it precipitated the undoing of a lot of unfalsifiable and erroneous beliefs that I had accumulated over the years that has been based on bunk like the kind Hawkins peddles to the unwary."
2,Its basically the same game from 2 years ago,"Lets face it people, Madden is outdated, its just not fresh anymore. The gameplay is the same from 2 years ago which is still too slow, the only difference is the graphics get a ""little"" better each year and the rosters are updated. The addition of Owner Mode is pretty cool, i really like the feature where you can hire real NFL coaches and setting the prices of different things. After playing the game for a long time, you begin to realize some things that bring the game down. First off, the Packers are WAY! overrated in the game, Michael Vick is rated too high for a QB and Madden was way off on his rating for Culpepper and the Vikings. These little things combined with sluggish gameplay make this game outdated. If you want to be an owner stick with Madden, If you want to be a PLAYER pick up ESPN NFL Football. GO VIKES!"
2,Tree Girl,I think that this is a good book for teenagers. It had a lot of good points. It shows a lot about real life. It tells a story about a little girl that has lost he family. and has to make it on her own.
2,"Does it's Job, WAYYYYY Cheaper than ordering from GE",This Filter is original and is way cheaper than ordering it Direct from GE.... GREAT BUY!!!!
1,Not for the real health conscious,"This is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store. Nature Valley is a General Mills product. Very average, and you wouldn't expect much from it. The second ingredient (to whole grain oats) is high maltose corn syrup. Not an optimal ingredient, as we are learning. The other ingredients are eh, so so. They taste fine, a bit sweet, but edible. There are 3 grams of protein in each bar, 140 calories, and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces. That is about 4 bites worth for most adults, probably average for these kinds of ""grocery store"" bars. On the plus side, if you are need something that doesn't melt; chocolate coatings, etc. this would work for you."
2,A little bit of everything,"Nice compilation of a variety of music, from classical to jazz to blues to French to rock to Indian... perfect for parties. Nothing too ""out there"" and nothing too tame, either."
1,The Author is Double-Jointed,"He has to be since he spends so much time patting himself on the back. This is a bad book, pure and simple. The author spends an inordinate amount of time talking about his history of losing money and making money. But the stories aren't in great detail and come off as braggadocio. In addition, his advice is minimal and simple. He goes through the time value of money and how yields on small amounts of money invested for many years will allow you to retire well off but doesn't really give creditable advice on retiring really rich, other than buying his newsletter.I cannot emphasize enough how bad this book is. Only two other times have I not read a book I started in its entirety. Here's number three. I read the first half and scanned the last half. I assure there was no improvement. Take a pass on this turkey."
2,Perfect,"I must say up front, I don't have this particular CD, although I have other holiday CDs by Perry Como. I just want to second reviewer Rodney Wiltin's comment about the track IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS. I have it on another CD and, in my opinion, this was a perfect take and is, by far, the definitive IT'S BEGINNING. All other performances of it are lame in comparison. I play it many times during the Christmas season and it awes me."
2,Poignant,"When I read this book for a college course two years ago, I couldn't stop crying. True, some aspects of the book might be dated, but the idea that there might be something transcendent beyond the daily facade of ordinary life--and people's striving for it--is still as relevant today as it ever was. And the thought that maybe there is no such transcendence, that Lily fell not because she was unlucky but because the ""perfection"" she was searching for or represented was only ever an illusion, can still bring tears to my eyes. (Sorry this is somewhat incoherent.)"
2,Digital Watch,"This is a good digital watch. The numbers are plain and it also has the date on it and is easy to use. I bought this watch for my Mother. It has other features, but she does not use them. However it makes a good basic digital watch."
1,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","This would be a great submarine sim (I love submarine sims!) if the software worked. It doesn't. Further, UbiSoft's technical support is abysmal -- ""Just do a clean reinstall and start over.""1.) Game crashes and/or freezes frequently.2.) Saved games are arbitraily lost.3.) Time acceleration can dump you in the midst of attacking destroyers and bombers, even if it's the middle of the night in a rain storm. Sometimes, the destroyers are invisible!4.) When you try to upgrade your submarine, you die. Only, you don't know it until the next time you start the game.My machine may not be the hottest thing going, but it's plenty good enough to meet the stated minimums for this POS.Summary: This is a potentially wonderful sim wrtten by crappy programmers. If you get it for $9 you paid too much. If you spend your $ on this, good luck."
2,Best Showerhead I ever had...,I should have had one of these 50 years ago..Works great and is simple to install...
2,Excellent!,"I read the book, saw the movie, and thought both were great! Good Job. If you haven't read the book, I suggest doing so."
2,This book is to long for college classes,"This book provides a great deal of indepth information. It was required reading in Chinese History Studies At Oklahoma State University Under Dr. Park, who completely tried to destroy every reasonable rational the book provided and used certian passages to distort history to fit his idea of it. So buy the book, stay out of Any classes taught by Dr. Park and learn on your own."
2,Assembly is tricky -but great buy,"The other write-up is correct - the directions are not the greatest, but I was able to put it together myself. I did have to have my husband tighten everything and put in the last 2 screws, but it was a good buy for the price, and now the golf bags have a place!"
1,Not What You Think,"After careful consideration I purchased the Wind Tunnel...At first it worked like a dream, although it was very heavy and quite loud but I decided that must be necessary. The fact that it has so many rollers is both good and bad in that the vacuum is unable to pick up larger items such as pennies. Because of this fact, I believed it would be impossible for me to ""brake"" the vaccum. You see you must first gather by hand all items that won't be picked up. After 3 months of bragging what a great vacuum it was one of the rollers quit turning. My husband took it apart and discovered the ends were attached with plastic which literally melted apart. ?????? What a stupid design flaw. I promptly took it back to COSTCO and bought a cheaper, quietier and better vacuum for...less."
2,"I really like this unit, it is so cool!","My friend introduced me this product which was just brought into market. I did not know this product is so COOL until I saw it. Comparing to other similar products, the price is really attractive. I also like the quality of the LCD screen. It just vividly showed the pictures I got in different places. Although this product is not from a big brand but I think the quality is nothing less than something from a big name."
1,Armband/belt clip useless,"Overall the radio is not bad for a small little radio, but the armband is very small, wont fit most men, and is not durable. The belt clip is a poor design in that it un clips its self from the radio when you clip it on a thicker belt. sound is good but the reception is only fair at best"
2,Review for Resume Guidebook purchase,The book arrived in the condition described in a reasonable amount of time. Good purchasing experience.
1,"Makes things shiny, but doesn't really remove tarnish.","Purchased this to remove tarnish from my brass wood burning stove door. It made the brass shiny, but really didn't remove much tarnish. This is one of the few things I have returned to Amazon."
1,Dissapointing attempt at writing on important topic,"This book appears to have been butchered by non-scientific editors who have removed essential explanation of diagrams and shortened any sentence that appeared to have syntax that would trouble anyone over the age of thirteen. I opened it with high hopes since I was looking for a gentle introduction to an important topic that I could recommend as initial reading for students. But I hesitate to let students near it since it has so many mistakes and blunders. (One quote: `Together with Niels Bohr, Wheeler discovered fission'. Has any scientifically educated person looked through the text before publication??)The fact that diagrams are full of elements that are not referred to in the text is symptomatic of the very unprofessional way that this book has been produced. Aczel actually has some nice persnal anecdotes... what a wasted opportunity!"
2,Little Guardians is a page turner to not be missed!,"I will first admit that I am not a steady reader of any books but this story will captivate you and draw you in and soon you'll see the pages turn and the beautiful, magical story unfold. I was able to envision each scene as the author captivates with so much indepth description, you almost feel as if you're there in Fay Surety's adventures. The love and comraderie as the two different worlds of Guardian Meadow and Guardien Park fill your heart with pride and makes you long to be part of such a loving, giving and supportive family. If you liked ""Harry Potter"" and his friends, you will definitely find as much love, excitement and mystical adventure to fulfill your dreams with the Little Guardians!!!!!!!"
2,Great book!,"This book is one of Ed Yound's finest. It is very beautifully rendered in a sort of abstract, pen and ink style which is very dramatic and striking. Anyone who enjoys myths from around the world will be charmed by this story and the way it is presented. I have bought this book for several people and it has been very well received by adults and children alike!"
1,Horrible Cinematography,I love this ballet and had high hopes. The quality of the film appears that it was done with a cell phone in the back of the auditorium.I had seen the ballet live when it came to a city near me and was horribly disappointed in this 2009 DVD.
2,Rocio Durcal..The Best keeps getting Better!!,"I have always admired Rocio Durcal for her amazing voice. Her last 5 productions have been have been terrific and what makes them so great is that each one is like a little different world. In this, her most recent production. Rocio demonstrates once again that she is the very best and the Ultimate Queen of Spanish music. My favorites from this album are ""Sombras Nada Mas"" of course, ""Caminito"", ""Nostalgias"", ""A media Luz"" and ""En esta tarde Gris"". I love this album, I have heard it 10 times today already and I still want more!! She has a harmonious voice, I am so proud to be her fan because she is truly the best, and the best thing is that she doesnt have to do a ""crossover"" like other artists to prove that she is the very best. I hope that she records many, many more albums in years and years to come"
1,Maybe I've turned into a prude...,"Am I the only one who doesn't think a song about a pedophile (Godfrey) is cool or cute on a children's record? This album has some real gems on it, and I will admit to chuckling the first time I heard Robbie Fulks sing ""Godfrey."" (I sometimes laugh at South Park, too, but not with my toddler in the room.) I have to ask all the other reviewers, as well as the folks at Amazon, what does it say about us that we find songs suggestive about pedophelia cool, hip and appropriate for our kids? If my objection makes me a prude, then that's a badge I will wear with honor."
1,mask fit,"Reading the positive reviews, i thought this would be a no brainer. Unforunately i was wrong. The mask material is properly made, but the fit was not snug at all. Everytime underwater there would be a leak and water would easily get through into the mask. I've had to adjust the goggles mostly everytime i complete a leg in the pool. I've had to go back to my original swimming goggles to having an uninteruppted swim. FYI - i am an adult, asian male and maybe this just didnt properly on my face. Maybe having a flat nose affected the placement. I believe if there had been any mention of face structure, it would have been a huge factor on deciding to purchase these swim goggles. Now I know and hopefully this helps someone else."
1,Terrible,"I spent hours trying to get my computer to recognize this thing and was finally able to get it sort of installed, though I realized at that point that you can't scan from a multifunction device through it - you have to plug the printer back into the computer via USB to scan. I did this and then went back to wireless, only to find that it had corrupted the printer driver, so I had to download and reinstall a fresh copy of the printer driver to get the printer to work at all. After that I stopped using the print server and in the meantime switched internet providers and had a new router and wireless network. Today I decided to try the print server again with the new router/network, but I'm having the same problems with installation (it says it can't find the print server even though they are connected by ethernet cable and all firewall is shut down). I don't remember what fluke allowed me eventually to get past this problem last time, so I'm giving up and throwing it in the trash."
2,Top Notch Fantasy,"Hercules and the Amazon Women can be said to have everything, action, humor, romance, and a great cast ranging from Kevin Sorbo and Anthony Quinn to Roma Dowmey. If you love the Hercules T.V. show, check this one out! also keep a look out for Lucy Lawless in a role before Xena."
1,The Emancipation of Whoriah Scarey,"Mariah really needs to stop using words becasue they sound intelligent, cause nothing on this album resembles anything near an emancipation. It is a cheap beat-driven 'album', which can't even be classified as music.Get Emancipated, or Die Tryin'"
1,this book is a joke right?,"unbelievable ! This book advocates eating raw meat, full cream butter/milk, lots of fatty dairy products. It belongs to a time when men where men and women cooked in the kitchen. And real men hunted and killed their own meat. There have been numerous studies linking the kind of diet this book recommends to bad health. If you want a proper book on eating backed up with proper scientific studies then I would highly recommend 'The China Study' by Dr. T. Colin Campbell. What are the author's credentials anyway, is she a nutritionist? NO, is she a Doctor? NO, is she perhaps a research scientist? NO."
1,You'll get what you pay for.,"I was excited to get such a beautiful set of copper pans for such a low price, however, I was disappointed. They are lightweight (not much copper), and they don't conduct heat nearly as well as my more expensive copper pan. But what is even more disappointing than the food sticking (especially in the fry pans--I can't make a crepe in these without ripping it) is the horrible yellow color they are turning. While my expensive copper pan has developed a beautiful deep red patina, the Calphalon pans have ugly yellow and brown splotches all over them. I wished I would have just saved my money on the Calphalon set and bought just a couple of well-crafted copper pans instead (Mauviel, Falk, or Bourgeat). I feel like I got cheap copper pans at a cheap price."
2,YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS!,"This was my first Duran Duran album, and I have to say it is great. I'm only 22 years old, but I still can remember hearing some of these songs on the radio when I was a kid. They are as good today as they were then. If you grew up, lived through, or even thought about the eighties, you've got to have this album!"
2,For new cable hook,"Excellent material and fits perfect to the thimble of my new synthetic cable, maybe for what I'm using it (atv mudding) can be a little big but works great."
1,Sandmand is silly and pretensious,The author dwells in a world of silly feelings that a healthy individual will not be able to relate to. This whole series is nothing but immaturity disguised as intellectual deep stuff. Stay away from it.
2,BUY THIS,"The first ep on the tape deserves a 5 star in itself! It's very emotional and sad. However, it loses a star because I HATE the english singing voice for Priss. IT REALLY BAD!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"Like ""Claretta's"" review below, I'm finding I'm skipping more of the story than reading. I don't like either main character and find the plot very choppy. This is one of the worst Crusie books I've read and don't know if I'll finish it."
1,not new cd's just a package of allready produced cd's,These were not newly produced cd's. They were a composition of cd's that had been put out before.
1,Buy this book and the authors will get what THEY want EVERY time!!!,"I cannot believe that this book gets 4 stars. It is about the value of putting on a carny magic show to distract the customer, which somehow leads to them buying the product (without telling you how it leads to them buying the product). It doesn't work. This book has nothing to do with persuasion but is about performing sales presentations like a carny hawking rides at the circus. DO NOT BUY if you are serious about sales!!!"
1,Half way there...,"I have tried three different tuners for my Zune, including the Belkin. Two of which connect to the car radio (FM) ok. However, I would like to charge my player as well.When I received the Belkin it was, or so I thought, the device I was looking for. Upon pluging into the device (Belkin) I was happy to have it in an convinent location and charging my player. However, I will not tune clearly to ANY FM station. Also, I now get a low buzz from the cars alternater.I own a newer Xterra and have not experienced this noise since my first car stereo 10 years ago. Too bad, I was really hoping for a killer product.~Disapointed"
2,Very functional and good features for the price,"Though my 4 year old doesn't use it as often as I would like, this is one good watch.Lots of features for the price and pretty solid too."
1,Don't waste your money...,"If you tire of cookie cutter computer manipulated rock, then don't buy this album. It is a waste of money...These guys need to get some originality. There is no creativity here at all and they should find a new direction to their music. No doubts that they have talent, but they don't know how to use it."
2,Classic 60's social-political comedy,"I listened to Tom Lehrer as a kid in the 60's, and memorized most of the songs, but to hear it again is very fun. Also, the songs still resonate - even though the names and issues have changed, the humor is still quite fresh - my wife, who's never heard this stuff, laughs out loud through the whole collection."
1,"Most of the CD was okay, but...","There were noticeable mistakes in the Pianists movement of ""Carnival of the Animals"". Really, really noticeable mistakes. That shouldn't happen in a piece that consists entirely of major scales."
2,Become a better baker with this book,"This is one of the most frequently used cookbooks in my kitchen. The recipes are easy to understand and although laborious at times, the effort is often worth it. I feel that this book has helped me improve my cooking/baking skills tremendously. I would suggest the recipient of this book obtain a heavy duty mixer, since many of the recipes require its use. Julia and her co-author conspirators display a helpful humor, advising the consulting cook not to worry when things look like they shouldn't. I highly recommend this book and have purchased it as a gift for several friends. The beautiful pictures are a great inspiration, as well."
1,"""Cardinal Proof"" but not ""Squirrel Proof""","The perches are much smaller than I thought they would be and the cardinals cannot perch and feed on this feeder. Smaller birds - finches, nuthatches, chickadees and sparrows - have no problem.It's not squirrel proof as they figured out on the second day how to hang from the bottom, avoiding the perch, and eat seed out of the trough. It's not easy for them though and has slowed down the amount of seed I was going through. Also, the top of the feeder slides up easily and they can get inside it by just pushing the top up. My husband put a clamp on one side to fix that problem.I'm disappointed that the cardinals can't get into this feeder and will keep my platform feeder up for them. So in the end, I guess I'm not really using less of the expensive birdseed after all!"
2,Great cover!,"I was doubting about buying this cd or not, but finally i decide to buy it, it has only two tracks, but it's still great! It has a different cover from the normal maxi and single (mariah paradise), actually, the cover is the same as the valentine's one. If you're a really mariah fan, you should buy this!"
1,L is more like an XL,the mountain's shirt sizes are not accurate but their artwork is amazing. 8 more words required to post this review
2,Dorman 38437 Door Hinge Repair Kit,"This Kit did work , but if I was to do it again i would go for the kit with threaded studs"
2,Music SHOULD be entertaining...and this is.,"Our household is LOVING this CD. We also bought Victor Vito and really like it, too.The songs are teaching our 3 and 1 year old daughters so much already, through repetition and rhyming. Very catchy tunes, and if you REALLY want to get hooked on Laurie, watch one of her many videos on display at noggin.com under SHOWS....since we never know when Noggin will be playing her videos, we can log on at any time and our girls can watch and play along with the videos. It's a great break in the day!We all HIGHLY recommend Laurie's CDs, and can't wait to someday see her in concert! The smiles she puts on our girls' faces are well worth it!"
1,YOW! Buy something Else!,"This ranks among the worst software that I have ever used. I have Professional Home Design Suite Platinum version 10. You set the elevation for each floor, the program changes it to something else. Walls appear in the 3-D renderings and can't be erased. The keyboard shortcuts don't work. You apply shingles to the 3-d elevations, and the program renders the windows with shingles. You try to get tech support answers to the above issues and you can't even get past the first tech support screen. Hello...Is anybody home?"
2,"Call It An ""Eh"" Relationship","The Good;Works with any mp3 player or any device with a standard headphone jack.Can charge your mp3 player as you are listening to it.The Eh;Sound quality is NOT CD quality. Sounds more like an old tape.You have to turn your mp3 player and radio up pretty loud to get any sound.This transmitter has a really long cord. I'm sure it would be handy for someone, but that person is not me.The Bad;The display is not back lit. Very difficult to use at night."
2,Ta-Dah cd by Scissor Sisters,This cd has a good selection of pop music including some danceable tunes. I have listened to it several times and have enjoyed the upbeat and lively tone of the music.
2,Not bad for the price,Works great and sounds good. If anyone needs an external card like me who doesn't have an extra pci slot to spare this is definately the way to go.
1,crane fm antenna,"The crane fm antenna proved to be only slightly better than a 300 ohm dipole available from Radio Shack for about $3-$4.00. Keep in mind that the higher up on the wall you go or hung with string (to prevent interference) from a window shade cross member, the better your reception will be with any indoor dipole type antenna. Buy a dipole for $3-$4 and use the remainder for something else."
1,Total rip off,"If you saw Guys Gone Wild then don't waste your time and money on this one. Some of the same guys are in this one as in the first one with no new guys that I recall. There is a longer shower scene with the cute guy from the first one, but that is it. You don't even get to see the two ""big"" guys from the first one. I hope this has cured me from buying these ""movies""."
1,Incomplete Information,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have done hours of research on all types of Bariatric surgery and this book is one of the least informative. Gastric Bypass is hown as the magic answer. Easy, simple, and the only way. In reality this is far from the truth. Gastric Bypass is a huge decision for a person to make, and one that should not be made unless the patient is adequately informed.Specifically the sections covering other surgical options (duodenal switch, gastric banding, etc.) are blatantly biased. While I realize this book is geared toward Gastric Bypass, that is no excuse to give false or incomplete information on other surgeries. Also, the sections on Gastric Bypass itself is very glossed over and makes it seem as though it will be a cure as opposed to a tool for weight loss.There are so many other informative books out there...this just isn't one of them."
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,"I'm sorry to see that most of Debbie Macomber's newest releases are following the same pattern--everybody is sickeningly sweet and there is absolutely no sexual tension, and ""Promise Texas"" is no different. The ""Heart of Texas"" series, (""Promise"" entertains most of the same characters) which started out hot totally fizzled towards the end (I've never read a more disappointing book than ""Lone Star Baby"")and I think Macomber should let this group of characters rest in peace already. Enough is enough!"
2,so very pleased,I have been looking forward to having a copy of this to call my own since viewing a friend's. Reading the books only makes the movies better.
1,Possibly one of the worst games i have played,"week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game..take my advice dont even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i dont think they'll care it's so bad"
1,album: miami,"i have been touch for two songs!!: summer guest ,and over the edge...there are pretty cool!!.The composer is Belgian and his music is esasy to listen...;i wouldn t buy this cd for two songsof course!!but this is my point of view,by the way i hate postal service.peace and love!"
1,Trade it for a better one,"The editor's review was too kind. This book features a dumber-than-rocks protagonist, an inane plot, and inept character development. Don't waste your time."
1,"Couldn't wait for it to end....unbelievable, go for the non-fiction Marcinko","I'm not sure Dick did much of the writing and if he did this book seemed totally unbelievable. I was looking for something I could believe in, but found myself feeling like I was watching some action movie, without all the special effects. It may work for a movie, but the book just did nothing for me. Don't waste your time."
1,Bought and Returned It,"I had no problems with the instructions, but once put together, it didn't fit my bike. The box does claim it fits ""most"" bikes, but honestly, the brackets that attach to the rear frame are so close together it's a wonder it fits ANY bike. My wife and I had to pull the bracket apart to get it on the frame, thereby strectching it almost to the point of breaking it. I took it all apart and diuble-checked the installation. Same thing. Also - The bolt tops and nuts protrude from the brackets enough where it would be easy for a child to get scrapped or cut. Bolt heads should set in the brackets to create a flat surface. Going to look for something else."
1,Poorly made,"I SO wanted to love this blender. I make smoothies and salsa daily and replaced the Tribest with another personal blender. Initially, I was very impressed with the sharpness of the blades and the ease of how well everything blended. This blender, however did not last long, I assumed I had done something wrong and purchased another. The new one worked for only three weeks when things started to fall apart. Over the next 4 months I had multiple parts replaced (I will say the customer service was good and quick to send replacement parts). I followed the directions meticulously (not blending more than 60sec ect), however in less than one year the thing fell apart again. I will NOT purchase this one again, am going back to the Magic Bullet. If you buy this KEEP THE WARRANTY."
2,Handy remote that does everything,"I had seen reviews from others on this remote and had been wanting to try it for myself. Most other high-tech universal remotes were too bulky and I wanted something that could easily fit in one hand. The ergonomics on this is perfect and can easily reach the common buttons using your thumb. It's also pretty easy to setup, took a little time to do some real complicated things, but I figured it out eventually. I love that it has a rechargeable battery and it seems to last about a week before it runs down. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Great Book,I love this book. There are a lot of photos and descriptions. She uses a lot of beading embellishments along with hand formed and stamped images. A different approach than I've seen before. It's filled with different ideas of putting together the fabrics and papers. A great gook.
1,Why buy this when you can have the original?,I don't understand. Why buy this version by Janet Schulman when you can have the original written by Felix Salten himself? Is Salten's version out of copyright? Is someone else trying to make money off of it?
1,Mumbo jumbo,"I saw the author in the magazine Yoga for Everybody was inpressed by the article. The book had to be just as good? NO. I was looking for yoga to stretch and exercise and instead got more religion and philosophy. If your into the yoga as a religous or spiritual quest, this is a good book for you. If you want to learn how to become more toned and limber there are much better books out there. Yoga for men? No. Yoga for New Age Mr. Poneytail types. Yes."
1,"horrible movie, good book","The book is hundreds and hundreds of pages long. I don't know how they expected to do it justice in 2 hours. Changes were made in the film to be more titillating (though the book already has its' racy moments). For example, in the book most of the prostitues are Europeans and Australians from the lower classes and are not described as attractive. In the movie the prostitues are nubile Asians."
1,Too many quirks spoil the broth,"Although not a bad writer, Brenchley cannot easily fit his tale of mysterious amnesia with his tale of an ambiguous angel; it was as if Buffy the Vampire Slayer and NYPD Blue decided to air a crossover episode--the genres are just too different to be a good fit unless handled brilliantly, which is not here the case.I myself found the mystery angle compelling, and was annoyed when the angel angle intruded. This wasn't enough to put me off his work entirely--this was an interesting attempt by a writer new to me--but I can't recommend it as a satisfying read.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
2,Acoustic is GOOD,"I just bought the album today and have listened to it 3 times. I just wanted to comment on the people I see ripping the 2nd disc - I thought it was the best!! My girlfriend and I got in an argument right before I had a chance to listen to the second disc (we were following each other in different cars, thank God) and the second disc made me forget all about it! I seriously think Razor is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. As for the 1st disc, it's pretty good too - regular old Foo - I'm glad to get something new. Buy the cheaper disc - it's worth it! While you're at it, pick up the new White Stripes and System of a Down - I buy pretty much all the new rock and those two albums are GREAT! The Exies is another sleeper/surprise worth picking up - Enjoy!"
2,Alex Mack was a great show,Alex Mack was an awesome show and in my opinion one of Nickelodeon's best. They need to release the other seasons though. ALso its annoying that Jessica Albums all over the dvd and shes only in like ..three episodes. Shes not even a main character.. they could have at least put Ray on the second disc cover. Hopefully we will get a better dvd of this awesome show in the future.
2,Good and functional,"I have been using this kettle now for over a month.Quite satisfied with the performance. My previous kettle was a Breville too and lasted almost 8 years. Was still working but had developed a leak at the bottom which apparently is to be expected after several years of use.This one is good. I like the blue light that comes on when the water is boiling and the little ring when it shuts off. The button at the top, above the handle makes opening the lid very easy.The only reason for deducting a star from my rating is the shape. Could have been a little more elegant. It looks like cut and sealed from stove pipe. It sits on my kitchen counter so I would have expected a more appealing pitcher form to be pleasing to the eye."
2,best i have used,I have had all the various juicers and this one is a work horse performed so well I have given away all the other juicers I usedIt is the only single gear juicer that the auger is offset to accomodate carrots and other vegetables the other single gears cannot accomodate because the auger is directly under the feed tubeA+++++++++++++++
2,Great CD,"I love German Christmas songs! This is a great purchase, with almost all songs I like. Miss Leise Rieselt der Schnee"
1,Very poorly made.,"Very poor construction and quality. Very flimsy; barely took out of box a few minutes to find no functionality at all in the crane. Not durable, not fun, nor educational. Poor design, should not be sold on Amazon. Deters me from ordering similar toys.I have promptly returned the item, and am awaiting my refund confirmation."
1,Lost wisdom,"T. S. Eliot asked,""Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?""This unintentionally bleak commentary on the state of psychological research will not help you locate any answers."
2,ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING,"ART PEPPER HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER, DUKE JORDAN HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. JAZZ HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. IN LEAGUE WITH THE BEST LIVE RECORDINGS BY MILES, COLTRANE, ELLINGTON, MONK, MINGUS, COLEMAN, YOU NAME IT. PURE MAGIC. OVER 4 ALBUMS WORTH OF MUSIC SPREAD OVER TWO CDS. GREAT SOUND. I ALWAYS THOUGHT JAZZ DIED IN THE 60'S. HOW SILLY OF ME."
2,Great basic holster!,"Love this holster! Simple design, easy to use! Its also way cool that it comes with not just the belt attachment, but the paddle as well, which is super comfortable. I have an extended mag release on my Glock 22, and a lot of people complain that it rubs your side when the firearm is holstered... not true at all. This holster rocks! Cant beat Serpa CQC holsters!"
2,THE ULTIMATE BRAIN MASSAGE!,"This CD is simply breath taking.Universal is the disc you play after you've had one of those days that causes you to shut yourself away from the world for a few hours to relax,meditate,and re-gather your senses.I strongly recomend this CD to lovers of deep- melodic-lovemaking-head-massaging-relaxation music.(It's also the ultimate sleep soundtrack!)GURANTEED SATISFACTION!!"
1,Terrible...full of useless vocabulary,"We are fans of Adam Sandler and have enjoyed many of his movies; however, we stopped this one shortly after starting it. The language was unnecessary and not funny at all."
1,Horrible precalc book offers few examples,"This textbook is flat-out bad. It is supposed to serve as a transition between algebra to calculus, but it fails badly due to its inadequate explanations. Many of the problems are redundant, too hard, or too easy. Each section of each chapter offers VERY few examples, and these examples rarely correspond with the types of problems presented as practice. It is littered with typos, errors, answer mistakes, and a general feel of unprofessional publishing. The formulas and important ""boxed concepts"" or equations are often written in an excessively complicated manner. Where it needs to be concise, it drones on excessively. Where it needs an in-depth explanation, it skips over the issue. I used this WHOLE book through junior year and found it very unhelpful. Do not buy it."
2,A must for fans of the Visions of Greece TV program,"Not all the tracks are ""home runs"" but 5 of the tracks were used in the Visions of Greece program shown on HDNET and PBS. Those tracks are truly impressive and even more so when accompanied by the excellent scenery from the TV program."
2,An awesome book,I recommend this to the John Wash 5th grade class of 2013 CAIt's a really good book; you'll love it
1,Very disappointing p,Very disappointed with this book. It ended up being more of a joke book (not that funny). I was looking for a book of projects for my grandson. I bought him several rolls of duct tape but the book didn't have any projects--just foolish jokes. Even my 11-year old grandson was disappointed. Thanks a lot for the Christmas gift fiasco. Don't waste your money. Once you read the jokes there is no need to keep the book.
2,love it,"the case fits my 14"" widescreen laptop perfectly. It also looks nice, was a great bargain, and fits a ton of other textbooks/folders in the storage compartment. I think this is a great buy. The engineering and appearance of the bag gives it a look of quality. highly recommended."
2,Serenely beautiful. Music to meditate by.,"Less expansive and involving than Kater's ""Migration"" (with Carlos Nakai), but this is some of the most serenely contemplative music I have heard. Perfect to play in a darkened room at the end of a numbing day. Seventy-five unbroken minutes of uncomplicated soul-massaging harmony. The blending of real voice, flute, violin, and cello infuse Kater's synthesized sounds with the realm of the natural."
1,Pulls my hair out,"I bought this haircut kit because of all the rave reviews, and the integrated vacuum. The latter works ok, even though the occasional hair goes through the screen and gets stuck. The biggest problem was that it doesnt cut well and actually pulls my hair out. My friend had bought one as well, and has the same problem."
1,Weak because so much is not comics,"The weaknes of this book (and sections of Ricks Story) is not its controversial content but the fact that Sim basically rejects the comics format (which he does well) for page after page of dense badly written (though not as bad as the section in Ricks Story)prose with a single illo per page. If this dialogue was writtten and presented in a comics format it would have been hopefully stripped down ,edited and more readable . As it is it is a real slog and not really worth the effort. A real mess."
1,does not work too well for small amounts of gas in tank,I tried to remove gasoline from my snowblower tank and couldn't maintain a continuous flow to siphon 'all' of the gas out of the tank. It doesn't work for small amounts of gas in the bottom of the tank. I'm going to try Terapump rotary manual drum pump which has good reviews.
2,Reusable dry disc filter,"These are very good filters, especially for reusable. Easy to put on, hold up well in washing and last a good while. I am on my second order of these. And will be buying more. A good price for the product and good service."
2,Corny but good,"I watced this movie as a kid, I liked it then and I like it now. You can't catch it on cable too often though"
2,Well done,"Beautiful film, good acting, stays with the original story as well as a movie can. However, I most definitely recommend reading the book first, because there's so much that has to be cut to make the story fit into 2 hours, and no movie could come close to capturing Zora Neale Hurston's amazing use of language."
1,Junk..,I ordered the heater to help heat my basement. It sure is a disappointment . It has no thermostat and can not be left unattended. Who ever heard of a heater without temperature control. Will it burn my house down?
2,this really works,"have 3 Kittehs and they were all seeming stressed by the latest rescue we brought home. we heard about this product and got it to try. I am delighted to report this really helps all of our Kittehs to be cool and happy with out trying to cram something down the throat or sticking with a needle!! Please keep producing this product. My Kittehs are much better for this. They play with each other and with us, instead of hissing and spitting and growling at each other."
2,"Coby 7"" TV","The Coby 7"" TV that I ordered from Amazon.com last month is a very good TV and it is working very good."
2,Exodus,"For my wife and I this was a return to the year when we were dating. This film was playing and we went to see it. She liked the soundtrack so much that I bought it for her as a gift. This was in 1961 or 1962. We enjoyed the movie then and enjoyed it more this time because of the memories. The fact that we are older and seem to understand a little more about the world also enhanced the experience. Buy it, you will like it."
2,Veggie Songs to dance by...,I have two young grandkids that love to dance to these songs. One is 18 months old and the other is almost 4 years old. What I love about these songs is that they are also teaching about the Bible and you can never start children to soon.
1,There are better books!,"I read several books on finding a mate, and while this book had a few very useful tips, it's focus seemed to be more on bath-houses and ""campy"" humor. Save your money, here! 2 books to buy are: Husband Hunting Made Easy (Patrick Price) and Finding True Love in a Man-Eat-Man World (Craig Nelson). The Patrick Price book is #1 if you only want to buy one book. I used the information from these books, and have found my Mr. Right. Good luck!"
1,I'm not happy with this deal,One of the microphones arrived spoiled. It doesn't run well.It was not a good deal through Amazon web site.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY.,"I bought this CD player about four months ago, and although it worked okay, it ate up batteries and skipped a lot--just walking would trigger it. This CD player is NOT AT ALL good for jogging or working out, because you won't even be able to hear the music with any movement. After dropping it once, it stopped playing ANY CDs, responding with ""NO DISK."" This product is a complete waste of money, and now I can't even return it because my warranty up. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
1,PLEASE READ THE BAD REVIEWS,I HAVE HAD THIS PUMP FOR ABOUT A MONTH. IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS GREAT. BUT ABOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT IT I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS. I HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINTS AS THE OTHERS. ITS EXTREMELY NOISY. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SUCTION ON BOTH SIDES. IT LOSES SUCTION WHILE PUMPING. THE BREAST CUPS LEAK BECAUSE OF THE LOSE OF SUCTION. THE MOTOR SOMETIMES SOUNDS LIKE ITS GOING TO QUIT. IN THE BEGINNING IT EMPTIED MY BREASTS AND I PUMPED A LOT OF MILK. BUT NOW IT'S NOT EMPTYING MY BREASTS. READ THE BAD REVIEWS!!!! I WONDER IF THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PUMP FOR A SHORT TIME AND HAVEN'T USED IT ENOUGH. SPEND THE MONEY AND GET A GOOD PUMP LIKE MEDELA OR AMEDA. YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL IT USED ON EBAY AND GET SOME OF YOUR MONEY BACK.
2,"Good, but seams wear after long term use","I've generally been very happy with this litter box. It's so much cleaner than other setups I've had in the past (you never have to touch the litter at all!) and obviously much less expensive than the robotic kinds.That said, I've owned it for eight or nine months, turning it over to empty it every day, and it has now started to release litter from one of the seams when I empty it. I think that after so many months, the seam between the top and the bottom of the box have been stressed and open a little when I turn it upside down. Not a major issue at this point (it's a small sprinkle of the cat litter), but disappointing given how happy I'd been with it so far."
1,Somehow it didn't work?,I think I purchased a bootleg from the seller? The speed wasn't correct for either the audio and video. I threw it in the trash.
1,Basketballs,"$5 balls foir $20 each - cheap, rubbery, and too big for the hoop they claim to be designed for."
2,Works Great,I've used it all summer and have a 5 gallon jug on it. Easy to set up and I've not had any problems with leaks.Highly recommend.
2,"good quality, lightweight sign holder!","This sign holder is slightly slanted, and the base is about 2.5 inches from front to back. The slant makes it easier to read if it's sitting on a counter or desk.The acrylic that this is made with is very good quality; it's very clear, about 1/8 inch thick and quite light weight.If your sign holder will be in an area where it will get jostled around a whole lot, or will be subjected to heavy use, you might want to consider a heavy weight sign holder.However, if, like me, you just need a sign holder for ordinary, light-use purposes, this sign holder will work fine. I'm very pleased with it and wouldn't hesitate to buy another. (In fact, I'm now planning to buy this same brand in a couple other sizes as well.)"
2,Entertaining Mystery,"Enjoyed Nelson DeMille's sense of humor while still giving us a good, can't-wait -to-get-back-to, story. Would make a good movie."
2,Great for inspectors with minimal experience,Takes an approach that develops knowledge and understanding for inspectors and engineers with minimal to medium experience. Need to give more emphasis on building construction (small and medium size buildings).
2,Real Eel Skin Cigarette Case,I am very happy with this product. I received quickly and it was just as promised. I plan on purchasing another after the first of the year.
1,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE AND ITS THE END OF JANUARY,"I have yet to receive any issue or information on this magazine, will soon be contacting them directly, i think i have gave them enough leeway."
1,Didn't do what I wanted,"I bought it to get rid of tall, thin, wheat-like weeds, but the instructions say it works for weeds with foliage. I sprayed it on them anyway just in case, and now I have a bunch of brown circles in my yard (most of my yard is crabgrass) with the weeds I wanted killed still standing tall. I sprayed it on some other weeds with lots of foliage, and all it did was wilt them a little."
1,If I wanted to be preached at . . .,"I wish I would have read the one star reviews before purchasing this book. I am very glad I only paid $1 plus shipping.I'm 1/3 into it and I can't even read each paragraph because of the non-stop preaching. If I wanted to be banged with a bible, I'd hang out with my in-laws. Good grief, man, what if I was a buddhist? or Jewish? and I just wanted to read a book that would help me with the subject title???This book is totally obnoxious. The few trinkets of real information are repeated over and over, spread thinly between bible quotes and scriptures. Unless you're looking to get preached at, I would highly advise against this waste of paper and text."
1,Not Worth Buying,"I wish I'd rented this movie instead of buying it. I was looking forward to watching a beautiful love story unfold between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Yes, there's a huge age difference between the two in this film but the romance between them was not totally unbelievable. It just wasn't very inspiring. And the entire movie wasn't very interesting or fun to watch."
1,Disposable Cover Song,"The first time I heard this I wanted to kick my TV screen in. Apparently, Sixpence think so highly of this song they're willing to sell it to the hucksters for commercial use. I'm with the LA's fans, get their version which is on a great album. I hope this trend doesn't get out of hand--mediocre bands selling cover versions of great songs to ad agencies. Thank goodness for the Neil Young's of the world who will never sell out."
2,Anti-American?,"How is this Anti-American? You numbskull? Bindly following a corrupt government that is lying to you is anti American. This is the most American movie I've seen in years, its an absolute shame on our corporate controlled media that the topics this film covers are even controversial! 20 years ago, this would have been on 60 minutes. Today anyone in the media who questions our government is CANNED. How American is that? They had to fight, and band independant studios together even to get this movie on the screen! Wake up. America is being stolen from the good people who fought and died to create and defend it, by unscrupulous scum like Bush. Its time to wake up to that. If you love America, you cant turn your back on that."
2,Awesome book!! Again and back again,Read this first when I was 9 and fell in love with the genre from this point on... Reading it to my own child now... And he's spell bound and I'm thoroughly enjoying the wonderful tale Tolkien spins once again.
1,Grammar for Language Arts Teachers,"This book is a little overwhelming at first glance. The authors state that the intended audience is for language arts teachers. I think that it may be more useful for high school teachers. The language in the book is not conducive to early learners or for people who speak English as their second language. As you learn and struggle through the middle chapters, you find yourself starting to understand more of what the book was trying to say in the first chapters. Therefore I think that Chapters 10 and 11 should be the first chapters in this book. I have heard somewhere that a writer should revise first, and then get down and dirty with grammar. Chapter 11 is about revising, which is why I think it should be first and not last.This book was fairly confusing to me; the examples in the chapters were not the best to use for classes. All in all, I would recommend this book for a reference book, but definitely not for a classroom instructional book."
2,V-1 Flying Bomb,"This book deals with the V-1 Flying Bomb,from its inception,its development,and its strugle to become an operational weapon of terror.This is a very short paged book with excellent color diagrams and period b/w photos;a good introductory book."
1,This is the wrong size,"WARNING!!!I purchased this item because the review said it was 5.9"", however it is only 4.5"".It may fit the camera it was intended for, but I purchased it for another use based on the measurements in the description.I guess the joke is on me.You have been warned!"
2,genius of melodic pop,"For me, the criteria for judging the relative genius level of a pop songsmith is how well a song and its melody sticks with you. Prefab Sprout have it all down - all sewn up. How can I ever get out of my mind the irresistible melodies of ""Carnival 2000"" or ""Life Full of Surprises""?Sorry if I have the song-titles wrong or if I don't know the guy's name( Paddy MacLoon?).Names and song- titles are left-brain stuff.Bottom-line is that melody affects the right side of the brain and that's where these songs stick.Genius pop in the vein of the best of Brian Wilson or Lennon-McCartney or Supertramp."
2,essential,"The material features french horn solos from two of the best in the business--Julius Watkins and David Amram. Fuller and Hawes must have been in the mood for something new and different here as co-leaders; french horns just weren't used much for soloing in jazz back then. The album, comprised of originals by David Amram, Teddy Charles and Salvatore Zito, features musically enlightened hard bop for the period. If you don't have it, grab it.Curtis Fuller (trombone)Sahib Shihab (alto sax)Julius Watkins (french horn)David Amram (french horn)Hampton Hawes (piano)Teddy Charles (piano)Addison Farmer (bass)Jerry Segal (drums)"
2,To short,The handle isn't long enough for me to reach across my Jeep Liberty. Why not add another foot to the length?
2,Touching,"This is a very touching movie. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is an awesome actor and this movie shows his talent. I won't go into the details so I won't spoil the movie. However, there are many life lessons in this film. Enjoy."
2,Elegant and convenient,"A very nice and elegant ice-bucket, looks sturdy enough, right size to contain one bottle, and is reasonable priced. An ideal bargain. I highly recommend it."
2,Works like a charm,"I have 2 cairn terriers and this works great to keep the hair quanity down in the house. They do look like they have been groomed especially the wheaten one. The Brindle we have looks a little less groomed, I guess since her hair is just more wiry. It's made such a difference in appreciating their hair coat."
2,Definitely recommended,I found this book incredibly informative. The research that obviously went into it is incredible. I always have the same problem with McCullough's books - they need an editor. About ten percent of this book was superfluous and just didn't fit. Still I enjoyed it greatly!
2,Prancer,Excellent Movie my daughter wanted for Christmas at a affordable price.It is a movie she remembers as a child and wanted it as part to start building herown Christmas Movie Collection. :) Came safely packaged and in great condition.
1,Gigantic : the story of the author's ego (0 stars),"This is the worst biography ever published. The author is not clever or witty as i'm sure he believes himself to be. (he refers to himself as ""Gigantic"" in the 3rd person; what else needs to be said?) Clever if you consider that he's probably making money from the sale of this book on the strength of a great subject (pixies) and a cool cover. In addition to having no interviews with the band that weren't lifted from other sources, half of the book isn't even about the pixies. Every other chapter of this book is a short fictional work about a fan who becomes obsessed with Charles Thompson (Frank Black). This is just a cheap bait & switch to increase the thickness of the book and make it appear as if the author actually has something worth saying. Trust me no pixie fan, no matter how huge, could possibly find anything of value in this book."
1,0 Stars..... Not Recommended!!!!!!,"My 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend's house yesterday. SHe had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt. After a trip to the ER and the Orthopedic Surgeon, she has a fracture in her growth plate. Need I say more?"
2,Excellent reading,"One of Mr Saul's best. It was a hard book to put down, always wanting to know what was going to happen next."
2,Worth waiting for,"This album was well worth the wait. I've been hooked on Numan since first hearing Pure. I hadn't been familiar with his work before that and, although I appreciate his early artistry, am a fan of his recent work from Exile forward. This album was NO disappointment. If you've fallen for the dark, brooding melodies and lyrics, the layers of wave over wave of genius it takes to produce such perfectionistic sound, the way his music can carry you emotionaly to another place that isn't always comfortable and yet croons in absolute suduction...then you CANNOT pass this album over."
2,Classic Compilation,"Baby Bash's classic compilation, Before He Got to be Huge (Suga,Suga). A Must for Baby Bash Fans"
2,MECHANICAL TRIBAL,"VERY HYPNOTIC, ''ADJUST ME'' IS A LITTLE DISJOINTED,STUTTER, THAT INVIGORATES AND MAYBE WE ARE THE MACHINES AND WE NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.BUT THIS IS A WONDERFUL LISTENING EXPERIENCE THE AUDIO GENERATORS HUM OSCILATORS SOOTHE TOO, LIKE HAPPY BEAMMING STAR CRYSTALS. METAL MADE SHIMMERING.LIKE A GOOD SHEPPARD, STONED ASLEEP AND DREAMING.."
1,Huge waste of $$$$$$,"I wanted a safe alternative to the shock collar. this certainly was not it!!! I have an older Dachie mix rescue dog. He hates cats (which I own 2) I'm trying to break him of this habit of barking and going after them. The problem with the collar is that it sprays him with every little sound he makes. He makes some deep sounds (not barking or growling) more like ""talking"". so between those sounds and the barking, the collar continuously sprays him. He also figured out if he turns his head, he doesnt get sprayed. At least with a shock collar it differentiates between just sound and barking. the worst part....this collar can not be returned. So now I'm out over $35.00 for something that I cant even use.do not recommend this at all."
1,Mistake.,"This umbrella is a waste of money and a piece of garbage.I unfortunately lost what seems to be a great umbrella that's just not made anymore and purchased this one. Mistake. I had to re-glue the tips on to the frame of the umbrella in two spots, twice.Would never purchase this brand again.ShedRain. It's the way to go. Lesson learned."
1,I agree!!!,I plugged in the handsfree to my c417 and had my ear blown out by a blaring screech. Trash!!
1,poorly researched,"Have read a lot of the reviews of this book, and no one seems to notice how disappointing the flashbacks are. Grafton has not done her homework! 1)Little houses, even the newer ones, did not have showers in 1953; only wealthy people had such luxuries, we ordinary folk had bathtubs, only. 2)Television sets could not be carried into the schools for all the kids to watch; they were much too large and too heavy, besides they had to be hooked up to an antenna on the roof! Schools didn't have such things in 1953 (I went to school in Calif around that time.) 3)Don't get your ""panties (or undies) in a wad"" was not colloquial phrase in those days. It is much more recent. There are lots of other ""gaffes"" but those three stand out. Reading the book became a hunt for mistakes instead of a good story read."
1,BORING....................,"The only reason I bought this game is because it had this so called ""game of the year"" thingy. You can't even attack, whats up with that. I'm a big boy, I can fight for myself I don't need the Xbox doing it for me. After an hour all I got done was making my stupid charater then I found out that you can't attack. Practicly the whole game is talking, talking, talking It's like The Social gathering game gone wrong. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy it. Its a total waste. Da** u Lucas arts."
2,"Funny, sexy, and realistic","When Bull Durham came out, it set the gold standard for baseball movies. The funny thing about it, though, is even if you are not a baseball fan, this is a movie to see. The writing, the direction, and the acting all are top notch in this movie, which is funny and tocuhing. Susan Sarandon is stunning and may have turned in the years best performance as a ""baseball Annie"" with both looks and a brain. Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins are great and the supporting cast is terrific. The DVD is wonderful, with good colors and delightful extras. The commentary with Costner and Robbins is a lot of fun. This is one DVD that will be a great addition to anyone's collection."
2,"Finally, A Good Alien Environment!","Most film makers cheat on sci-fi by trying to make us believe that a desert scene with a colored gel taped to the camera should pass muster as another planet. Twohy goes the extra mile here, creating believable outdoors scenes, good characters, and great monsters. A real winner that will hopefull put the makers of the Alien series on their toes."
2,Ten Stars - This will knock your socks off,"I kept hearing bits of this recording on a French jazz station but could never quite catch who the artist was. Thank God for Amazon, because here it is. If you love this type of Django-Jazz, you will be blown away. Musician friends of ours have sat in our living room listening to this CD in complete awe; the energy, musicianship, and sheer joy of playing comes through on this CD in a way that I've yet to experience. I can't say enough about it. These are superb musicians - it just doesn't get any better than this."
1,New Age story telling,"I expected this book to be about what people felt were supernatural interventions in their lives for safety, etc., but it turned out to be more New Age philosophy."
1,Every fine author lays an egg now and then,"We have seen it a million times: no matter how good you are, no matter how excellent your editors are, no matter what talent you have; every now and then a fine author turns out a loser. Violin is.Too bad. Anne Rice is excellent and her previous books have been image-filled, lush, unique and had that keep-'em-up-at-night quality. Violin, on the other hand, plays much like a concert you didn't particularly want to go to on a Friday night after a hard week. It puts you to sleep."
2,"What version is the real one? Not this one, for sure.","That's strange! I've seen recently RICH AND FAMOUS on TCM Channel and it was the full version. The scene on the plane between Jacqueline Bisset and Michael Brandon was complete, and the nude scene between Matt Lattanzi and Bisset in the hotel room was also showed as it was filmed originally. How can it be that the DVD version is severely butchered and the cable show is not? Let`s hope that the film will be released on DVD in the future on its uncut version. I`ll wait till then."
2,"A Wonderful, Informative Children's Book","My daughter, who is 4, loves bumble bees. She was attracted to the cover of this book so we first took it out of our library to see. It is written both as a basic story, and then with some more scientific facts as well. When you read it aloud you can choose to read the scientific tidbits along with the bumble bee, life-cycle story, or you can skip them until next time. We both enjoyed learning about the Queen Bee and her life, especially what happens in wintertime. The pictures are detailed and beautiful. You actually get to see the bumble's long, sticky tongue. A great book for kids interested in bees and nature and their parents too!"
1,Stopped working...twice,I bought this iPod audio system. The first one stopped working within 5 weeks. The replacement stopped working within 1 week. Forget it. Find something else.
1,Swizz needs to change hiz beatz!,"I don't know how many times Swizz can use the same beats, but just add a different hook. Swizz snapped when he first came out, but after a while, you get tired of hearing the same thing over, and over again. He didn't hook DMX up on his last CD, and he f--cked-up Drag-on's debut album. He needs to change it up, or stop. I must admit that ""Twisted Heat"" by Twista & Drag-On is tyte, but Swizz needs some new Beatz."
2,No problems so far,"Pretty good cassette adapter. For home stereos, make sure the ""this side up"" side is facing the tape window of the stereo. The adapter has 4 cord exit points so you can change it depending on how your car stereo works. The sound is alright. Just keep the tape head clean and you shouldn't have too much distortion. There's a very faint humming noise when nothing is being played but I believe it's my cars stereo [I tried it in another car and the sound is A LOT better with no hums/distortion]. I think this adapter is very good just for MP3 players [or any other non-standard player for the car stereo]. If you wanna play CDs, definitely buy a CD system for the car, it's well worth the investment. Overall, I'm happy with the adapter."
1,Best of Grant Green,"Although this book covers quite a few of Grant Green's work, It primarily only covers the solos. Instead the chords are only listed and not charted. From my experience there are several chord voicings to choose from and it takes a lot of time to look at the solos and find the correct voicings. I have purchased Hal leonard products in the past and they were much more comprehensive.This is a good book if you just want a little insight into Grants Greens music. But an authentic recorded version of some of his better works would be much better."
2,great movie,"for all people who are for gun control should watch this movie,had the finnish not had the civilan guard the russians would have run right over them.to this day all people from the age of 18 to 52 must serve and keep weapons as i understand it.it's also a time in our history were we should hang our heads in shame because we stood by when they asked our help and we refused.a great movie for a courages country.my deepest respect to the finnish.i also recommend reading the book The Winter War"
1,small Child sized/ or extra small head and or no hair,"I guess if you have a tiny head and no hair this might fit. Otherwise this is too small. But, If you have no hair, then why would you need this? It hurts getting it on and off, and is simply too small."
1,works ok,"Only problem is magnet is almost worthless, which is the whole purpose for a one man job. Otherwise works fine."
2,oh my I love this stuff,I buy the big one 6.7oz for my son he can always smell good for me and his wife truely loves it too...never a disappointment for sure
2,Disturbing and overwhelming,"I deeply enjoyed the first album but it had a number of catchy tracks (Hitler in my Heart, The Rapture, Blue Angel) that pulled me in. As previous reviews have mentioned, ""I am a Bird Now"" takes a turn to the low-key, but the album more than surpasses his first effort. A skeleton of song and voice, this album is powerful, disturbing and incredibly overwhelming. One listen will not suffice, give it some time, you'll fall in love."
2,A Family Standard,We have enjoyed many recipes from this cookbook. Most of the dishes are quick and easy. Our least favorites are the desserts and the tuna fish casserole. I purchased this copy to give to my daughter and her husband. It is a family tradition.
1,Generic&Corny,"heard things about this film&I though it might have more to it but basically what is different between this film&freaky Friday? same type of concept&film. it's also a Insult to compare this film to Tom Hank's ""Big"" which was a Coming of Age Film for Hanks. Jennifer Garner is foxy chick,but Her Acting skills lets say are average at best. I also get so tired of all of these type of movies using the 80's music as there backdrop.they turn film into a Mini Music video as to a actual film."
1,What happened to character development and believable plots?,"I must say, when I first saw that my church library had picked up a new Janette Oke book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, by the end of the book, I was just glad that I had gotten it from the library and hadn't laid down good money for this dreadful piece of under developed, boring waste of paper!! Not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Janette Oke. All I can ask is...how can writers who ""scribble off"" (to use another reviewer's well put description) fluff like this actually sell books? I'd like to warn you against buying this book, and if you still want to read it, get it from the library!"
2,"Great Product, one minor issue though","Love Maglite flashlights, only had one minor issue with this one. I don't normally write reviews, but wanted to share this for anyone else who has this problem. The flickering/won't turn on problem very well could be the tailcap assembly (screw off back part). There are 2 metal clips that need to make contact with the barrel. If your AA LED Maglite is not turning on, try bending these 2 clips out and make sure they can make contact with the barrel. Mine had this problem, and once I bent these clips out it has worked just great. I hope this helps someone out there."
1,Whats The Authority Here?,"I must say Bill here is a whole lot more polished than Rick. There are some Wonderfully insightful tools in this book. Unfortunately, the Authority here is not Scripture. Ministry Experience is the Authority. Calling this ""new wave"" the work of the Holy Spirit is Diceptive. You Cannot seperate the Holy Spirit from the Scriptures. They do not work seperately or contradict each other. But, you don't have to take my word for it. Just be a Berean."
2,Great music!,You can never go wrong with James Blunt! Great heart felt music. Easy listening. I would buy this cd 1000xs !!!!
1,Answering recording,The recording quality for the ansering feature is very poor. The sound is fuzzy no matter how close or far away you try to record from the speaker.
2,"Cute, but not as big as I'd like","This baker is really chic and goes w/ the retro style of my kitchen perfectly, but I should've gone with a size larger. It's so cute I want to show it off to friends, but I can't fit the main course into this dish if I'm serving more than 4. (if people want seconds, it's only good for 3 people.)"
1,load of cr#@$!,"Besides this book being written with juvenile flair,it's obvious to us who know better that it's nothing more than a throw together with a catchy selling title.Anyone who is well informed on this subject will easily spot the rampant bias and shaby research.Mr. Rigg should go back and review his account of the Wannsee conference.At no point in the minutes of the W. conference is there talk about murder or extermination or anything else.Perheps Mr. Rigg should take up a career in fictional novels?I wouldn't even bother with this book."
1,Very shallow pop philosophy,"I tried very hard to like this book but was quickly turned off by Dr. Dyer's protrayal of ""low level"" and ""high level"" frequencies that supposedly mirror different qualitative levels of thought. From these essentially unsupported constructs, he provides advice for living as if the entire structure is an a priori given. The commentary is very shallow bordering upon new age pop psychology. I found very little depth in the first one hundred and twenty pages and finally gave up on the book. If you are interested in something much more substantial and helpful, study more well thought out Zen or Buddhist texts that provide much more substance but do a much better job of conveying the ideas that I believe Dr. Dyer is trying to share."
1,Eh! Well beyond it's prime now...,"This was a great tool years ago, but Ulead got bought by Corel and now they only offer a full DVD image/video packaged named DVD MovieFactory with much more capabilities.Corel DVD MovieFactory 6.0 Plus"
1,Could be a great product if it worked,The first unit that I received was replaced by HP Technical Support because it froze and required a reset almost daily. My second unit turns itself on for a reminder and never shuts off causing the battery to completely drain and erase all of my information and settings. HP Tech Support attempted to blame 3rd party applications for my trouble but I haven't even installed any Microsoft software. I am hanging in there with high hopes for the new version of Pocket PC.
2,North Dallas Forty,The book was a Christmas gift and arrived in a very timely manner. The recipient has already read the book. It was in excellent shape. Thank you!
2,Different,Very original. I've never read any book that contained the same basis of fantasy as this book. The warrior enters the body to fight against the demons. There was a lot of intregue and even a hint of mystery. I especially liked seeing the characters grow. The character of the prince was extremely well rounded. My only complaint was that it dragged just a little bit in a couple of areas.
2,"Not the best season, but still AWESOME!!","I bought this season of Alias after having seen it a few times already. I had all the other seasons, and when I got my husband watching them, we decided to complete the collection. It isn't the best season of this series, but that is perhaps personal preference. We have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not really appropriate for kids, but if you're looking for an addictive season, this is it. You'll stay up nights watching ""just one more episode"" and ""just one more."""
1,So-So-At-Best Screwball,"I guess the reason I had never heard of these particular screwball films is that they are very forgettable. These films are nothing better than okay. The plots are very lame in my opinion. I was so looking forward to watching these films, but after viewing them, it felt like a wasted evening."
1,You have to be stubborn to finish this book,"In Maine, as I write this, it is ""Mud Season"", which was an appropriate time, as it turned out, for me to read Dark Lady. It appears that Richard North Patterson is going through his Mud Season period with this effort. I agree with those that point out that he is unable to write convincingly in the mind of a woman. I agree with those who have said that the plot of this book is confusing at times; that the characters are not fleshed out and in the end you really don't give a damn about Stella or the problems and issues she is dealing with. In a word, it is a tedious read. I have usually enjoyed this writer. Many of his earlier novels were first rate, but this is not one of them. I hope that the next effort will be more succesful and that he gets back to the type of writing he is clearly capable of."
2,Not Your Mother's Freud,"If you're a fan of dramatic art, ripping fast cars packed to the gunwales with gleaming blue steel and gleamier women, get this book. As a feminist, I hate it. As an artist, I'm an addict.This is why I have a therapist. Go get your own.The dedication:""What do I ask of a painting? I ask it to astonish, disturb, seduce, convince."" ~ Lucien Freud.This is NOT your mother's Freud."
1,Good Sound - BADDDD Durability/1 Year Warranty?,"I used these a couple of days a week. However, I would always ensure they were properly wrapped up. Either way, the black casing on the ends started to retreat, exposing the wires. Now, they will not work at all. And what is worst, I have only had these a little more than a year, so the warranty is not good any more."
2,Unsung Missionary Heroes,"We hear lots of things about the ""famous"" missionaries, but there are loads of missionaries out there doing the same pioneering work to spread the gospel. This book is a collection of stories about a missionary doctor and his work in the late 1800s, shortly after the civil war in the US, in India, in an area that is now Hyderabad and the regions around Andhra Pradesh. Having visited there in Sept 2008, much has not changed, and a good portion of this area is still third world. The people are still warm and kind, with the same thirst for knowledge that this missionary found. It was a fascinating exploration into the early work as the gospel of Christianity was brand new to them. I wondered as I read it if any of the places I visted were churches that may have been established by his work. It was quite inspiring."
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work","These bowls would be great if they worked. We've had these bowls for 2 years and they never stick to a tray for more than a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Just when I let my guard down they'd come loose and were easy for a little one to fling across the room. With regular bowls parents wouldn't expect them to stick in the first place and would be more prepared. (The lids on these bowls are very difficult to snap and unsnap, so I'd recommend another set of bowls entirely.)"
2,Microwave Splatter Screen,Nice little product that works well in helping to keep my microwave clean. I bought one for my daughter as well.
1,Beach Music may be the worst book that I have ever read.,"So much of this book was unbelievable, beginning with the characters' names - Ledare, Shyla, Tee, John Harlan, Dallas - what kind of names ARE those? The scene with the four friends lost at sea for two weeks was completely unbelievable, and became laughable when the boys were rescued by holding on to the antler of a swimming deer that led them home. The scene where Jack was in the hospital bathing his mother and shampooing her hair because she had become violently ill;shouldn't he have called a nurse? It's frightening that such a book could become a best seller."
2,Now feel safe working 30 feet up,"Bought this for my super-tall house ladder. Working 30 feet above the ground never felt so secure. Standoff is the perfect size to keep the ladder off of the gutters while putting up Christmas lights. I could finally string lights right past the ladder without moving the ladder! The biggest plus is that the ladder is rock solid once in position. The big con is that, extending a 30 foot ladder with this attached is impossible without a second person due to the topheavy load this puts on the ladder. I'd give it the 5th star if it could somehow be lighter."
1,Don't waste another dime!,"I have a Z82. I have had problems similar to those of other reviewers. Especially the ridiculously expensive ink cartridges running dry after minimal usage. I'm done buying cartridges, and I'll never buy another Lexmark product again. I'll just use the Z82 as flatbed scanner and move on."
1,Blech.,"What an incredibly bad and BORING book. I usually trust Roberts to tell a good story, but this book raised serious doubts for me. These characters are underdeveloped, BORING and I didn't care about any of them at all. ""End of the world"" - YAWN. I am not even tempted to buy the rest of the trilogy. And Roberts' habit of big, bloated speeches was bad in the last ""Red"" flower books; I'm assuming that no editor's curtailed her because it's just awful here. I just wanted everyone to shut UP with the big, long-winded declarations. And I'm annoyed that the person that, ah, not ends up not being part of the group, is that person. Talk about the final cliche in a book chock full of them."
1,item is described inaccurately,"Received, but was disappointed that it is Kwikset Security, not Kwikset MAXIMUM Security as described. There is a big difference between the two."
2,Great starter for understanding quantum theory and string theory,Lots of examples and detailed information to help understand the principals of general relativity and quantum mechanics. I liked the information about how our micro and macro universes compare and how they differ.
1,"Waste of Paper, Time, Effort, etc. etc. etc","A recent positive review compared this series to a chess match, moving all the pieces in place.What a load of tripe! This would have to be the slowest, longest, poorest played chess match in history.If you like endless description of what the characters are wearing, with little if any plot advancement, then this book is for you. Or if you want to read pages detailing the washing of silk (Who on earth reading a novel wants this?), read on brave reader. Perhaps an aid to sleep is what this book really should be marketed as.If you want to read great fantasy (as opposed to poor) read George RR Martin. There's honestly no comparison. Martin's work, as opposed to this mess, is focused, dramatic, exciting, has evolving characters, and is fun to read."
2,"Finnegans Wake: Not Just a Book, and Experience","I'm 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best book I've ever read. I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine. GET THIS BOOK NOW!"
1,This IS A VERY Distrubing movie.,The ending IS HEART-BREAKING and lingers with you for a long time after watching it. (Maybe I'm just too sensitive(?). It went to an area thrift shop after two watchings.
2,"Good product, but could be better","I owned an older model of this product and it sounded great. I broke the mic, I decided to get the newer one. The first one had a bad ear piece. Amazon sent a replacement right away. The replacement works great when it's positioned properly. If not, the speakers click on and off. Other than that, it sounds great. And I can't break the mic since it's in the headphone itself."
1,I will never ever use ATT/Cingular even if they pay me!!,"I'm in Boston/Cambridge area and getting dropped calls, busy network, dead spots all--the--time!!! BTW, I get 24% discount on my monthly fee through my wife's company and I will definitely switch regardless the signifcant savings."
2,a Thrilling intro to Pink Martini,"I first saw/heard of PM on PBS, I'm sure many others are Same.(much as I 'hate' to say it) IF you haven't seen Pink Martini in person (me X 3) YOU HAVEN'T LIVED.THEY WILL ROCK YOU, they will lay you down in the aisles.they look good, they Sound FABULOUS, and they will leave you WANTING MORE.(anything else I could say would take away from the description)"
2,a Stranger's Heart,Absolutely wonderful movie. Am very happy with the speed that I received this DVD. Will definitely order from this business again.
2,The best violin player in the world.,The legendary violin player shows here deep feelings through standards. It takes you to New York...like you were there....
2,"For all Wagnarians and the people just getting to know Wagner, THIS DVD is a MUST. Most informative .",A recording of such a scale is revealed in this DVD. Only down side is that the Decca people didn't record the first session but what you'll experiance in the last is worth every penny!
1,Disappointing mistakes throughout the book,"What a disappointment. I'm taking the test tomorrow, and I fear for my grade. Having worked with Oracle8i since its release, I was just looking for a quick read to brush up on the breadth of topics in the exam, and get reaquainted with the exam style for the Oracle tests. Boy I sure started with the wrong book. The amount of technical errors are astounding, particularly in the exam questions! In addition, the exam questions are poorly written and do not appear to have any relation to the style I will expect on the test. Wish me luck, and steer away from this title."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"2 stars may be a bit harsh--but I was sooooo disappointed. His Holiness the Dalai Lama does not need Howard Cutler as an interpreter -- his ideas are elegant and eloquent -- and can stand beautifully alone in their simplicity. From the cover, I thought the Dalai Lama wrote the lion's share -- but Cutler was entirely too present to satisfy me."
2,"Not cheap, just inexpensive","This product is really quite good for the price. Sure maybe the battery life could be longer, and the instructions could be clearer as they are written in poor english, but overall this product delivers.It works without flaw with WMP11 also which is good for me. Though one slight drawback is it only holds 99 songs in a folder, so you have to create different folders to make full use of it. Still its far better than creating CD's and lugging around a portable CD player. This fits in my pocket nicely. Plus it has come in handy since my CD player in the car quit working, rather than get a new player for the card, I simply got a cigarette lighter FM transmitter and I'm enjoying my tunes with this little device.Highly recommend if you can to pick one of these up. Its a far better value than any name brand out there for what it can do. Heck it even can do voice recording or simply be used as a thumb drive for transporting other files.What more could you ask for under $50."
1,Please Don't Buy... SAFTEY HAZARD,"Hey, Please DON'T BUY if you have ANY KIND OF HILL! My mom was using it on a hill and guess what, Her Tractor FLIPPED because of the collector and luckily she ONLY BROKE HER ARM! The Troy-Built tractor is pretty much Totaled! The front fell off. The Deck wheels bend totally, and the Bagger is totaled fully! Please, DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF HILL!...So much of a $300 Birthday Present"
2,Sarah Connor Second Season Rocks!,"If your a fan the second season is a ""must see"", I enjoy having the DVD set because it is worth the re-watch from time to time. In reference to the series, I was very disappointed when it was cancelled, season two ends in a bizarre manor that leaves you saying.... WTF? Other than the disappointing ending, I love it and recommend it as a ""must have""!"
1,"Works, but not as well as I would have hoped","I bought this originally because I had seen it used before. It worked so well, and my dog sheds quite a bit, so I was hoping to have the same success. However, it doesn't remove as much hair as I saw when originally used, and you have to press pretty hard to remove excess. Also, unless my dog is wet, it removes barely any hair. Quite disappointing."
1,WHO KNOWS,"...I couldn't watch any more of this ridiculous shlocker after the first ten minutes. The acting goes beyond awful.....so if it's good, I'll never know!!!"
2,Happy we were able to get in a narrow size.,We have ordered a pair of these shoes from Amazon three times before and have been happy with their durability. This time we were able to get these in a narrow fit which have been perfect for our tall yet very thin daughter. Again we feel this was a great buy.
2,Helpful Little Book,"Respected pastor-theologian, John Piper, referred to this book. A very high view of marriage is put forth and defended. Worthwhile reading."
1,Total Garbage,"I bought this exact model in 2002 for boot camp. i thought i should get the best quality watch for something like that and since it is the navy seal watch i figured it would be pretty good. for daily use it looks cool and lights up insanely bright at night. you would have no trouble telling the time in the dark. now the bad part... on the way to boot camp, the light strip on the second hand fell off! it just rattled around inside. then i got to boot camp and i cracked the face without even abusing the freaking thing. it made me sick knowing how much this stupid watch cost me. i ended up having to go to the store so i could buy a [...] timex ironman watch. i used it through boot camp and still wear it today after 7 years of abuse. i had to change the battery for the first time about a month ago. i say dont waste your money. this watch isnt all that luminox claims it to be. its absolute crap."
2,Action packed. A must for Han Solo fans.,"This book was beautiflly writen. i want Han and Bria get together soooooooo bad, and they finnlly did. this book was great, the best of all three."
1,Not a hit with our daughter,"Stiff suspension, not bouncy at all. Might be scary for babies who are already mobile and like exploring independently. Our 9mo seemed excited at first but quickly became frightened as she realized she was tethered to a fixed spot. She's used to cruising and crawling. Wanted to encourage her to bounce by moving it for her, but it's not springy at all. She's terrified of it."
1,Been Two Months,"I wish I could give the video 5 stars, but unfortunately I can't. The reason being is that I didn't even receive the mercandise. I have tried to contact the seller, but that didn't work. They can't even provide me with the tracking number! I believe that it is something wrong with that picture. I have even requested a refund, but they still stick to their story of it being sent. I am very upset and if you do not wish to waste your time and money, I suggest you look elsewhere for a good video."
2,Buy This Disk,"I love this group so much, that I've bought several copies of their disk to give to friends. It seems that every time I've seen them, it's yet another incredible, magical experience. I can't wait till the next disk is released!"
1,Horrible quality,"If you are buying this as a toy then its perfect. If you are buying this for a young person taking lessons, forget it. The bridge fell off immediately. The pins do not hold the strings taught. Poor quality overall. I do not recommend for a lesson taker."
2,The best of the series,"This book is the best of the hard to find Trixie Belden series. Trixie and Honey find a diamond in the Wheeler's gatehouse. Convinced the thief is still around, Trixie tries to find him. Though a bit slow, the characters are so well defined and have such a good time I've read this one more than any others. In this book , we first meet Brian and Mart and they form the BWG's. If you can get a copy of this one, it's well worth it."
1,gets worse and worse,"The first time I bought J-14 was in 2010. From there to now it has gotten from good to horrible! Seriously the stories are very shallow, they focus on crushes and celebrities . They are boring and I don't recommend it to anyone."
2,Way better than the movie,One aspect of this book that is undermentioned is the impact of having a hellish boss. I read this book when I was in that situation and it helped me have some laughs along the way. Other than that it is a little fantasy land to drift off to on a vacation. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend is truly examined in the book - a major piece that was likely left out of the movie due to timing.
1,"Unreadable, Obtuse","I bought this book to learn about World History, in order to comprehend todays world a bit better. Last night I gave up. I made it to page 429. I scanned ahead to WWII to see if it would improve. It did not. I am 62, and have an advanced degree. The reading is just incomprehensible. As others have stated you have to read some paragraphs several times to understand what the author is trying to say. It is obtuse to the nth degree. An example: he uses the words ""Anatolia"" and ""Levant"" without defining them anywhere in the entire book. I learned more from looking up these words online and reading about them in a miniscule fraction of the time I've spent reading the book. The maps are atrocious. All in grayscale and extremely difficult to tell one gray shade from another. The text on most of the maps is unreadable. I do not recommend this book."
2,great instrumental,I have not heard any Cusco that is bad. One of the best instrumental groups in existance playing music that can be enjoyed by anyone since there are no lyrics to interpret. If you listen to this one you will want the rest.
1,Daniel,"This movie has great content. The authors had a great idea on relating the movie content to todays problems. However, poor animation doesn't appeal to modern sofisticated kids (my kids are not going to watch it again). The animator have used dark gloomy colors. There is almost no motion in the scenes. The content also is best suitable to older kids (> 8 years old or older). On the other hand, adults may like it."
1,Blah.,"Just one word. Blah. It's hard to understand, creepy, and disgusting. If you're like me, just tring this book to make yourself feel brave, forget it. I recommend The Name Of This Book Is Secret, or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(Remember to not get the original book) In the long and short, this book is @&?#%$!"
1,The subtitles are invisible much of the time,"The subtitles are invisible much of the time because they are all-white (with no frames around the letters), so they become invisible against the background. (The movies in itself is amusing, with excellent acting.)"
1,"File under Trash, not Thrash","Worst Megadeth album. End of story. Don't waste your money. Get the remastered MD.45-The Craving(with Dave on vocals!) instead. I bought Risk when it first came out and I wanted to cry. If this was the direction they were headed, I would see what Metallica was doing at that time then. Luckily, they got over that creative goof and started putting out the slammin' music again. If you are new to the band, here is your mission:Peace Sells, But Who's BuyingRust in PeaceCryptic WritingsThe World Needs a HeroKilling is my Business and Business is GoodBuy these first and listen to them until they are worn out. Then:The System has FailedYouthanasiaCountdown to ExtinctionAnd:So Far, So Good, So WhatThis last one was when they were all pretty blasted on drugs and basically made the record to support the habit. It shows in the music and the new drummer and guitarist are lousy.Avoid Risk at all costs. Even if it's offered to you for free or given to you by Aunt Fanny at Christmas."
1,Useful as a doorstop,"John Hodgman is an accomplished writer and has good comedic sense and timing, so why did he release this truly awful book? I'd accuse the editor of malpractice, but there is no evidence an editor was ever involved. Maybe the joke is on us, the people who foolishly purchased this wad of paper and ink. My only consolation is I bought the paperback."
2,great book,This book describe how to change your thinking or views on situation that most people are not raise with. This book has help me to stop and think and make changes about myself. Which has helped with how I react in my marriage. I am reading it over just to keep the advise in my thoughts so I don't go back to my old habits of thinking.
1,too short & low budget,This adaptation has 2 problems; it is too short. The first part with Jane's childhood and her aunt can have a whole chapter. The second at Lowood school needs another whole chapter. Important literary characthers like Mr. Brocklehurst & Miss.Temple are barely seen or left out.This novel has a lot of psicological evolution with Jane and Mr.Rochester that simply needs more screen time.Second problem is a modest or low budget;cinematography is too dark and poor. Few fill and background light is used so characthers are not separated from the background.
1,Plastic Parts Break Easily,"The jig broke the first time I adjusted the hinge size. The small plastic teeth which hold the gauge in the slot broke clean off one minute after I took the jig out of the package. Twenty seconds later it was in the garbage. Buy something made of metal. It looked like a 50 cent tool, and performed like it."
2,Perfect every time,This book was a lucky find for me. It's difficult to find a book with recipes that turn out well the first time you make them but this book has saved me countless times when cooking for a crowd due to its recipes that are universally enjoyed (sometimes difficult to accomplish with a roomful of guests) and very easy to follow. I think the Strata might be my favorite so far. Highly recommended...
1,Very tinny sound,"I bought this to replace a 40+ year old Panasonic AM transister radio that I've listened to every morning for many many years, but it died recently. Of old age, I assume. I've always trusted Sony to make quality products so I didn't hesitate to buy this radio when I saw it was made by Sony. The sound quality is pretty bad - very tinny, much worse than my old radio. I can't hardly stand to listen to it in the morning, it is irritating at best. I only use it for the AM news - can't imagine how FM music must sound on it and don't want to find out. As soon as I can find another one that is small enough and battery operated, I'll donate this Sony to Goodwill. Very disappointed."
1,Beware - Soup explodes in microwave,"Not a good soup for the microwave. Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues. I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel. Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave."
1,Returned twice....,"I was not satisfied with this product, no fault of Amazon, but from the manufacturer. When i received it and opened it up, there was a residue on the clear plastic front of the rainforest soother. I tried to clean it off(couldn't really tell if it was on the outside of the plastic front or inside) but it would not come off. I shipped it back to Amazon and within days they had a replacement out to me. But, on the replacement, it had the same issue, so i mailed it back again and Amazon promptly refunded me. I ended up finding this toy at a local store(although at a higher price) that did not have the residue on it. So, while i'm unhappy with having to go through the trouble of returning it twice, Amazon did a good job getting me a replacement then a refund very quickly. The Rainforest soother is great-i bought it for one of my twins(the other has the fisher price aquarium) and he LOVES it!!"
1,Horrible,"We tried this monitor for the first time during nap time in his crib as he currently still sleeps in a bassinet in our room. The monitor did NOT pick up any noise, not even his stuffed toy that sings. The static just being in the next room was so loud we had to turn down the volume, but then didn't hear him when he was crying. My husband went in the room, talked and messed with the monitor and it didn't pick up anything. This will be returned. (yes we tried batteries, plugging it in, checking channels and different positions)"
1,"Oh, kandi...",this album was not good at all. there were only two tracks that I can actually listen to; don't think I'm not and I wanna know. I heard the group is supposed to be getting back together. I hope so because they make good music together. 2 stars for the 2 tracks of the cd I paid almost $20 for.
1,Too Much to Swallow,"This highly touted book did not appeal to me at all. The lessons are depressing, overbearing, and contained too much negative information for me. Each ""lesson"" leads me to feel that I will never be able to turn my circumstances around, and I get upset just thinking about picking it up and resuming reading it. The ""lessons"" are just too harsh, too time consuming, too much work, requiring time and focus that a busy career woman just does not have. Obviously written by a man, for men. Maybe I'm just not ready for it. Not one of the ""successful"" people mentioned in the book by the author is a female!!! Go figure!"
1,Great to watch if you're on drugs!,"My husband bought this DVD for me, thinking it was live performances. Well, when we started watching it I decided the graphics were probably meant for people who are high at a party. Don't get me wrong, the music is fine, but to watch a lot of the videos made me dizzy. I love U2 and have for 20 years. But come on, this DVD should have a warning sign on it! Don't view if you're sober or conservative."
2,stuntman,"this game is wicked!It has superb graphics, and is very easy to play.There are plenty of levels to play and the price is good value for money!!!"
2,Hanoi does ROCK,"This album Rocks. This is the one to get. Ive been listening to this album since around 1985 and it rocks. The drummer of the band ""Razzle"" was the guy that was with Vince Neil who got killed in the DUI accident. Anyway ive listened to their other albums but this one is the best. If I had to pick 10 records (cd's) to be on an island by myself forever This one would be highly concidered as one of them. Thats how I rate my music."
1,Wireless speakers- do not work,"Got these speakers for my son as a holiday gift. They worked great and easy to set up in his apartment. After 3 weeks, they stopped working, had lots of interference and just were very poor quality. Had to return and buy a more expensive set, that is of much higher quality"
1,WARNING - doesn't run on laptops,it would have been nice if lucas arts had bothered to tell us that this will not run on laptops. you can't upgrade the graphics card on a laptop to enable you to run it either. I have a 2GB PC but this still won't run! REgardless of your views on the game - don't buy it if you have a laptop
2,This is not what I expected,This is not what I expected at all. I love kaleidoscope quilts but this was not complete and it was not as pretty as I expected
2,An Excellent Reagan Primer,"As the pundits and revisionists attempt to rewrite the history of his presidency, those who know Reagan continue to demontstrate the effect this great man had on them and history. This book is an excellent introduction into how Reagan the Man affected Reagan the President. Through examples of how Reagan handled his life, his staff and his faith, Mr. Robinson gives us insight into the inner world of Ronald Reagan. His rock solid faith and conviction flowed through events both personal and public, and changed the very course of history. I will most certainly be buying Reagan's memoir to get more perspective on a man who is without a doubt one of the great presidents of our time."
2,My 1st Cookbook,My mom got me this cookbook when I first moved out into my own apartment. I had no idea how to learn to cook for myself- Taco Bell and Wendy's were the equivilant of a hot meal. I couldn't believe how easy these recipes were to follow! This book saved my life (and my figure!) and I would recommend it to any first time cook.
1,So so,"Pendant size is larger than a quater making it a bit gaudy. The leather cord it comes with would probably not fit over the head of most children, so it's useless."
2,Above All Others,"John Williams, David Russell, Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, et. al. all owe a great deal to this now departed giant. If you own ANY classical guitar recordings, you should purchase this collection. It's not only the finest remastering available, but an equisitely fine selection of Segovia's contribution to the genre and the art."
1,Not as Expected,"I purchased this for my daughter's nursery and was hoping it would complement the vintage rose pink I had already in the room (I was looking for a soft light pink skirt); unfortunately the color has more of a purple hue to it similar to a soft ballerina pink. It also is more princessy/fairytail looking then I thought it would be, an aesthetic I was trying to avoid. If you want to compare the color of the tulle, the light pink bridal tulle at Joanne's Fabric Store is the exact same color (I had some tulle rounds leftover from the baby shower). The third layer of fabric behind the 2 tiered layers of tulle is also a matching light pink cotton/muslin. I tried to see if the color of the crib skirt would change having a white or cream piece of fabric behind the tulle, but both colors made little difference, just a smidgen lighter, but the purple is still there. If you are going for a princess/fairytale or ballerina theme I think this pink crib skirt would complement perfectly."
2,Funny,I think House Of Payne 4 was the best of all. Great Stories and more humour and has not lost its message.Great ending to the series.
1,"Good movie, bad format","For the content of the movie I give it four stars. However, this is a 4x3 cropped version. This appears to be the only format it is available in, so no blame to Amz."
2,"If your hard core furry fan, you'll like this",An excelent book with plenty of worth while pictures in it. but it is not 100% furry though with two of the artists not having a single furry pic in their section
1,Not well written,What an unsatisfactory read.There are several pieces of information that just aren't threaded together. Some of the behaviors of the characters have no motivation.Sad. It couldn've been a great book.
1,Too heavy for its binding adhesive,"I've always liked these magnetic notepads that you can just slap on the fridge. With them, I manage to forget far fewer things when I shop at the grocery store (I'm sure I'll always forget something - with my faulty memory I can hide my own Easter eggs - but since the dawn of magnetic notepads, I don't have those moments where I go to the store just to get milk and come back everything but milk).When I found this notepad, I was pleased, because it is about 1/2"" thick, which means lots of pages so I don't go through pads as often. Wrong. What it meant was that I used a few pages off the top and then the pad fell apart under its own weight. All of the pages fell to the floor in a clump, bound by their overtaxed adhesive binding, leaving the cardboard backing with the magnet sitting proudly and uselessly on my fridge.The pad is now on my kitchen counter and is just enough out of the way that I'm back to forgetting the milk again."
1,3rd dead one,"I got a B70 for Xmas and it kept shutting off on its own, so I returned it for another B70. It had the same problem. Then I found all the reviews that said the B70 was defective, so I tried the B60. Same problem again, it won't brew unless I take out the water reservoir and put it back in. Repeat process for each cup you want to brew. The auto turn on feature doesn't work because of this, so don't expect a hassle free cup of coffee in the morning. Definitely not worth it."
2,New version is great,"This is a more sturdy version than the previous version. Adding words is great. And it doesn't mean that you have to read the words when going through this book. We have all adlibbed, haven't we? It can be just a search book or a read to them book. Use it any way you want. It's great. It's bright, colorful, and holds up to baby's use. There are so many things to talk in this book. A great feature for special needs children is the duck on each page for them to find. Small steps learning."
1,Not worth the money,The CD arrived in excellent conditons and promptly. The merchandise is not worth the money. Too much of the original story is missing in the interest of cramming it in one CD. Will leave you with a lot of questions on how did sherlock homes arrived at his results. Your imagination will not be enough to fill out the gaps in the narrative.
1,A lot of money for a few pictures.,"Don't bother with this one, it's a thin, overpriced volume with only moderately interesting photographs and uninformative captions. Apparently, the publisher intends this as volume one of several, which, given the qualities of this text, sounds like shameless profiteering. The entire catalog of photos, including those yet to be published should have been offered together in a single volume for this price."
1,AWESOME....then it will break.,"I really enjoyed this product... while it lasted. Sadly the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies. It lasted for 7 glorious egg mc muffin-like months THEN it just stopped working. The warranty had expired and I could no longer enjoy the egg goodness. I thought it was unusual and possibly a fluke but after some research I found out that this products failure is quite common. I contacted the company to no avail they did/would not reply. SO in conclusion, great idea, terrible implementation. Oh and USE NON-STICK SPRAY! The low price clearly does not allow for teflon."
1,artsy craftsy,"Not useful. Might be ok for an artsy craftsy person who makes things that are fairly useless, but I was hoping to be able to put together a useful book that was a bit unique. These examples are uniquely unique and impractical."
2,Anne Rivers Siddons books,I love most of Anne Rivers Siddons books and have read every one she has written. She is a great read.
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap...",This device has the durability and quality of a preschool construction project as it broke within the first 3 minutes...no joke. Much better off just getting the Samsung headphones which are made specifically for the Blackjack. They actually work very well.
2,A Special Insight Into Muhammad,"This is a wonderful and in-depth look into Muhammad Ali's life as told by those closest to him.My only complaint is that the chapters ran a bit too long - not in content and not long as in boring or bad/useless information - not that at all. I'm a slow reader and it was simply time consuming to finish each chapter.The chapters are told to you by Ali's friends, family, contemporaries and the man himself.You really get a feeling for Muhammad - the person not just the boxer - through his family, friends and those that know him. I put the book down feeling closer to Muhammad Ali and feeling a warmth from him and a warmth towards those he loves and cares for...I walked away from this book with such great feelings for Muhammad Ali. I felt as if I'd laughed alongside with him - and that alone is worth reading this book"
1,What the heck!,"Okay? I see a lot of great reviews for this game. Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game. I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics! then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive. Plus people say how shinobi looks cool???? I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while. And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics. Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2. This game really blows! It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone. Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short! The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it! Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it. Trust me!"
2,Sony Headphones,"I purchased these headphones to use while working out. Rather than crank the TV so loudly while running on my treadmill or using the elliptical, I thought this may be a good alternative. So far I've had no problems. I place them on the charger after each use so I havn't had an issue with battery life. The sound isn't crystal clear but I'm also moving around quite a bit. They work well for what I bought them for and for the price feel it was a good purchase."
2,The series is in good hands!,"Though I was at first apprehensive about another author taking over my favorite series, but having read this, I can simply say... Keep them coming Todd!"
2,Great Little Item,I bought this for my granddaughter to use on the computers at school. She says it works perfectly and it's a plus that it has a case to keep it free from damage in her backpack. SG
2,My 2rd one,Works great for me the only thing is that the light comes on when pushing something heavy.
2,Keeps the cold out.......,"This product worked better than I expected. We live in an old house with old windows that leak cold air in. I sealed the windows in the winter and then wanted to remove the seal in the summer to install an air conditioner. The caulk came out easily in pretty much one piece. If you may want to remove it later, this is the one to use. I could not find it in any of the usual box stores."
2,Excellent,"Rock Legends land on scene with this album. LZ 2nd album and it is AWESOME! Nuff said, go buy it."
1,Delicious Tea But Be Careful!,"But if you have high blood pressure, skip it!! Even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels. The licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness."
1,FOOOOOZZZZZZZZBBBBBBBBBALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,"It was very EDUCATIONAL it taught me the meaning of life. HERE IS THE MEANING OF LIFE: T. O. GOING DEEP, OHH NO WATCH OUT FOR MY GRANDMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"An excellent, balanced look at the events","If you could read only one book about the OK Corral gunfight, this should be it. There is no attempt to make either group right or wrong; too often these days, one or the other group is portrayed as a set of complete bad guys, when ""complete"" is much too strong a word. There are a few other books that should be considered, Chaput's ""Virgil Earp: Western Peace Officer"", Tanner and DeArment's ""Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait"", and Bob Boze Bell's books on Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. All reach pretty much the same conclusions although there are some variations in viewpoint that will make the reader think (for example, Tanner's view on just who was the target at the Boarding House is intriguing). Anyway, Dr. Marks' book is well-written, with a style that is easy to follow and appreciate. It is my hope that she finds other western subjects to write about so that we may enjoy more of the fruits of her research and writing ability."
2,Spiritually Uplifting!,"I couldn't stop listening to this book. I bought the first audio book because I had a long drive and it looked interesting. Now I have read some of the other reviews, and I don't know if the audio version is that much more ""alive"" but I could feel all the emotions that the characters were going through. At times I forgot that I would not be one of those left behind. This book, and the rest, are going through all my friends' hands. I don't want any of them to be Left Behind. I am so excited to read that there will be 6 more in the series. I will run out and buy each as soon as they hit the bookstores!"
1,Not for my HP430 plotter.,Don't buy the TRENDnet USB to Parallel 1284 Converter for plotters. It doesn't work. Finally got product-maker agent to tell me as much. Packaging doesn't say that it doesn't work for some parallel-port products.
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!,"It is an understatement that this novel was just plain ridiculous! After reading the section about ""what really happened to Hoffa"", I felt like I swallowed a golf shoe. The character suffers the tired old adage...a hit man with a tortured soul. The love scence between the main character and the single mother on the run is straight out of Penthouse Forum. I need to gargle. There is still a bad taste in my mouth! Hint: A little less Dungeons and Dragons and a little more research into the field."
1,Tripe and Punishment,"This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read, from the painstaking reproduction of turgid Victorian poetry to the unbelievably bad and predictable Scooby-Doo ending (A-ha! I knew it was the Professor under the mask all along!) Hundreds of pages of writing, and yet the characters remain caricatures throughout (what do they like? do they have interesting opinions about anything? what do they do when they aren't squabbling with each other?) I cannot recall one compelling sentence in the entire book. It's like trying to chew dust."
1,Was sent the wrong clip,"The company sent me the right case but the wrong clip. I contacted the company and went back and forth with them for a while and I haven't heard from them since. Mistakes happen, but fix them."
1,Not Impressed.,"This product, while being nice on your skin, didn't have a srong or long-lasting fragrance as I would like."
2,"Good diaper, but I still prefer Sam's Member Mark brand","I bought these diapers because of the incredible deal with the Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom discount combo (note: the price has now increased from when I ordered in June). The diapers are ""good"" in that they haven't leaked. They do not get 5 stars for the following reason: They are a little ""flimsy"". So, even if my daughter doesn't need a diaper change due to contents, she needs a diaper change more often because they lose their shape around her and don't cover her well. I did not have this problem with the Sam's Club brand diapers. So, although they were slightly less expensive per diaper, I have ended up using MORE diapers because I have to change my daughter more often. Other than the ""flimsiness"", I like the diapers."
1,Wow... Just Wow...,"I have two primary complaints:1. No serial killer would be this organized or complicated.2. An emo serial killer is the worst idea I've ever heard.I thought Dennis Quaid's acting was decent throughout and good in a few scenes. There are a few shots that are intriguing, particularly the first scene in the film. Other than that, the plot is like trying to swim through pudding and the ending was one of the least satisfying things I've ever seen.Seriously, skip this one.. it'll only make you mad and give you a headache."
1,Constantly resetting this router,"There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. I can be in the middle of surfing, playing games over the net or even mid-download, the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection. The LAN will still be operational, but the internet will suddenly be inacccessible. The support page only offers ""reset everything..."" which is ludicrous. A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually. I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day.I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now. This Netgear is the most finicky/exasperating router I have ever encountered. I will never buy from Netgear again, and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter."
1,Not My First Choice for Fondant,"Actually, Wilton fondant isn't even my 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choice. I have used this fondant for covering cake boards and for figures that will not be consumed, but I would never use this fondant to cover a cake that was going to be eaten as I find the taste of Wilton fondant to be disgusting. There are far too many other brands of fondant out there that are superior in both taste and ease of use to settle for using Wilton fondant."
1,Caution! Read this before using quinine for leg cramps.,"My mother had been taking these and I finally got around to researching it. Please read the links below, including a press release from the FDA, and decide for yourself if the risk outweighs the benefits.http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01521.htmlhttp://www.resource4thepeople.com/defectivedrugs/quinine.html"
1,The Well Went Dry,"A horrific repackaging and rerecording of music that should have stayed in the vaults by a band that should have stuck with the music lessons. If you want to hear ""reel"" Celtic music, stay away from these imposters."
1,Disappointing fifth title....,"I WAS so enthralled with Cliff Janeway's character, his love of books and all that good, good knowledge...that this fifth endeavor of Mr. Dunning's just left me dazed with disappointment.It doesn't matter that I never knew anything about horses and the racetrack (I found that a very interesting aspect) but this entire novel left a lot to be desired on so many levels. I, too, was glad not to have spent any money on this having borrowed it from the library.I can only hope that the next Janeway novel is a vast improvement on all levels over this one. PLEASE! Susan"
2,Love the Peguins,"Even though I was told it had a dent in the spine, it was so small and at the bottom of it that I had to look very close to the book spine to see it. It was in better condition. It also showed up at the given dates."
1,don't do it,"I am a huge Koontz fan. However this was one of the most painful book I have ever read. I did the Kindle version, and it was just page after page of not much print and or story. Interesting concept, but not my fav Koontz title. Sorry, but i can not recommend this at all."
1,Russell and Norvig Exponentially Better,"The title of this review speeks for itself. Unfortunately I had to buy this book (Nilsson) for a course. I still refer to it at times, but only as a last resort. If you have a choice go with Russell-Norvig text."
1,Boarding school adventures,"A 16-year-old Navy brat heads off to the Maryland boarding school her mother and grandmother attended, intent on having a good time and living up to their warm memories of the place. Her hot temper and tendency to dismiss people get her into trouble, but she quickly befriends the class leaders and has a good old-fashioned time learning to ride."
2,Not as good as other books in the series but still fun.,"This is one of the better ones in the Big Book Of Series. It is not a jaw dropper like Big Book of Conspiracies or Big Book of Weird, but it is still a fun read.I was not born until the 80's, but I thought this book was great. I never knew that Kissinger could be an intresting guy. This is all the cool stuff that you never got to see in That 70's Show. From the Son of Sam murders to the Pet Rock and the Brady Bunch it covers the wackiest decade with some amazing art work.I just hope they do a Big Book of the 80's some day."
2,LAMB IS SO PERCEPTIVE AND CLEVER.,"I picked up She's Come Undone from my 16 year old, who bought it because she liked the cover. Even though I thought that she was kind of young for some of the material, it was too late she had already read it. We both found it to be a book that you do not want to put down. Dolores Price is a character I will never forget. How can Wally Lamb understand this woman so well? He is so perceptive and clever. I saw his next book I Know This Much Is True and did not hesitate to buy it. He did not disappoint me. My daughter also read this one. As much as we liked the first, this one was entirely different but just as intriguing. There was a wealth of material but I would not complain because I feel like we got to know everything we needed to know about the Tempesta and Birdsey families. For a week, I missed reading it....like a good friend had left town. Mr. Lamb....you are a born writer.....Thanks so much for sharing your talent with the world. Keep on writing."
2,"BUY THIS ALBUM, SUPPORT SKA-CORE",Just a beautiful CD. This is the kind of genius that comes from Tomas Kalnoky and his bandmates. Catch-22 isn't good anymore because he left. Catch-22's loss is Streetlight Manifesto's gain in this cd.
2,Found Fried Maine Clams,"Here in Texas I can get Maine clams and Lobster, but not the fried clams. The ones I got from Great Gourmet are pretty close to the ""hidden"" clam shacks of NE. When I can't get to NE, these will sure fit the bill.The service was excellent. I recommend this company highly."
1,"Once fully charged, won't hold charge for any length of time.","Ok, I figure, being a Lenmar brand, the battery should hold a charge,but it doesn't.I figure I'll give it a complete charge and discharge a few times and a month to determine how reliable the battery is, before any reviews.After you fully charge it, it will work, but don't expect same power length as your original.Also, if you have it fully charge and let it sit for a week, without use, the battery will show empty, when you try to play it.So if you are going to use it, you must charge it the night before. Kind of a pain.One note, to replace the battery was pretty easy, just watch the videos online, took about 10min."
2,Lovely,"I was very pleased with this CD. The songs are lovely that bring forth the season. It reminds me of listening to my mother's old records at Christmas time long ago. A retro feel with that soothing, relaxing vibe."
2,happy grandma,I started the growing in grace collection for my first grandaughter when she was born and add to it each year on her birthday. I get the blonde series since she is blonde. Each piece is so unique. Love the collection.
1,leaky mess,Overall the product looks very nice but it didn't work well. The sealant that keeps the nectar from leaking was not placed right so after you fill the cylinder with nectar it leaked all over the counter. I would not purchase this product if I could go back. Now I need to put more sealant in order for it to work properly. Thumbs down.
2,I love his whacky humor,I read Lamb. Very funny. This one too. I'm on to the next book. Lighten up and enjoy fun reading. His books are my guilty pleasure.
1,Not that good,"Ok..first off....I've always been a huge Descendents fan. I bought everything they ever put out when it came out...(im old). This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I can't even believe it's them. Very uninspired and uncreative. The lyrics, riffs, energy, and excitement is just not on this record. Why couldn't they be that band that put out the ""ALL"" album? You can argue all you want...but I would bet money that if you like this record you are way under 25 years old. I'll give it two stars only because they are still actually putting up the effort."
2,Good book for Spring!,"This is a really cute book. A little girl finds a seed, plants it, and then cares for the sunflower that grows. At the end of the summer, she gets the seeds from the sunflower and later shares them with her class so that they can grow more sunflowers the next year. It's a simple story but one that is perfect for this time of year and would be a great starter if you are going to garden with your child."
1,Nothing new from Mr Jackson,"Well after Drive, I really thought Alan was going try things on this album. Instead it seems he has put on effort what soever with this attempt. The critics normally love his music, in his own words, hes just a simple singer of simple songs.Well Im sorry Alan that just doesnt cut it. If French Fries were fat free is embrassing, if a Garth Brooks or a George Strait did a song like that, well all the critics will be up in arms.Its okay to sing old style country Strait, Jones do it perfectly, but just to do an album for the sake of doing an album is pure wrong.A very poor effort from an artist that should know better."
1,Anti Climatic,"Was expecting a unique unit which would allow me to uniquely integrate my IPod and PC. What I got instead was a nice looking monitor with ok graphics, tinney sounding speakers and menu buttons which discourage you from making any adjustments to the settings due to their feel and non ease-of-use. The number of USB ports and card readers on the base are the shining points of this monitor. I paid the bucks but didn't get any bang!!!"
1,The book to skip,"After reading the Hiram Key, I was all to excited to run on down to a local store and buy this book. It is informative to a point, but the author has gone so deep into his own exhaustive personal experience that I found it almost unreadable.Great author but this book is one to skip unless you prefer absolute tedium."
2,Large,"What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
2,Nice lil humidifier,I enjoyed using this little humidifier for a while. It did a good job.Be warned that humidifiers will make dust allergies worse though. My doctor instructed me to stop using my humidifier for that reason.
2,Great digital recorder,"This is an easy to use, lightweight digital recorder that you can fit into your shirt pocket. The screen is fairly large and easy to see and it works like any other digital recorder so it's easy to use. The USB connection that slides out of the recorder is a plus and makes it easy to transfer the recordings onto your computer. Great buy!"
2,Left waiting in the end...,"This book deserves five stars for a story well written, however I was left hanging in the end, what happened to Libby's father, who was the one who poisoned the water? The story deserved a ""finish"" like any story it had a beginning and a middle, the end is missing."
1,Good food basics,"If you haven't yet learned that sodas and sugar are bad for you, and more veggies are good, then hey, this is the book for you. While Rubin makes some excellent points, such as WHOLE honey having minerals and enzymes that can be lost in the heating process to refine it, he fails to point out the dangers of honey to pregnant women and small children. This may not sound like much, but then consider how many other things he may be failing to tell you about, or over emphasizing.Overall, the book is fine, with a few interesting recipes and discussion on how your lymph system works and how to best manage your intestinal health. However, I could have happily done WITHOUT him constantly pushing his company, his products, and the products of his friends (from whom I'm sure he gets a nice little kick-back). Take it all with a grain of salt, and it's fine, but frankly there are better books to read, such as Nourishing Traditions, Wild Fermentation, and Raw Food; Real World."
2,Finally and Unfortunatly Final,"This was well worth the wait. I've always been a big fan of live recordings and have been waiting patiently for Megadeth to release a live CD.I've seen Megadeth live and they have done an excellant job of capturing the sound as it would be at a show. Then there are the tracks chosen, couldn't be better, the best of the best.With Megadeth's recently announced disbandment, this CD was a must, and I must add an excellant way to go out. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed."
2,Long overdue exercise review,"I enjoy this tape very much. It has been some time since I have exercised and I have some arthritis and health issues, so I thought this workout tape would be a good place to start.I have been doing the "" 1 mile walk 5 days a week for about 2 weeks now, and enjoy it very much. I feel like I have more energy and hope to in the near future been able to do the "" 2 mile walk.Thank you Leslie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Excellent craftsmanship!!,These earrings are a piece of artwork. The craftsmanship is great. The only issue I have with these earrings is the size / weight. They are quite heavy and you have to put the backs on very tightly if you want them to hang nicely. They come nicely packaged and NOVICA does an excellent job of communicating the status of the order.
2,Long fan downrod fits perfectly.,"We have a sloped (cathedral) ceiling which is 13 feet high at he high end of the ceiling. we needed the rod so the 54"" fan blades would clear the slope of the ceiling and bring the fan to an appropriate height above the floor.There was no difficulty installing it."
2,Fits my Dell Studio XPS fine,The fan in my Dell Studio XPS desktop started to sound like a vacuum cleaner. This was a direct pop in replacement. Very easy. It has a hi-med-lo switch to allow you to adjust the fan speed. I have mine on Lo and it seems to be working just fine. One star deduction for the lack of any indication which way the air flows. I had to experiment to figure out if it was blowing in or out.
1,it kinda sucked a lot,"""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" is the song to blame for the death of punk music. Dexter Holland's voice is incredibly annoying. I kinda liked ""She's Got Issues"" and ""The Kids Aren't Alright"", but the rest of the CD is very bad. I used to like the Offspring, but now they completely sold out with ""Pretty Fly"". If you want REAL punk music, check out Bad Religion or Refused."
1,Again a bad start,"to a series that has everything wrong with it.Guess expectation is the sister of disappointment. Bad performance, bad sound, bad direstion, bad everything."
1,Color Me Unimpressed,"It's a technical triumph but a storytelling disaster. I care more about story than special effects, so count me out."
1,Faulty listing,"This book has nothing to do with ornithology, and should not be listed with other bird books."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I loved ""Altered Carbon"" (I constantly suggest it to friends) and thought ""Broken Angels"" was OK (not as good as the first but a decent sophomore effort, stupid twist at the end aside), but this was just a big disappointment. Heavy-handed social commentary masquerading as 3rd-rate science fiction - I should, perhaps, know better than to buy fiction that has a 'suggested reading' post-script, much less one that features Chomsky and Michael Moore. The cutesy bit where the protagonist ends up reading Morgan's first book really pushed me over the edge.Avoid this if you liked ""Altered Carbon"" and pray Morgan can re-find his groove."
1,wrong book,The book details and the look inside relate to another book entirely-one about quilts for babies.
1,Not so good,"Puff Daddy left Harlem at age 12, but for some reason he seems to think he is a hardcore gangbanger. Despite being a millionaire through brilliantly over sampling other artists' work, he still manages to convey a thug impression to the greater percentage of his fans. Fortunately for those of us who truly understand hip hop and rap music in general, he shares his fans with the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, and other preteen appealing groups that otherwise have no influence on hip hop culture, as well as a few misguided others who attempt to have 'east side' pride by supporting someone so an object of scorn by those from the 'west side'. But wherever you fall, Puff Daddy's annoying, high-pitched and repetetive whining in no way exemplifies rap or even hip hop, and he can't even write his own lyrics; that's why he replaced B.I.G. with Mase as his writer and rips off Faith Evans AND Sting in one song. (that's his only talent)"
2,bought 2nd one for my gf,"I bought first one 2 years ago for my XPS 13"" laptop...still works great till this dayjust purchased second one for gf...so I definitely recommend this product...fan bit noisy on the high setting but I usually run it on low anyways"
2,Great season!,This season had some of the best remembered and fun episodes! The music box drama featuring Laura being forced to turn on her stuttering friend (that Nellie Oleson was such a fun brat!) to Pa mining the liquid dynamite to lil Carrie falling down a well (if only they had left her!). Probably the most famous id the episode dealing with Solomon (Todd Bridges) and his struggle for racial equality. Very much a tear jerker and always good for a self-indulgent catharsis of tears.
2,Quite an Original!,"This was a no nonsense, get the job done sort of story. It was practical, yet still unbelievably moving. A tear jerker for certain. Highly recommend!"
2,Kindle 1 Works Great - Nook/Kindles on AT&T Problems,I just subscribed to the NY Times Blog and by the time I went into the kitchen and opened by Kindle 1 the NY Times Lastest News was downloading. For the Kindle 2 users connecting via AT&T in weak or no direct AT&T connection: I had a Barnes & Noble Nook for a couple of weeks and finally returned it. I live in a rural area where AT&T does not provide service but relies on partner connection which eliminates use of 3G connection. I could not get the Nook to connect to my encypted router even with Barnes & Noble Techs having me try multiple solutions that did not work and only made me go over $$$ my cellphone minutes. If your not getting automatic updates check your reception at the time.
2,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT GIVE US ""THE SONS""","This is a very good show done in Germany, and ""In the Heat of the Night"" is great, but I wish Bill would have included more ""Sons of Champlin"" material. It was refreshing to finally hear one at the very end of the show, ""Everywhere"", but it would have been amazing to hear ""Freedom"", ""Things are Getting Better"", and one or two of the other superb songs off ""Loosen Up Naturally"".In the meantime, there's that amazing DVD with Bill and the rest of Chicago, teaming up with Earth, Wind and Fire- that may sound strange, but trust me, it's superb!But I could have sworn I once saw a clip of the Sons playing live somewhere, and if the overall sound is anything like their live CD (from the '90s?) then ""that"" would be the ultimate Bill Chaplin DVD!"
2,"Thoughtful, beautiful film",I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater and can't wait to see it again on video. Fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and beautiful cinematography. It's a gem.
2,The best of the C&C series so far,"I really enjoyed C&C, but Red Alert is all in all the best and most engaging of the 3 (including Tiberian Sun) so far. A great game in the Real Time Strategy genre."
1,you will learn,"you all should have known but will soon learn that Nelly is Garbage and always will be. If you didn't know he whas garbage before he released these albums then you should have checked the CD out on ""The Leak"" on MTV.com and you would have realized it real fast. I'm sorry if you already wasted your money on this garbage but if you haven't hopefully I will save you $20. You all are welcome"
2,Innovative!,"It's my first remote extender. And I love it!This innovative extender is a great idea!The easy of use is very impressive, nice, precise and comfortable: you don't needto point to any target to control your devices.It supplies all my needs of a remote in controlling my blu-ray located inside a cabinet.I can command it from all the rooms in my house.So, I recommended it!"
1,Old Repeater Only 3 song Total Ripoff!!!,"My friend James recommened that I get the soundtrack that there were at least 9 great songs. Well maybe there were in the movie, but they certainly were not on this CD. I wasted my money.Only 3 songs Rocky theme, Eye Tiger, and Livin in America. Total ripoff!!"
2,"Good dictionary, once you learn the quirks","The dictionary itself is quite good, offering multiple uses of words in context. It's also easy to use. The caveats: read the instructions when installing! I didn't, and had to reinstall. Second, it can interact and interfere with the cut-and-paste function (actually, anything using the Microsoft clipboard.) Once you learn those quirks and how to handle them, the dictionary is an asset."
1,I don't like it,Don't allow air to flow through the shirt. Sticks to your skin. Stitching from the reflective strips cause skin to itch
2,THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scences are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the inoccent hobitt on a journey. Orlando Bloome shined agian in his role of Legolas. Viggo Morteson was just bloody brillant for Aragon. As a fan of the book series, Peter Jackson was able to sew together a series that will last well over a thousend years. The special effects were exellent but in some parts a little over done. Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving also made this movie a great film. Overall this film has it all. Romance, a journey that seems to never end, the test of a friendship and much much more! You have to see this film more then once!"
2,Works well with hand held heart doppler for home!,This gel works well with the doppler fetal heart monitors for at home use. This gel does not leave a mess and wipes away when you are finished. There is plenty in this bottle to use through multiple pregnancies.
1,fast lanes bowling,"Game is not what I expected. I am still disappointed with it, but I am getting to use the product to a degree. There is no help files of any kind, so any questions I have with the options menu and others go unanswered."
1,Worst cookbook I've owned,"I own many cookbook and actually can cook fairly well. I've tried 10 recipes so far and each one is crap. I think something went wrong when translating the Italian on measurements, cook times, and cook heats. This may be the best Italian cook book out there, but only in Italian. Avoid the frustration and lost $s, and get something else."
2,good rechargeables,It is good to see my son enjoying to play with the cars that still have power after two weeks.
1,Step away from this book,"If you like gratuitous vulgarity and an unengaging attempt to insert an intellectual backdrop over a lame story, you'll love this book."
2,Best Palm Keyboard you can get!,"I know that you might think, ""hmm, the best part of Palm is the graffiti and we should stick with that"". I can write 29 words per minutes but there were times when you want to do faster, e.g. during a meeting and you need to take minutes and so on. That is when the Palm keyboard comes in handy. This keyboard was nicely designed (yup, you can flip it to the size of a Palm), using really ""high-tech feel"" material and it's full size key is great! There is one thing I really want it in my wish list. Currently the keyboard is similar to a notebook keyboard which doesn't have the ""feel"" of the keyboard of the desktop PC, I really want to see this to be improved as I don't like the feel of notebook keyboard. Am I expecting too much?"
2,a must read,"if you've ever been serious about bringing out the genius within, you must get this book! The approach is not only innovative but effective. The image streaming and borrowed genius techniques are excellent and deceptively simple. It doesn't take long before you begin to realize the effects of this book. I'm a student in university now and this book has had a tremendous effect on my learning...especially my perceptive abilities. I recommend this book to everyone, at any age."
1,Dangerously Dissapointed,"From bootylicious to canned spinach. Girl this Cd is Dangerously in need to become a mirror or something useful. I don't mean to hate, but if you listen to this cd you will understand. I was a big Beyonce fan. I really think this album was rushed and had to many guest artist. I seriously think if she were to tape sounds of herself going to the bathroom and try to sell that she would get the same results. The only good song is ""Crazy in Love"" backed by JayZ. Sorry Beyonce better run back to Destinys Child. You nor Kelly Rowland are going to make it far by yourselvs."
1,So so so misleading,"Im really not into giving movies bad reviews, for everybody has their own vantage point. Although i will say dead clowns is very misleading. Dont get me wrong, i love indy films. I had been trying to get my hands on a copy of dead clowns because the cover is emaculate. Anything that looks that good on the cover, has to be good right? WRONG. WTF i dont understand i dont think i even saw a fkn clown untill halfway through the movie. No dialouge, very little plot, which my thirteen year old sister could have imagined. I actually bought this copy from amazon. I should have listened to the other reveiewers, when i read this was unbearable. Being stubborned like i am, i just had to find out for myself. I wont tell anyone else not to see this movie, because like i said before everybody has a diffrent vantage point. Ill just tell you to proceed with caution."
2,Useful training tool,"Heavier and more rigid than the tanto version but has the benefit of an integral hand guard. The paint cracks and peels quickly so it gets ugly fast. Other then that it's well made and lasts under heavy use. I've had a half dozen of these for training classes and they've held up perfectly for almost five years now. They bend but don't break, hit hard enough to tell you've been struck, but don't leave any lasting injury though they do have a tendency to leave welts with heavy impact where the lighter tanto-style knives do not. I strongly suggest avoiding head shots or wear appropriate protection. Great value-priced training tool."
1,Zzzzzzzz,The action was GOOD when there was action. This movies was SLOW. Kinda like playing the game RISK. A whole alot TALKING smh I was disappointed :(
2,Mobilizing Gun Sniper,"The Gun Sniper.I really like this model. I have bought two of them. It should take you about a half hour to fully assembel it (this includes the decals).The reason I got two is because I want to have one fthat looks like Leena Tauros's and one that looks like Naiomi Flugel's. I have already painted my Naiomi Gun Sniper Red , it loks pretty cool actully, just remember to take it apart before you paint it..As for Leena's I still need the following parts..1 Wild Weasel Unit2 Dark Horn Gattling Guns2 Dark horn Launcher units4 Dibison missle podsshesh I need to save my money..I recommend this Zoid to anny one who likes zoids or Mecha.I am going to get another one for my Bday, just because I like it so much.. maybe I will paint it black (good song) and put the Shadow fox's gattiling gun on its back. If It is ever released that is.. ..."
1,Absolutely the Worst!,"I was, and I emphasize the word was, a big fan of Patricia Cornwell until this book came along. I bought the audio version of this book on Ebay and am at least grateful that the full price wasn't paid. This book is absolutely the worst book I have ever read (listened to). I kept holding out hope that somehow this book would get better (or perhaps less stupid), but it never happened. I felt like a prisoner in my own car as I listened to this horrible, horrible, horrible book. I couldn't wait to get rid of this book."
2,My Favorite Singer,"I started listening to John Gary in the mid 60's. My favorite album was ""A Little Bit of Heaven"". I would love to get a copy of this. My record was broken. If you can reproduce this album I would love it. If anyone has it please notify me how I could get it. tommolloy@hotmail.com"
1,So boring I skipped almost 3/4 of it,"In a weird coincidence, both this book (on CD) and The Nanny Diaries (in print) arrived for me on hold at our local library the same day. It was like having two copies of the same book, both of which were boring and annoying. After reading (or listening to) about the first quarter of each book, I skipped to the last chapter or two, just to make sure that I wouldn't miss any strange and sudden surprises. I didn't. While listening to this book, I was put off by several elements: the reference to ""Jappy"" college colleagues, the narrator's inability to tell her two Indian roommates apart after living with them for a year, her repeated use of the ear-grating phrase ""as best as."" What is supposed to be so compelling about characters who have the boss from hell and are too stupid to quit? I'm glad that I didn't waste time reading both of these books in full, and that writing this review constitutes the last chunk of my time they will take up."
1,I tried so hard to read this that my teeth hurt!,"This is only the second book in my life that I could not get through. The language is difficult, the characters totally unsympathetic, the plot tedious to non-existent. After struggling mightily for several weeks (I usually read 2/week) I just had to give up. OUch."
2,"Great, especially if you're a New Yorker","If you've ever walked through the Upper East Side and spotted a five year old dressed in his private school uniform carrying a lacrosse stick, you'll understand that people like the X'es really do exist. The people decked out in designer bests at Tiffany's and Bergdorf's and Barney's with their minority caretakers in tow walk the streets of Manhattan every day.This book was very funny. I started reading it last night and finished it tonight."
2,THE TRUTH!,"Here's what's up with dis'.If you have ever been caught up in one of those ""twighlight 'kind of dreams,but you were really awake,then you probably might have listening to this,or one of the other gems that WORDSOUND has realeased in the last10?years.All I can say is that this is a soundtrack to your inna-illbient-self.I collect this stuff,believe me when I say that SLOTEK 7 is a classic.With Numerology being the underlying theme here,always interesting,never boring.I set out to find music that has a formula,and found this bubbling up from the crypts! starz"
2,Very good quality cable,"Received the cable very quickly. Connected to my audio system and noticed the higher fidelity sound at a great price. However, opened up one of the connectors and the wiring was exposed. Better wiring insulation and some shielding should make this a better cable. You won't go wrong purchasing these cables for the low price. Good job Acoustic Research!"
2,Absolutely hilarious!,"This is a great story with a strong, smart heroine. The one-liners are subtle but laugh-out-loud funny. Tiffany Trott is a most entertaining read....this is my favorite of the British-chick genre. I also recommend the Shopaholic books by Sophie Kinsella."
2,great show,"love the show, although this is season and the last one were the ones where they ""jumped the shark."" still had to watch it though!!"
1,SUTURE SELF,Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
2,MP3 listening...,"I have used a few of the Trellian products, and this one is pretty good. The drag and drop feature and their customer friendly format made it easy to use. The price is right too. Trellian has a pretty good website boasting a few other services as well, so their not just another software company."
2,Wonderful!,"This product works amazing! I ended up buying another one for my mom. The ocean and the rain are my favorites. I hate the night sounds (I live in Alaska, hearing crickets is just a strange and annoying NOISE) The rain had a clicking noise every now and again but after using it for a bit when we tried the rain again the noise was gone so it must have been from sitting. My mom's used it so much already I don't know how it's worn out. There are no problems other customers had. Though I imagine with enough constant use I will have problems with it (as expected from everything from cell phones to bedding, nothing lasts forever) Don't let the complainers scare you away because that's all their reviews are- complaints because things don't last forever. :) I think everyone should buy one or two!"
2,holman commentaries,They are beyond the help I need but when I get the entire set my grandson will be able to research any of the bible he wishes. It is a timeless series and will benefit my family for years to come.
1,Thank goodness for the extended warranty!,"I purchased this at Target in July, 2007. Because we have had trouble with various electronic gadgets, we decided to buy the extended warranty (3 years for $19). Good thing we did. This unit was purchased for our longer road trips. It really didn't have that many hours on it. Unfortunately, it failed on our recent 800 mile road trip. This was only 5 months after purchase. The kids were upset, as that was their main form of entertainment for the long ride. Since they were unhappy, we were all miserable (you know how that goes!). I have contacted the Service Plan people and they will be sending me a credit for the amount paid once they receive the broken unit from me. It is unlikely I will purchase this Disney unit again. However, based on our track record, it seems like unless you're willing to pay good money for top brand electronics, none of them last very long."
1,Nice Neutral Color,"That's all it has on the plus side.This thing is useless: the slightest breeze blows it away from the windshield and, if there is no breeze, the frost forms underneath it. You might as well just throw a blanket over your windshield."
2,LOUD - best for outdoor use,"If you need a clave that will cut through anything, anywhere, this is it! These are LOUD, LOUD, LOUD - to the point where they hurt your ears indoors. The sound quality still manages to be musical, though - pretty amazing. These are ideal for outdoor use."
2,Works well,I installed this in an auxilliary diesel fuel tank on my truck. It was easy to adjust to the specific tank size & gives accurate fuel level signals on a Sunpro gauge that I purchsed at the same time. The only negative is a lack of signal damping resulting in the gauge needle swinging about when driving on rough roads.
1,Good for beginners,"This a a great book for beginners - Absolute Beginners who know nothing about saving, investing or finance. I found the book very shallow; they touch on everything but just skim the surface and say very little of substance. I'm by no means an expert, but this book bored me and was a waste of my time (but not money - I checked it out of the library)"
1,Frustrating,Wonderful classic songs sung by an historic group but recorded in very low fi. The sound quality reminds me of recordings made in the twenties or music played through the speakers on my netbook.
2,Breaks new ground,"Can't understand the controversy, but male readers seem to be the ones most likely to not ""get it"", if that tells you anything. Roc's marketing strategy is also bad, the cover artwork and Carey's endorsement works against this book.This is not light entertainment, but a more literary and cerebral read of thoughtful social commentary. Cross deftly weaves in subtle, understated commentary on not just sex oppression, but that of class and race, as well as the power dynamics of religious and political oppression on us all.As a new writer, it predictably, but occasionally falls down in a few patches, where Cross doesn't quite 'pull it off', but this is a minor criticism of an overall highly talented work by a new writer.My only concern is that this potential talent, will be pressured to deteriorate into sensationalist trashy 'Sex & Violence' in order to sell. Nonetheless I am curious enough to get the second installment. I hope I'm not disappointed, after such a promising start."
2,Another quality FAX USA release,"As far as Im concerned, you cant go wrong with these double disc FAX USA releases. Another solid delivery of mind and mood altering music. Get it if you can."
2,Works as advertised--wished I'd waited for pricedrop!,"Works as advertised. Used our ""learning remote"" to program on/off and channel settings. Allows top notch video viewing from DVD/PS2/Wii.Owned 2 months now, no issues.."
1,An interesting but shallow read,"It is the year 2030 in this novel, and oil has become much scarcer and more expensive. John Grant may have come up with a solution to the energy crises, and he is a part of a complicated plot that skips around a lot and is hard to follow at times. There is war in the Middle East (what's new!), and this war does spread, a picture of a not rosy future.I found that Bart Kosko did not do very well in character development and also did poorly in describing places and scenery. It seems this novel should have been longer to flesh it out.In this book you will read about mind transfers to computer chips, artificial wombs, nanotechnology, and other technology about thirty years down the road, and all of this was done in a satisfactory way, but there is a lot more better science fiction out there to read, unless of course the subject matter of this book should interest you."
2,"stab, hack, slash, kill.","Cry_Wolf is a great, lesser-known slasher movie that harkens back to the '80's, red-herring laden, ""who is the killer?"", slasher movies. teens running from a masked killer with a knife: what's not to love?"
2,Its an ending,"The movie ends the full metal alchemist, the first anime adaptation, all right in my opinion, The picture quality is great as is the audio dubbing if you are interested. I didnt much care for the first adaption since it was so different from the manga but im just glad things ended unlike so many other anime adaptations where the series just ends without any conclusion whatsoever. If youre looking for some closure go ahead and get this movie."
2,Best Ever Console Racing Game,"If you want to drive a real car. If you want that awesome feeling of screaming past some other driver on the inside line. GT2, and GT1 are as close as you will ever get. DO NOT believe in other driving games until you experience this simulator for yourself. Complex and detailed and real make GT2 ( the follow up to Gran Turismo ) the best driving game to date.And coming from a guy that is 34 and who grew up around arcade driving games such as Pole Position, and super sprint, and Grand National 500....they do not even compare. Get yourself a license and feel the real need for speed."
1,Product wouldn't work.,Product wasn't new as advertised. It didn't work and was missing parts. My money still hasn't been returned .Beware this seller.
1,Superficial and repetitive,"A complex topic (fatness and size acceptance) is presented with a one-sided perspective, and worse, the book is boring. While some of these ""facts"" might be new to a few readers, mostly this is a rehashing of old data combined with her qualitative research and personal experiences. Every chapter ends with tips, and they all sound very similar. The chapter on the spiral of acceptance sounds very similar to the Stages of Change presented in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, but her suggestions for how to go through the processes are, again, very simplistic.The idea that some weight loss for health can be appropriate is an anathema in this book.Maybe an o.k. introduction, but if you are the least bit familiar with size acceptance, read elsewhere. (The best part of the book is it's cover.)"
2,Attention Cat Lovers!!,"This movie is for the cat lover in us all! Real cats, in an excitingadventure story. Charming and funny, exciting and heart-warming.Anyone who has ever loved a cat beyond reason, will want to see this film!"
1,Superficial and dishonest analysis,"As a Catholic theologian and ordained clergyman, I am embarrassed by this sort of superficial analysis. This is not a sincere attempt at establishing a serious dialogue, but a cheap caricature. Moreover, the author's own views are presented as though they reflect Catholic tradition. Instead, they reflect Catholic modernism, thinly veiled. I accept historical criticism and the legitimate gains made by modern scholars, but the view of Scripture in this book is much closer to liberal protestantism than to the Church's official teaching. Fundamentalism serves as a convenient surrogate for attacking the Church's own high view of inspiration and inerrancy. What a shame. And a sham."
2,Mind blowing story,"Read this story to get into the skin of somebody who woke up one day all transformed. A modern Metamorphosis but in real life. It's a sobering tale which can inspire you if it does not depress you. Read it if you are already strong in yourself and you don't need a pep talk which it's not. I initially purchased it to get motivated and it brought me down. However, it deals with reality and ultimately reality is what will bring anybody up. As we accept life as it comes to us, we are able to cope with it and make sure our positives are more than the negatives in life. To that extent the book does exactly that. My hat off to such a brave soul who chose to struggle to the very end. Writing a book with your left eye lid is proof that the human spirit lives on."
1,Utter Crap,"I can't think of a single cd that is worse than this piece of crap. ""I Hate Everything About You""? ""Just Like You""? All the songs sound the same and are the same, lyrically. They are just saying ""Life sucks and I hate everything."" What is the point. Such depressing subject matter would be alright if the music that went along with the lyrics would be good. This is not the case. All the guitar parts sound the same, the drumming is uninspired and the bass is laughable. I wouldn't touch this cd with a ten foot crap pole, and I would hope that if this review would stop 1 person from buying this, then I can die happy."
1,it works,"I had broken my previous cord and replaced it. My Ps2 is as it was when I bought it,now I'm gaming again."
1,Bad to the bone,"One major character is blinded, but continues to shoot up the place. I would have better spent my time by closing my eyes and resting up. Watch anything but this waste of time and talent."
1,this incribed piece of leather is a writing excercise.,"The so called 4QTherapeia has nothing to do with medicine. ""This is simply a writing excercise by a fairly skilled person, perhaps a scribe, who used a small left-over piece of leather in order to write some meaningless words and letters and thus to accustom his hand to the pen and ink and to the writing material before beginning to write in earnest. This is a common practice, both in antiquity and among modern graphic artists."" For details see J. Naveh, ""A Medical Document or a Writing Excercise? The So-called 4QTherapeia,"" Israel Exploration Journal 36 (1986), pp.52-55."
2,LOVE IT,"I love that the shipping of this product was within the time limit, and it arrived fresh and it smelled to good. i use it on hair, mix it with shea butter for the body and hair actually. TIP: if you melt shea butter and add coconut oil to it and put it freezer overnight(so it won't be grainy) it will stay softer, i think because the coconut oil is not as solid as the shea. Also i use some coconut oil in my rice, sooo good."
1,A major disappointment from a fantastic group.,"This CD is profoundly disappointing. Gone are the wonderful, wacky, chill-out tunes like ""Donkeys in Heaven,"" or that song where the cat meows through it. Fully half the tracks here sound like Oasis outtakes, with a lead singer who'd be booed off a karaoke stage. Banal lyrics are repeated over and over again until you run screaming for the ""off"" button. Maybe three tracks are reminiscent of the Bent we know and love, but they're not worth wandering through the dross.I don't know what happened -- if, like with Wham!, the talented part of the group left -- but this is a major disappointment from a wonderful group."
2,Awesome indulgences.,"This series has all the awesome indulgences you could ever wish for. Blood, sex, fighting, sex, blood, sex, arenas, sex, more blood, more sex, realistic fighting, realistic sex ... and an enticing and exciting storyline to go with it. What more can one ask for? This blows character-driven movies - you know, the ones with stupid people doing stupid things so the storyline writers have something to write about - out of the water. This is EXCITING and it moves as if it has a life of its own."
2,Oleeee Sevillanaaaa!!,"If you like Flamenco music then you will love Siempre Asi, it is actually a branch of Flamenco called ""Sevillanas"" for the noobies out there it is more orchestrated, with more rythm and with a rich full happy sound. The music is wonderful, beautiful classical guitar arrangements with percussion, drums and brass tones coloring the palette! + the voices of the eleven members of siempre asi you really need to listen to this album.If you like to get deeper also get more albums from siempre asi like ""Mahareta"", ""Cantando que es Gerundio"" , ""Todo Vale"" etc."
2,best game in history,"i would give this millions of stars. This is a great game. The voiceovers are awesome, the graphics are incredible, the control is good, and the fun factor is awesome. there are hundreds of disney characters. The worlds are wonderland,olypus colisium,deep jungle, agrabah, monstro, atlantica, halloween town, neverland, and hundred acre wood. I beat this game and i wish i can do it again without knowing the real story. I deafeated the great warrior Sephiroth, the ice titan and other hidden bosses. I did all of the extra things like finding all dalmations, winning hades cup, and sealing every world. I also got the ultima weapon. To all you final fantasy fans you might like this without the disney characters, I thought this game was dumb but when I played it I lived it, anyone who hates this game does not know what a masterpiece is. I proudly have this game on my rack of games. Everyone get this game and make it become a greatist hit."
1,"AWKWARD STYLE, NO EDITING","This book needs an editor. The stream-of-consciousness thoughts are not blended well with the dialog or action.Even worse are the sentence fragments. This book is written. In a very awkward. Writing style. A lot of. Incomplete sentences. And word phrases.Not much of a story, either."
1,was sent wrong item,The filters I ordered were for a Ryobi cordless hand held vac. What arrived were filters for a Vista cordless hand held vac
2,Sushi your way,Gave the book as a gift to a sushi enthusiast and they gave it high praise. They are excited about trying some of the examples.
2,"Lights Up New Brain Circuits, Opens New Possibilities","""Better Than Perfect"" is better than best. It is stimulating, evocative, and engaging. This ingeniously simple book triggers different insights and outlooks toward our careers, our businesses, and our lives.This book shows you why and how to be one of the indispensible, irreplaceable few who make a business extraordinary. How to think, learn, and communicate differently. With real-world examples, blended into a business fable.I underlined, highlighted, and made notes in the margins of better than 43 pages of this elegantly-written book.I got dozens of jewels out of Dale Dauten's book. But it got even more out of me.""Better than Perfect"" may just be one book you can't stop thinking about.Michael Cloudauthor,""Secrets of Libertarian Persuasion"""
2,Please Forgive My Ignorance,"I love the film. I love the music in it. So, could anyone let me konw title&author of ALL the songs that sound in the movie ?Another thing: is there any customer from SPAIN i can contact ?"
1,First-gen TabletPC to avoid.,"It's not the worst tablet to own, but it doesn't hit any of the sweet spots for a tablet other than WiFi abilities.1) It's not convertible, so you have to buy a USB keyboard for data entry.2) It's not using WindowsXP for Tablets, so you don't get the integration of Microsoft's specific handwriting recognition abilities.3) The hardware is pitiful, clearly offering power-saving compromises to overcome some engineering problems. The CPU is slow, the RAM is limited, and your hard drive isn't exactly fast or large.The best of the first-gen tablets was the Fujitsu Stylistic, but it cost twice as much. Of course, it also had twice as much ability. For tablet shoppers, the second-gen offers WindowsXP for Tablets, Office 2003 with OneNote (really leverages the tablet's strong points), better CPU selections and more mature engineering (convertibles!). Toshiba's Portege 3500 is probably the best tablet in the second generation, and that's the one you buy.Fred"
2,One of the Greatest Films Ever,"talk about a film that brings it from start to finish? also the supporting Cast was on point.the pacing of the film,style&feel ruled the way that films in the years to come where made to appear.this film is timeless&just gets fresher with every new viewing."
1,Very Boring,Dan Baker's book is boring in everyway. All the arguements he uses to refute Christianity have been articulated better by better atheists and agnostics. Baker essentially misunderstands Christianity and is therefore a poor critic. What Baker needs is a library card so he can read what some truly thoughtful atheists have had to criticize in Christianity. This book will be a waste of time for deep-thinking atheists and a hindrance to amatures. His style is droning. He over-simplifies everything showing no apptitude for understanding the complexity of the issue. The general mood is of a teenage boy who revels in talking bad about his dad. Atheism used to have more dignity. Humanism used to show more restraint and compassion.
1,the features sound great don't they?,"for about a year and a half, and all of the sudden, it just stopped working...and caused all kinds of problems...I did everything I could to get it up and running, and nothing...The hardware simply broke. That's the only explanation for this.If you want something you can enjoy and not have constant problems with...and if you want something that will at least last 2 years, find something else...and make sure it isn't a Pinnacle product...save yourself while you still can. ""Tech Support"" is non-existent. I have called and NOT ONCE have I actually spoken to a real person...not to mention, it's not Toll Free, and hold times are AT LEAST an hour. Find something else, i'm sure there are better products on the market...i'm looking as I write this."
1,It's enough to make a grown horror movie fan cry,"I thought adding color to this classic of the horror genre was the worst that could ever happen to it, I was wrong. The new footage stands out from the rest of the film (in a bad way), almost all the original zombie footage is gone and the new zombies should shut-up because they're far too noisey,the new folley effects are as subtle as a train wreck, and the new soundtrack is nothing to write home about either. As they say in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" enter (or should I say view) this new cut of the film at your own risk!"
2,Soap Opera with lovely accoutrements,"Yes, it is a soap opera with lovely costumes & locale. Very good acting & correct historical perspective. The story line of the upper crusts & the servants is a wonderful political statement. Enjoy!"
1,Contains natural rubber,"It is a well constructed, quality product. Unfortunately, it is made with natural latex rubber, which can be a serious problem for those of us with latex allergies. If you have ever experienced hand itching and / or pain after wearing rubber gloves, or have food allergies, or any other sensitivities, DO NOT USE this, or a similar, product. The more you do, the worse the problem will get, until it eventually becomes life threatening."
2,Fascinating Book,"I enjoyed this book. Normally, I avoid topics such as math, biology, and ecology in my pleasure reading, and I don't think I would have picked this one up if it weren't on my book club's list. But I was drawn into this book immediately. The writing is great -- smart, surprising, funny at times-- and I was completely absorbed by the complex, interesting characters, the settings, and of course, the fascinating story. Do read Brazaville Beach. You'll learn something and be entertained at the same time."
2,Good Fun Game.,"This game is great it's sort of challenging at the start whenyou have to collect pieces of the solar surfer but I found out asecret:AT THE START SCREEN,SELECT CONTINUE AND WHEN IT ASKS FORA PASSWORD,TYPE APRON TO SKIP TO CRESENTIA SPACEPORT."
1,Broke,"Ok, I have to flip flop from my previous review. It was working good, but just the other day after cleaning the plates and being sure to follow instructions of how to insert them correctly, the device doesn't work anymore. No lights no nothing. I've tried a few different things to get it to work, but without success. Its dead. The reliability of this product is now questionable in my view."
2,Viva La Difference!,"If you want some good, unique ideas for your wedding consider this book. It is fun to read and filled with many ideas I didn't find anywhere else, such as the elegant vine and light covered gazebo that graced our ceremony. I especially liked that it got me thinking creatively for myself. While a couple of ideas seemed silly to me, who knows?--they might be perfect for you. This books shouts ""Viva la difference"" and isn't shy about it. I liked it so much that I'm giving one to my friend for her upcoming wedding."
1,wendyr,"We purchased this because I wanted a whistling tea kettle. I am very disappointed because after only several months of occasional use, the whistle component has broken off and fallen out of the kettle. It can not be repaired.The look is sleek and the kettle opens automatically when you start to pour but this does not justify the cost, esp, when it does not last!! Find another kettle that costs less!"
2,Great for Baseball Fans of All Ages!,"Decide who your favorite teams are, what they're worth, and set up your Monopoly game! We had a NASCAR version of this game, but within a year or two, the drivers' names were outdated and my kids didn't want to play it anymore.With this game, you can change the board face AND the deed cards to reflect the ever-changing world of sports!"
2,A Mesmerising Tale,"This book is a wonderful tale of the actual mysterious carpenter of the Sisters of Loretto and his masterful staircase. I thought it was wonderful how the staricase was a way to test the users faith in the end, with no railings on either side and built of strong and sturfy mysterious wood and wooden pegs instead of nails. The fact that the actual staricase has withstood all these years is amazing as well. I give this novl 5 stars because it covers everything that is needed and only leaves you hanging in one aspect, whisch is exactly as it should have been. Perfect."
2,Baptism At Bull Run,"This story is a riveting tale that takes you inside the first battle of the Civil War after Fort Sumter. Reger puts you inside the minds and hearts of the politicians, generals, and common soldiers on both sides of conflict. His description of battlefield surgery is as vivid as any portrayed by the movies. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the real story behind the Battle of Bull Run."
1,"Lots of plastic, not much color","Disappointed that it's so much smaller than it looked and the center plastic part seems to be about 95% of the toy. Grandson likes it, but can't use it without getting the opposite color on his hand. Clever idea, but not well executed."
1,Needs better instruction. Or include other items.,"Some people on here said it can only be used on glass. Mine apparently was the opposite. Destroyed the glass on my over $200 cage, burnt my snake, and then melted itself. Came on here to find the issue was probably the cord being ""pinched"", and that some heaters come with a lifter to prevent this. Obviously this one doesn't. The goddamn thing has ""under the tank"" in its name in the company doesn't think to include an item that will keep the pad from melting your pet to death. Add a housing around the cord for Christ sakes, or reinforce it. What a terribly disgusting flaw.I will not buy anything from this company ever again, and will highly recommend against anyone else doing it."
1,don't buy it,"Besides being light on details, the copy I got had several key pages missing - there but just blank. Shows a lack of attention to detail. If you are just getting started in the tanning/leather/rawhide business it is an OK read about history and techniques but there are better books on the market. Get this one from the library."
2,Daughter loves it,"Our daughter loves playing with this and the other foxes and wolves that she received as a gift, made by Schleich."
2,"A great, albeit quick, read!","I'm so tired of music biographies where the subject is either villainized or practically canonized; none of us are perfect saints, nor are we completely evil. That's why I always find it refreshing when a writer presents the true person, most of whom are a little of both. Piazza has done that here.Martin is something of a tragic figure; a mad genius. In candid interviews, Piazza has found all the good in the man, as well as peeled back some of the bad. He shows that if Martin had been born in another era, or been a king of another genre, he would have been a hero, but in the holier-than-thou bluegrass scene, the hard-living Martin was considered something of a black sheep, despite his obvious brilliance.This is a great book, and definitely one of the best music biographies ever written."
2,Absolutely enjoyed this story,"Literary masterpiece? Naww.... Well, worth the time to read? You betcha! The characters were just real enough to make the story something to buy into. The author was able to weave an odd tapestry of plot, silly, robots, and an inept human and somehow end up with something that was fun to read. That is the best reason to read this book, it is just plain fun. I want more, so am off to get more of this author's works."
2,Thought Provoking,This is an excellent book. I could not put it down even for a moment. It really makes you think. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
2,Nice little package,"Great little drive, superb for mailing files in a flat rate pack. Good performance"
1,Westbend broke after 7 months of very light use.,"I am upset. The circular cutting wheel and washers fell off the main shaft, making this now useless! We barely used it, perhaps opening about 3-4 cans a week over 7 months. And I bought this only because I read so many great reviews--that said, did we get the one lemon in the batch? At $25, I expect more than 7 months of use--and I see the price is now up to $33. If anyone has a suggestion as to whether parts are available, kindly respond. This is very disappointing."
2,Excellent resource for teaching and research,"Great stuff. McIver neatly reviews anti-evolution (in the broadest sense) before and after Darwin. Thought provoking in that is shows the mental tricks critics will turn to avoid contradicting the Genesis account and agreeing with Darwin.It's a shame the revised edition wasn't updated. Still, highly useful.As an aside, it's highly unlikely that the comment above attributed to McIver is true. McIver comes across as one who _always_ belived in evolution (see, for example, his articles in ""Creation/Evolution"" and ""Skeptic"") ... methinks I smell a hoax."
2,My mother loved it,My mother likes big number pads and she uses the memory features when they are easy to understand. The phone has 2 prominent memory buttons in addition to the others and I put in my cell number and my sister's and she loves it. People over 65 will use technology if it is well designed. She's very happy with it.
2,Taking control of our own lives,"At first, I just went to the place at amazon where it says: ""Already Own It? Rate It"" and I clicked on ""five stars."" Then I was referred to other books I might like based on my rating. They referred me to books about writing for children! NO. This book is not about the ABC's. It is about scapegoating. Glasser is a psychologist who works a lot on helping people (children and adults) learn to take responsibility for personal behavior. Children and adults need to break free of the ""blame game."" This is an insightful little book. I highly recommend it."
1,Gun With The Wind,"These guns do not work on flat screen, LCD, or plasma televisions. So, unless your TV is an older model, don't waste your money. I wish someone had mentioned that fact before I let my kid spend his allowance on it.No more Duck Hunt."
1,BEWARE - INACCURATE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"This battery is NOT the correct part for a T23. I can't attest to the other models. The battery may well replace the part numbers listed, but they are NOT the ones for a T23. I bought this item for my son, who lives in another city, knowing that he needed a battery for a T23. The battery delivered does not look like this one, and as I found out when I got the part number from my son, the ones listed here are not for a T23."
2,Swing This Town,"This is the best record of The Brian Setzer Orchestra! Jump Blues and Swing of course. Great! Cover ""Jump, Jive, An' Wail"" of Louis Prima is great, ""You're the Boss"" of Elvis/Ann Margret (Viva Las Vegas movie) is better than original (Gwen Stefani sings great), ""As Long as I'm Singing"" is an old Bobby Darin song, ""This Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""The Dirty Boogie"", ""Let's Live It Up"" and ""Hollywood Nocturne"" and ""Switchblade 327"" are his originals, while ""Sleepwalk"" (orig. Santo & Johnny), ""Rock This Town"" (orig. Stray Cats), ""Since I Don't Have You"" (orig. The Skyliners), ""Nosey Joe"" (orig. Bull Moose Jackson) are very good covers too.Some excellent musicians are featured here (Tony Garnier - stand-up bass, Mark Winchester (ex. Planet Rockers) - stand-up bass and Eddie Nichols (Royal Crown Revue)-backing vocals). Brian Setzer is winning again!"
2,A Meistersinger to end all other Meistersingers!,"Karajan's live '51 recording under the direction of Walter Legge is truly a testament to Art herself.Perfection and Excellence are the mottos of this historic performance.The intensity Karajan brings to the score is overwhelming..just listen to the overture for instance!The sound is in wonderful mono...better than Naxos's recent re-issue or that of Uarania. Unfortunately this set is discontinued from EMI, and only comes with the German libretto. Nevertheless, what is most interesting in hearing this set is the ""dramatic through line"" which is rarely captured on record, but is self-evident and vivid thanks to Karajan.A fantastic display piece is you ever find it used. You will fall in love with Meistersinger all over again listening to this recording."
2,Perfect for Booklets,I like this product because it works great for stapling booklets. The adjustable guide makes sure that each staple is at the same distance from the edge. I would recommend this product to others.
1,"Ok, but SBM-200 is better","This massager is alright, I bought it prior to buying a Homedics SBM-200. I find that the stationary massage points leave much to be desired. For double the money you get a much better massage with the SBM-200 since it moves up and down your back."
1,Stole sweetness,"Gently grating vocals paired with muted melodies and tourist techno, exploiting a sort of generic emo-prog, keep tame connections at bay."
1,Fun... but not fabulous,"This is really a bathroom book or something cute for the coffee table. There is nothing really great about the book (except the title), but it was kind of fun to flip through it. I read through it in less than an hour and tossed it (I have no room for it in my bathroom or on my coffee table). The book might be cute as a gift, however it's not something that I would put on my bookshelf and keep. I read all of the other reviews before buying it and I guess my expectations were just too high."
1,Review,I was very disappointed that this was not Mark Lindsay singing on this CD. Nothing was aid that it was not the original songs.
2,Good up until the ending,"Our family liked the action in the movie, except for at the ending of the movie. We liked the special effects. -The End"
2,Totally has improved my yoga experience,"this mat is awesome. I just roll it over my yoga mat and my yoga experience is 1000% better. The towel absorbs all my sweat, and the little grippy bumps on the other side keep the towel from moving anywhere. Plus, it folds up really small. It's great quality and has made yoga so much less frustrating for me! I will never ever take a yoga class without it again."
2,Intergalactic Dentistry brought right to your bookshelf...,"A simple dentist is just doing his job when he ends up operating on an alien. He impresses the aliens so much that he is kidnapped to train dentists on the aliens' home world. This book is excellent, and indeed an interesting journey for imaginative minds. One of Anthony's best single books in print."
2,Durable and Fun!,"Lots of fun and SUPER durable! Our friendly big blue puppy is about to celebrate his 6th birthday and he doesnt look a day older than 1! My older children loved this dog, my youngest is under the recommended age for this toy but is already enjoying it very much with some assistance. Besides the durability my most favorite thing about this toy is the fact that it doesnt require batteries as there are no electronic parts to it! Ive heard many delightful and imaginative sounds being made while my kids are/were enjoying this fellow."
1,Christian fundamentalism!,"This is NOT a book that someone should care to read, that is, unless you are a cynical fundamentalist Christian who believes that whatever is not ""good Christian values"" is the sign of the Devil. There are plenty of better books out there that deals with religious perspectives on UFOs in general and extraterrestrials in particular.Dailey believes that ALL occult and New Age movements have one thing in common; destroy Christianity. No wonder people turn their backs on a religion that refuses to accept other values. It is not an investigative book, but rather a Christian manifesto filled with Bible citations and cynical ideas.People shouldn't talk about Satanism unless they know what they're talking about, and Dailey clearly does not. Don't bother buying it."
1,Would Have Rated it Zero Stars if I Could,"One of the stupidest and nonsensical ""documentaries"" that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The DVD espouses typical anti-Catholic rants and fantasies that characterize fanatical fundamentalist hallucinations and unrealities.This is 66 minutes of my life wasted watching this nonsense..."
1,not what i expected,the flim sarted off good and then kind of was a let down.i really wasnt clear why the girls killed themsevles. after a while the plot just seemed to drag.the good things about the movie were the perfomances i esipically like joshharnett as the small but important role of trip fontaine. overall i felt the movie could be a lot better.
2,Extraordinary!,"I'll join the chorus of praise for this unique and lovely film. I will echo an earlier comment by a reviewer who stated he or she had been looking for this film for a long time. Indeed confirms what I have believed about love for so long. Watching this film was an emotional catharsis for me. Not in a long long time have I been so emotionally involved in a film from beginning to end. The acting, directing, SCENERY!-everything works like a charm. If you're a romantic like me this is the film for you. You'll be watching it over and over again for years to come. A classic of immense proportions."
2,Bing and Satchmo are always great,"This CD of Bing and Satch is great. Bing Crosby's radio shows, as most of that era of radio, had lots of adlibbing from the script. They were so comfortable together, as they were good friends in the business. Bing's voice is like comfort food such as chocolate (if you love it) or a good hamburger, or jello with whipped cream, etc. Louis Armstrong was a great musician, so with the combo of great musician and great singer, one can't go wrong. With Bing and Louis on this CD you can't go wrong. Diane Barrie"
1,Couldn't believe how bad!,"I bought this radio to replace a non-digital SRF-88 which gave me many years of wonderful listening. That radio used a single ""AA"" Batter. This radio has great features, but someone at SONY forgot that people like to listen to radios. Compared reception with other portable radios I have. Used it indoors & outdoors. Exchanged radio for another. Reception in a big city with many clear stations unbelievably poor, constant static. FM reception expecially bad. I'll accept my loss and look for a new replacement."
1,"The Director, Writer and everyone involved in this movie is a Disgrace to the TV Series.","I hated it once I saw the cast and then once everyone started actually speaking I felt even more disgusted. I can not possibly believe that anyone who ever saw the TV series would produce a movie to monstrosity. The cast is nothing like the movie, the script is atrocious. This movie resembles the TV series in name only."
1,Disappointment guaranteed for old and new M:tA Players,"I have been a long-time player of Mage: The Ascension, and this version was a major let-down. First of all, there are new rules concerning Avatar Winds, a bogus idea that makes crossing the gauntlet harder for magi. Second, the traditions are now almost the same, only varying in their beliefs and specialty spheres. In the old version, Cultists of Ecstasy got all level 1 spheres as always active, but no more. They also cut out a lot of information concerning talismans, sanctums, familiars, and such. I will admit that the rules have been clarified, and that they made Paradox a greater threat, but they did not bring back the rotes list like I wished they would, and only barely even mention that rotes exist. In all, I'd say to go for the second-edition if you can get your hands on it. It is a much better version."
2,Kids love it!,"Now there are a bunch of touch/feel books out there, so they may be more appealing. I DO know that, when our kids were little (long ago), this was one of the few out there and it was universally loved by them and many of their friends. That said, I opt to send what I KNOW to be a home run to kids now."
1,Not in French!!!,"The comic book was in ok condition, but I wanted the French language version but got the English version instead!!Could not even return it as I took all the books as gifts to India...very disappointing!"
2,Captured my attention . . .,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Once I got past the misleading synopsis on back of the novel and accepted the novel for what it really was, I became intensely involved. Roger Williams and Vivian Twostar are stereotypes, which is the point. They are cariactures; Dorris and Erdrich having a little fun with the stereotypes people have placed on them. The depth of character found in Erdrich's other novels is clearing missing; however, _The Crown of Columbus_ is a different kind of novel. It is a modern romance, detective, adventure, and historical novel at the same time. I recommend this book to someone looking for an entertaining read; anyone seeking high literature should read Erdrich's _Tracks_"
2,25 years experience with Mobil 1,"I won't use anything else in my cars. When I buy a car, I keep them and take very good care of them. My most experience with Mobil 1 was on my 1995 Eagle Talon TSi turbo which I bought new. I sold the car last year and the motor was still like new with 180,000 miles on it. Even the turbo was still like new. I used Mobil 1 from about 8k miles on. I sold it in August of 2008 to a young motor-head an he's since put another 20k on the motor. 200k on a turbo 4g63? that's some good oil. And when you checked inside the valve cover, like new. The cams had no wear. Seals on the motor never leaked. I currently run mobil 1 in all our cars which includes an '08 Toyota Avalon, '03 Maxima 6 speed, and an '02 accord. The accord has 140k on it, still running like new. I break in the new cars with dino then switch 'em to Mobil 1. I also extend the drain intervals to 7-10k."
1,stay away,"i have purchased 4 or 5 recordings all blu ray from this manufacturer (they go by two names that i am aware of ) all had terrable audio, most did not play at all, most were returned .. this is the only review i have ever written guess i should write a review of the many very fine recordings i have purchased probably more than 75 are blu ray format"
2,Good Stuff...,"This is the good stuff. Even my grandma would be shakin' to this first wave skankin' reggae. For the Brits out there, it's worth the price for ""Soul Limbo"" alone, which you will fondly recognise as the raw and vibed-up original of the BBC's cricket music. Absolutely inspirational! If you've come so far as to read this, don't hesitate to buy. This music willl make you happy."
2,Styling and clean sound at a low price,This is a perfect unit for a small room. Don't expect too much out of it.
1,Twister had great sound and effects-period.,Twister gets a star for the best sound in a movie I have ever heard. Twister gets a star for some good special effects. Twister gets absolutely no stars for its actors/actresses (especially Helen Hunt) and its plot. That's all I have to say.
1,Nuvi GPS Carrying Case,"This carrying case is just fine for the GPS but only protects it and not the other things you have to support the GPS. Would have been nice to get a GPS bag that carries the cords, etc. As I said before, this works okay."
2,Mechanix Wear are the best automotive gloves!,These types of gloves are the only ones I use when working on vehicles.
2,Can't Wait,"I am looking forward to getting this dvd. The special features may not be good, but at least we are getting the season (better than the volumes)!"
2,Easy to use alarm clock,I got this alarm clock to replace one that was too bright at night. This is great. No frills and is a bit hard to see in very bright light during the day. But easy to see at night and you can dim it so that it doesn't interfere with sleep. Very happy with the purchase.
2,an entertaining book with serious underpinnings,"With ""Streets on Fire"" John Shannon delivers another winning book, as entertaining a read as anything he's done, despite his audacity in throwing some relevant political content into the mix. I have to agree with Charlotte Vale Allen's bewilderment at the vitriol in the PW review--does a genre book have to be witlessly apolitical to be worth a reader's time and effort?"
1,The code already used,The code was already used when I tried using it. I wasted over $18 on nothing. Very upset. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO LOOSE MONEY
2,"Swift,Speedy and Unbeatable!!","According to the comic,the Stealth Hunter is the air arm and the top esponiage unit for Exo-Force.It`s rival is the Fire Vulture,which is more armored.Now, here`s the cool part.It`s about the pilot, Hikaru, like other pilots, his head has dual faces to change expressions.The Stealth Hunter is always backed up by Takeshi`s Grand Titan,or else it`ll just end up half destroyed,forcing Ryo and his Uplink to repair it.I love it, but I still don`t have it.The Stealth Hunter is the best !!!!!!!!"
1,IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU NEVER SEE THIS!!!!!,"I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen!!"
2,"relax, it's vic","'merriment' and 'mighty monkey' are instantly classic vic songs. those who already like vic will enjoy this album, it's one of the better ones, very subdued vic, very piano, very mellow, sometimes very sad. some great vic melodies herein, even some beatles sounding background harmonies. great stuff, the one disappointment being that it's ten songs and only thirty minutes long. other than that, it's near perfect vic. another golden chesnutt if i may say."
2,book,"great book! My mom bought it for me when I found out I had cancer. It was very healing and also empowering. I have gotten this book for several people since, even doctors. Anyone can get something worthwhile out of it."
2,An awe-inspiring disc!,"This CD was absolutely incredible! Corigliano's music bristles with energy and at the same time can still to a very beautiful calm. The piano concerto is exactly like this. It is one of the most phisically and emotionally exciting pieces of music that I have ever heard. The work is mostly atonal, but there are some very nice tonal sections in the piece. The third movement is proof of that. I do not usually go for atonal pieces, but the piano concerto is one of the best that I have ever heard. The last minute-and-a-half of the final movement is absolutely astounding; it's jaw-dropping! The other pieces on this CD were excellent too. I especially liked Tournaments. And Corigliano's orchestrations are some of the best I've ever heard! So, if your looking for some great, approachable modern music, I can't recommend this disc enough!"
1,It is not for Olympus C3030,"I do not understand why this bag is on the C3030's list of accessories. It's to small for C3030. I bought it, hardly could squash the camera, than forgot to send it back. Just a warning for others ....."
1,disappointment,"After much consideration, I chose this over the Nespresso, because of the positive reviews. It is uglier in person than the picture depicts,(big, plastic), noisy, and takes too long to heat. The foam is not nice either. Back to the nespresso -- quiet, good foam, looks nicer on a counter, takes up less room, and you have the option to just heat the milk without the foam, if desired."
2,Memories of Chewie,"This kind of makes up for the terrible way Chewie dies in Vector Prime, but not quite. the only thing I personally HATE about this comic book is the way the author makes Princess Leia sound like a selfish brat."
1,d,"I have had this scooper for about three years now. It was great for about the first 8-12 months, then the coating in the scoop starting to pit. I still use it, since I have not bought anything else. I like how it scoops and the ice cream does not stick too bad to it, but I don't like the pitting of the scoop.I gave it a two, since the finish in the scoop is junk and is coming off. If it was not pitting, I would have given it a 5 star."
2,Kevin Smith's brilliant stab at a romance movie,"Chasing Amy is a 90s love romance in the eyes of Kevin Smith. Only he could com up w/a plot so hilarious and clever. The story is about this guy Holden (Ben Affleck), and his friend Banky who create comic books together. Holden falls in love w/ a girl, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), but there's one problem... she's a lesbian. So throughout the entire movie, Holden tries to win her over, despite the jealously/resentment of his best friend, her wild sex life of her past, and any other unpredictable things that come his way. The cameo by Jay & Silent Bob, a regular in all of Kevin Smith's movies, gave the film a humorous break from the romantic drama in the movie. It's a must see movie."
2,Exploring Chemical Analysis,"The textbook was exactly what I wanted, the edition I wanted, and I received it promptly. I have nothing to complain about."
2,A Great buy!,"I love my Zen. I've had it over a month now. The software is included, but you can use windows explorer to load it.Music, Videos, storage, Date Book, calander, Alarm Clock, Voice Recorder, and an FM Radio!It does way more than they advertise.It works with Windows, Yahoo Music, Audible Books and more.Right now I'm downloading videos from YouTube!I have never had to use the reset button.Right now there are hundreds of songs stored on mine, I lost count at 250!All high quality audio.Now the bad news. It is a little slow to start up.Go ahead and buy the (expensive) charger from the manufacturer.I have found nothing else that works.The screen it VERY bright in the dark, but still hard to see in sunlight.Most files will have to be converted. I've found free software for that.( www.Downloads.com ) YouTube Grabber, YouTube FLV to AVI Suite.This has been a good product for me. A Great buy![...]"
2,"Even if you watch it once,watch it!!!","First of all, I highly recommend this movie.Not because of the Academy Award,but because this is a good movie! Ethan,with work like this you WILL win a best actor Oscar one year.Denzel,You acted a fool man! With a supporting cast like Tom Berenger,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Scott Glenn & Macy Gray you couldn't go wrong.In a nutshell it's about a wet behind the ears rookie (Hawke) promoted to Narc, and ""trained"" for 24 hours by Washington. But there's a twist:Washington is a crooked cop.I'll leave it at that."
1,I recommend a much better book than this one.,"I read this book and I think that it is trash. The rules go against nature. I do however, highly recommend the book titled How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You, written by Leil Lowndes.The book How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You is much more realistic (I also give this book 5 stars)."
1,Dorman replacement mirrow Chevy truck 2006,"I did not like mirror after replacing ,it shook bad while driving down interstate and moving slowly on my street would not recommend."
2,"Not bad, not bad at all.","Exactly what I ordered. Plain and simple, in perfect condition. Definitely a great deal, I think it's safe to say I got more than my money's worth."
2,Great as usual,Five for fighting has done it again. This CD is awesome. The single 100 years is true fff music. I only wonder how he keeps coming up with such meaningful songs. They seem to touch me on a level that much music today cannot reach.
1,A disappointment!,"I ordered this video for my daughter, age 2, after she showed an interest in the alphabet and numbers. The fact that this was a Parent's Choice led me to believe that it would be the perfect educational video. Was I wrong! The 2 songs that deal with the ABC's go by so fast that my daughter couldn't keep up. Don't even expect that this video will help you child learn numbers. The first counting song only repeated ""1-2-3"" over and over and the second just showed a little girl randomly counting to 5, 6, 7, and 8. The songs didn't even keep my daughters interest. All the video contains are songs that are boring to a 2 year old and seem like they would be trivial to a 5 year old."
1,I lost another 85 minutes of my life,"What's the point of this film? A girl trying to find out the meaning of love and pretending it's a documentary. So what. I think Charlyne Yi is the only thing decent about Paper Heart. She is funny in an adorable kind of way, but even her ""performance"" wears thin over 85 minutes. The movie description didn't really interest me, so I knew I was taking a chance going in. I was hoping for a nice surprise and I ended up just waiting for it to be over. It's not all bad, but the good moments are few and very far between. Oh, Michael Cera in real life acts the same as M.C. in every movie he does. What a range."
2,Consistent quality,"I have used Hemke reeds for the last 20 years. I discarded one the other day after only beginning to play with it, but I do not remember the last time I had to to that. The reeds do not typically warp. They are cut to center every time. The strength is consistent among boxes, and the tone is always great. They are my reed of choice for my C*(s), yanganasawa jazz, vandoren jazz, and otto link mouthpieces. I use them on alto, soprano, and tenor. I would love it if they could maintain strength longer, and I usually have to dispose of them within a few weeks after I begin playing on them, but non-synthetic reeds can't last forever."
1,NASTY Smell!,"I was excited to find this product, and was hoping for something that smelled similar to NARS Body Glow. This was definitely NOT it! It smells more like old lady perfume that's been on an old lady who has been dead for a couple months. REALLY nasty. My two year old (and this is a boy who doesn't even mind the smell of his poopy diapers) got a whiff of it and said, ""EWW, yucky mommy!"" Now, that's pretty bad! With that being said, I do have to give it a little credit. I used it on my hair in the shower (hoping the smell wouldn't linger since I would be washing it out with shampoo), and it made my hair very soft. I can tell it would probably make my skin soft too, but the smell is just too disgusting to ever try that."
2,An overview--not for in-depth study,"This book is a general overview of the Forex market, including its history. All the information contained in the book is helpful, but it teaches neither the various economic factors that have fundamental effects on the currency markets, nor the technicals involving day-to-day trading. If I wanted to buy one book to get a general idea of what everyone is talking about, this would be it. It is also an easy read for a short afternoon."
2,"Not just for sports fans, but for LIFE fans","My brother told me about this book (since he's a life-long subscriber of SI), and I then got it for my boyfriend. I couldn't resist reading Barkley's introduction before gift-wrapping it, and then I ended up reading the whole thing.I'd only read a few of Reilly's columns before & had always enjoyed them. This book presents the best of the best in the perfect package. Some were laugh-out-loud funny with Reilly's sardonic wit, while others definitely put me in a pensive mood for the next few hours.The way Reilly writes his columns shows that these stories are about life and that sports are the secondary factor. This book makes the perfect non-maintstream book gift. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't relate to or get something out of Reilly's columns."
1,Horrible quality,We bought this book new from Amazon and it fell apart the moment we opened it. The binding is poor quality and soon the pages were everywhere...complete waste of money.
2,Not All Known To Me Prior To Purchase.,"Some of the 16 tracks are quite well known to me, including Jesus Is Just Alright by The Doobie Brothers and Laser Love by After The Fire.The former may not indicate the band's personal spiritual postion, however this song could easily be covered by a Christian artist with excellent results.Johnny Cash certainly did that with Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.There are two songs by Kerry Livgren of Kansas, Slow Motion Suicide and To Live For The King, both sung from the heart.Musically Roy Buchanan's The Messiah Will Come Again is very good, only I struggle to hear the lyrics, Alice Copper's Nothing's Free has a suitably menacing tone and The Call's The Walls Came Down is possibly the standout from this collection.Some of the remainder are middling, but overall this is well worth owning."
1,UFC Classics Vol. 1,A lot more talking and other filler thanactual fighting action. This would makea great thirty minute video if edited downto the actual action.
2,rudy ray moore is ahead of his time,this man is a genius.rappers are saying things he sayed almost 25 years ago now.rapping and doing karate all at once and the dub voices that is crazy genius.i enjoy his work alot.i've seen comedians who couldn't hold rudy's jock strap with there hands and somebody else's.the man has his own style and vision.
1,Impractical,"I did not like this book because all the answers to the problems are listed in plain sight immediately below the questions. Just in reading through them I catch sight of the answers and it is very impractical. I prefer the ""Dummies"" workbook."
2,Lots of power for its intended purpose & then some,"Looking for a way to cut higher branches too large for a rope-pull lopper, this is a great item. I'm encouraged at it's power and long battery life - both beyond what I was expecting. Do remember to oil the chain/cutter bar frequently, as others have mentioned. It'll be a happier helper. It cuts thicker (3 1/2"") boughs much more easily than I was expecting, with nary a protest. I'd get one again, for certain."
1,Moderately entertaining but bad ending,"Started off pretty good with a lot of suspense and kept me wanting to read it, but during the last quarter it just dies. The ending is one of the worst I've ever read, but the fact that during the last quarter of the book you can TELL it's going to be a bad ending just ruins it.Seems like the author just got tired of writing and cut it short by a hundred pages or so as there's never any military or saving of the world like the books description says.The first 3 quarters of the book were good, and it had an interesting concept but I have to give it a 2 because of the sudden ending that left me feeling disapointed."
1,Has Godzilla finally met his match?,"Summary: It's Godzilla meets Godzilla when the King of the Monsters does battle with a robot clone of himself.Despite the above average monster effects, script, acting and score, there's something about this movie that just keeps it from being a Godzilla classic. Two and a half stars would be a more appropriate rating. Certainly worth viewing.Next is ""Terror of Mechagodzilla""."
2,A Must Watch Series!,"When this series came on television, I ignorantly overlooked it. I was so in tune with the ending and beginning of shows on HBO, Showtime, etc. Television shows weren't doing it for me. They were cliche and boring. A friend asked me if I watched ""Breaking Bad"", and I said no. He insisted that I watch it. I was 2 seasons behind, so I went and bought the first 2 seasons. Wow! I couldn't believe what I was missing. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue..absolutely incredible.I can't wait for this to be released so I can watch Mr. White and his counterpart handle their business...."
2,I haven't read it....,"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering if this was the same Alissa in The Christy Miller Series?"
1,non functioning CD's,Buyers beware. I ordered 2 copies of Autobiography of a Yogi and the CD's did NOT work.AB
2,The West Wing - Complete Series Collection,I purchased this set for my husband for Christmas. I couldn't have found a more perfect gift if I had searched all year. He is a tremendous fan of the series and was truly thrilled to have ALL of it. We have been watching an episode here and there since Christmas and have enjoyed every minute - both of us.
1,Not so good..........,I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like. All I know Is I've stoped.The novel and Movie is really good!BATTLE ROYALE 2 was not that good.Later.........

1,Not worth the money.,"Cheap knockoffs of original style first sold on QVC. Plastic is thin and does not slide smoothly on carpet even with fairly light objects. Other brand ""as shown on TV"" also poor quality. Glue dries out and foam pad separates leaving them useless."

2,Wyoming,"I keep ordering more of these socks. Long wearing, comfortable even in summer, but I particularly like them for wearing when I do the barn chores in our cold weather. They seem to breath fairly well, so my feet are warm, but not sweaty!"
2,"""Mac Not Afraid To Venture""","Word Of Mouth is not your typical Mac McAnally recording but when you think about it what IS a typical Mac McAnally recording? It is almost impossible to categorize Mac's music and that is what makes him so interesting. His willingness to venture into new unexplored fields is so refreshing and welcome. I'm sure that the fans of Mac's earliest recordings will be quite surprised at ""Word Of Mouth"" but give it a chance before writing it off. Mac's songwriting skills are again the highlight of the project and his warm, friendly voice always brings a smile. Be sure to pick up a copy and remember that on July 27 Mac's first two albums will be released on CD for the first time. Well worth the 20 year wait!"
1,another bomb,"In the usual fashion of Stephen Coonts novels they take the best clip from the book to lure unsuspecting people to buy the book. Once you get the book though you trudge through page after page of slow and boring literature.. To put it into perspective, I am more likely to pick up my Economics text and read it for fun than i am to read Cuba. The book is horribly drawn out.. What could have been said in 100 pages has been drawn out to 390 pages. Guess I should have learned from the Under Seige. I recommend reading a book by a better author such as Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."
1,Not the very best.,"Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo SpeakersIt was easy to install, and the sound is good. I have a problem with a popping sound. Even when the stereo is off. One or both of the speakers will pop on and off, for no apparent reason."
2,The Time!,"The writer's are precise in their name reference to the western devil. Art imitating life. Great job writers, directors, producers and crew. Bravo!"
2,Incredible Story,"Got this book from someone in my family, she belongs to a book club. They met this author and said the author was really down to earth and the story was true, so I read it. I love this book. I did feel she could have had chapters, but my cousin said its because she wrote it in conversational format. ITS A GOOD READ. I would say this book should be given to every girl living in the hood. What this author does makes her a brave woman. I am very proud of her and to know she has made it through. not everyone can say that. FIVE STARS IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH."
2,A new looks at blues.,"With Shades of Blue, Al Petteway once again proves why he is one of the finest fingerstyle guitarists and composers. This is not a standard blues CD, although there is plenty of blues and ragtime on it, if that is what you are looking for. Instead, this is a series of compositions in, as the CD's title points out, shades of blue, variations on blues themes.Al's style is pleasing and clear. His compositions range from enjoyable to moving. He plays with as much heart as he does skill, and his skill is considerable. I have listened to this CD over and over since getting it, and I am still not tired of it.I particularly enjoy ""After Dark"", ""Smoky Mountain Morning"", ""Alphonso Brown is Back in Town"" (read the liner notes on this one), and the truly moving ""Requiem"".The only thing missing from this CD is Amy White, who makes this already great musician even better, more soulful. She is the other half of the orange. That said, this is a great CD and will not disappoint."
2,Invastion - the complete series,I watched this when it was on TV. Really enjoyed watching the DVDs over and over again
1,Just got mine an hour ago from Amazon,"Started off with a positive attitude until I got to the screwdrivers. After breaking my thumbnail in a couple places I finally gave up and got a small screwdriver in order to pry up any of the 3 blades. I've worked them back and forth and still the same. The smallest is the worst, no way to flip it up with a fingernail. The Phillips head on the other end is just fine. Guess I'll Email Leatherman tomorrow, if possible, and see what they say. I bought this under my wife's account, so if the review is under her name, let it be known we are talking a man's somewhat bigger, tougher thumbnail, not hers."
1,worked great until it broke,"Worked great until it broke. Had it for about 3 months, always handled it very carefully, but then it just stopped working right... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird, and ultimately unusable. :("
2,Powerful lyrics accompanied by a powerful voice,"For those who have been tracking DeGraw's path to fame since the beginning, <i>Chariot</i> lives up to expectations. DeGraw's ability to tap into the listener's deepest emotions with songs such as ""Just Friends,"" and ""[nice to meet you] Anyway,"" is a talent that most song-writers are lacking nowadays. In all, ""refreshing,"" would be one word to describe this man's first album."
1,very forgettable,nothing special here.it's like 4 different movies in one.a little bit of everything that's been done before.but overall nothing really works.it's more like a ALbum than a real movie.very Predictable.
2,A new brushing experience.,I've had this brush for a month now. The vibrating brushing experience is different but effective. i like the feeling like you're massaging you gums as you brush. A great value from amazon and I hope my next check up shows an inproved cleaning performance. I have sensative gums and this brush helps with a easy brushing tachnique. Holds a charge well and ergonomics are good. The only reason I don't give it five stars is due to expense of replacement brushes. About $10-$15 each.
2,Great fun!,These 2 old classics on 1 DVD of the 1930s with the heartthrob Tyrone Power are great fun to watch! A new generation must see them! Amazon'scompanies are wonderful to offer them at great prices. I'm startinga collection.
1,Andy Griffith Show Marathon,"Can anyone please list the shows that are included in this DVD? I would like to buy it, but after reading the reviews, I'm not so sure. I had to rate it something, otherwise, it would not post this question."
2,BONUS TRACK CUT SHORT BY 14 MINUTES,"Nothing more needs to be said about this great album. It is indeed a classic. The idea of adding the live track of Pick Up The Pieces from the Montreux Jazz Festival was a great one that made me purchase the CD - only to find out that the original 22 minute jam session had been cut to 7 or so minutes. WHY? The disk has over 20 minutes of blank space, so it wasn't because there was no room.It could have fit with room to spare. The full version is one of the greatest jam sessions you'll never hear unless you have the original 2 lp set from that time. It is not available on CD. The fact that some genius made this decision is mind boggling. Because of this I can only give it 4 stars. With the full version it would go beyond the 5 stars allowed to a 10."
1,IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...,"DON'T BE FOOLED. It's a $20 laser level, and it works like a $20 laser level. Don't waste your money, it's just not even remotley accurate"
1,2 for ease of use,"I bought this stroller for our three year old daughter yesterday and will be taking it back tomorrow morning. It took my husband and I to snap the pieces together and a lot or re-snapping to get them to stay in place. Once we got it together, our daughter could not switch it to any other position...nor could I. The pieces kept snapping out and the plastic pieces that hold the frame together are already showing signs of stress. While pushing the stroller through the house, the front tray simply fell off. We were quite upset with the wheels also. The wheels are simply hard plastic and do not turn well. I was disappointed that I had to take this toy away from our daughter, she was so excited to get it. Spend a bit more and buy the graco car seat stroller combo, much higher quality."
2,Great turtle!!!,"This is the cutest stuffed animal ever. Made very well and a good size, not too big or too small. My grandson loves it."
1,"Amazing guitar, but shoddy attempt at a story","It pains me to have to give any Buckethead album such a low score as this, but I feel that I simply have to. While this CD does contain some amazing guitar playing and a few very strong pieces, but I think that the attempt to make the whole follow a story-line was, put mildly, rather unsuccessful--a lot of the intermission pieces seem to have no point at all. That isn't to say that this album is all-bad--quite the contrary. The opening theme is amazing, the long track ""Computer Master"" shows Buckhead's versatility, and the ""Home Run Derby"" main theme is easily Buckethead's best.It has its great moments, but only moments."
1,It must be a bad joke!,"I went to quite o lot of trouble to get the cassettes and was deeply disappointed when I got them and found out that in two items set, one cassette is completely destroyed - the tape is broken in two pieces and creased. I just can't imagine how a seller can write that condition is good, when in fact it is unacceptable!!! What am I supposed to do with such a ""good cassettes""???? I tried to contact the seller via Amazon, but never got a reply. Thanks again!"
2,"Works Perfectly, Easy to Install","Within 15 minutes of receiving this card I had my local area network up and running between two computers. Admittedly, I was looking to do something very simple: two computers, side by side, connected with an RJ45 cable (not included with the card). The drivers included on the CD-ROM work fine with Windows 98. My only complaints are that the card sticks out of the PCMCIA slot about an inch and that if you remove the card and reinsert it the card needs to reinstall (a simple process). I bought this card as a cheap test to see if I could set up a simple network before trying to tackle a wireless network. I am so satisfied that I will probably buy D-Link wireless hardware."
2,Time Well Spent,I first saw the movie before reading the book and became an addict. I could not get enough. I then ordered each book after the first and read them all within a few days. ADDICT. I can't wait for the movie to come out and am even more excited about the sequel!! I would recommend these books and movie to anyone that wants to snuggle up and enjoy a few hours to themselves!
1,Venus-Peter O'Toole as a Dirty Old Man Out of Control,I think I can be brief with this review as I don't wish to spend too much time or emotion over it. The story is a pathetic romp through the mud and I can't believe that O'Toole would permit himself to portray a dirty old man in heat.Those of you who are long time fans of O'Toole would probably do well to avoid this film as I have been an admirer of his work for my entire life and felt badly for him after viewing it.Those Amazon reviewers awarding 3 stars or less to this movie agree with me and I don't give a dam what Hollywood said about this film.
1,OK,Pretty general. Not much detail instruction. Pretty pics that are not very infomative. Wish I had bought another! OH well.
2,any guess as to when...?,"oops, i'm not writing a review just wondered if you have any idea when this book would be available. i check back every so often to find same msg. also wanted to grab this opportunity to tell you how pleased i am to do business with amazon. you guys are running your site right. congratulations."
1,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"I really like cappuccino so I was a little disappointed in the flavor of these cappuccino pods. They are not bad but I feel they could be better. I got this brand because they were cheaper than other brands. I think I will try the more expensive ones just to compare. But in reality, I probably won't purchase these again."
1,Not a do it yourself guide,"This book is good for parents of kids who are new to or in speech therapy but, it's not a do it yourself guide. I was hoping to, teach my child how to say it right. This book gives some background and helps a tiny bit but, it didn't help in the least with teaching my daughter how to say her ""r"" sounds properly. On the speech therapy I go. Save the 10$ to apply to your deductible unless you just really want to learn more about speech problems."
2,"I trust it, enjoy it, and open it first.","I've had this book for quite a while, but had to write after being shocked by some quite negative reviews. Apparently there's one in every crowd. ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"" is a compendium of many cooking styles, and everything I've made from it has turned out brilliantly. Delicious, with attention to healthful, seasonal preparation and ingredients. Unless you don't live near a decent market, her ingredients are quite available or easily subsituted. It's laid out simply and intelligently and her comments in the sidebars give the recipes personality. These sometimes quirky comments, combined with my experience of success, give me the feeling that she (unlike some other well-known authors) has actually used/developed the recipes in the book. I turn to this book often for advice, inspiration and good food. Highly recommended, and I trust it."
2,A good find. A great buy,"I bought this watch about a year ago and I will admit it was because of Stranger Than Fiction. I was contemplating purchasing a more expensive swiss made watch but I feel this has been a great buy. Very accurate and solid feeling. For about 90 bucks, you can't beat it. My only gripe is the beep is very soft, so don't plan to use this as an alarm. Functional and stylish. You can display 2 time zones on the LCD. You also can turn the LCD display off to use less battery and appear a little more ""formal."""
2,Fantastic! Who'd a Thunk it?,"This review will be short as my hands have a hard enough time typing these days. I picked up this book a long while back with the idea of seeing what all the fuss was about. A story about a bunch of rabits? How can it be THAT good? After reading it, I absolutely loved it and subsequently went on to read ""More Tales from Watership Down"". I can't tell you how upset I am that the story ends there. But anyway, it's an incredible story that has me wondering if the author somehow had an ""in"" with this bunch of rabits and how could he possibly know all of this for it certainly seemed ""real"" and plausible in the telling. The fact that kids now read this in English Lit (it was new when I was in school) is great because that stuff can often be somewhat dull and hard to read. THIS however is NOT one of those. I will love this book forever and will probably be reading it again sometime soon."
1,Too scary and I'm not a scaredy cat!,"I can't use this thing. Its not easy to use, its loud, and its nearly impossible to see well enough into each follicle, much less hold it there still while you get zapped and it beeps at you. Maybe if someone else was doing it for you...."
1,"Instead Of Creating New Stuff, The Artist Rips Off Prince","Buy the original album ""1999"" for some real funk. This annoying collection of remixes just proves that he does his best work ALONE. No boring rappers, no annoying back-up vocalists, no redone riffs on a classic song. The good news is Larry Graham's basslines kick ass and Rosario is a wonderful poet. The bad news is: 12 bucks for a bunch of remixes? Sheesh....if you're gonna charge us the price of a full album then MAKE a full album."
1,"Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow!!!!!!","""Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow!!!! Get them off me . . ."" - Me after 10 seconds of trying these on. Went straight back to Amazon."
1,Adoption Nation,"Adoption Nation provides an interesting historical and sociological account of adoption. However, the author has a very clear bias and is not afraid to let it show throughout the book. He presents important facts, many of which I have not found in other books, however he does not fail to insert his own opinion about these facts in every place possible. If you agree with Mr. Pertman that absolutely open adoption is the only healthy alternative, international adoption is misguided, and that non-traditional families are morally incorrect when they wish to adopt healthy children (as Mr. Pertman and his wife did), then you will read this book without cringing. If, like me, you disagree with any of any of his very clear biases, then you will find his lack of journalistic objectivity disappointing."
2,perfect album,"talib kweli is my favorite MC..this album is perfect, but reflection eternal - train of thought had a few better cuts...overall this is classic material..cop it.1"
1,Find something else to read.,"For some reason this book tries very hard to get its audience to be sympathetic to a man who falls in love or so he thinks with a girl he doesn't know. Trying to be faithful to the ""Love of his life"" he sleeps with every one in his town from widows to 14 year old girls when he is past fifty. Not the type of person I am usually sympathetic for. The main character doesn't have any redeeming qualities except poetic writing but even that is over the top. How can you write thousands of pages of love to a girl you know nothing about except for her name? This book is so unrealistic, the characters are not interesting and the plot keeps getting sided track to events that have no real importance at all. The only likable character (and I say that lightly) dies from a pathetic tragedy that seems at first to be relevant to the plot even if it is unlikely but no that too was just more wasted words. If this is what I can expect from Oprah's list I will steer clear."
2,Must read - shame you can't!,What a shame that this wonderful book is now out of print. Frankly it ought to be compulsory reading for anyone who ever ventures near a statistical test. Anyone who understands the assumptions behind a t-test should be able to grasp (and enjoy?) the arguments.
1,He's gone overboard with descriptive horror.,"In his previous novels, it was just horrific enough to keep you turning the pages to see what could possibly happen next, but this book just goes over the edge. You don't have the chance to use your imagination because it's all written out for you. After waiting so long for this book, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed, and a bit sick to my stomach. Mr. Harris gives out ""too much"" information this time."
1,we die alone,"i have read the book but was not happy just because is almost the same as the book ( AS FAR AS MY FEET CAN CARRY ME).some pages were exactly the same , word by word.it look like it was a copy of the other book( as far as my feet can carry me)i was very sorry that i bought the book and lost interest very fast."
1,"Gun Valkyrie is ok, but it is nothing compared to Halo","I was a little put out on this game. I gave it a good hour, and I tried to get into it, but I could'nt. The fine people at Sega, I would say, missed a really good chance to make a really good game. Its basically a point and shoot game, but it does alot of the pointing for you. The controls are frustrating and the whole concept seems un-original. Like I said, its ok. But not a great game."
1,horrible...,"I bought these marker not just once but twice, the first time I purchase the 5 primary colors and found that the marker would not write on harden chocalate... I figured it was just a bad batch so I bought a halloween 2 marker set,, well the same thing didn't work!!! Do not purchase these marker what a waist of money!!!!!"
2,Great base line DVD player.,"I have been shopping for a player for several months. When I saw this one at [local store], I snagged it. Great price and all the features I wanted. However, I got it home, plugged it in and ""POP"", dead air. Returned it and got the second one home and plugged it into the TV and surround system. WOW!! Great picture and sound!!! Plays all the DVD menus and music cds. Really recommend this model for a basic DVD player."
2,mother gone mad,Good book and would recomend to anyone to buy. It does help shed light on her murder. To me it is a must.
2,Amazing,This movie offers an amazing and stunning view of a totalitarian society in the future. Wesley snipes does a great job at playing the villain. The story is told with a comedic twist that makes it so enjoyable to watch.
2,wow!,I thought my old vacuum did a great job--I just couldn't stand replacing the messy bag. I used this vacuum for my weekly cleaning. The canister needed emptying before I even reached the bedrooms. It was easy to put together and easy to empty. I am very pleased.
2,"A Modern Fable, of Humor and Wisdom","The Characters in the book are unforgettable. From Aira Flight, the super girl that is oh so human, to Mendle Orion, a guy who wants a woman for her soul, to Onx, the dragon dog, oh I really want a dragon dog now. The characters and plot kept me guessing until the end. The humor mixed with the quotable wisdom on almost every page supports the theme of the book. The book design is outstanding, for example each chapter is set up as minutes on a clock and the end of the book, is the count down. Exciting read, a real escape into another world yet holds to associated reality and wisdom for our own world. Sometimes the style is fairy tale like and the language is formal, but I think the author was going for that. Hence it's a modern fable.Found this book for as little at $12.00 and as much as $179.00 why? It would have been nice to get it for my Kindle."
2,Croscill Townhouse Wastebasket - Amazon.com,"[...]I have bought numerous items from Amazon and have never had a problem. Everything arrives super fast, including the free shipping items! Can't beat that!! This trash can arrived in 3 days.The Croscill Townhouse wastebasket is not plastic. It's a ceramic or porcelain. It is gorgeous..very rich and elegant looking. It's a nice sized bathroom garbage can. Nice enough to also use in your bedroom. Not small but not too big, just the perfect size.Croscill is discontinuing the ""Townhouse"" collection. So if you are interested in any of the bedding or bath items...buy them now! Prices are MORE than 1/2 off of original. The bedding pictures show a dull, drab comforter, curtains, etc. TRUST ME! It is not like that in person. The colors are rich and vibrant. The ""Townhouse"" collection is very elegant and classy looking. You won't be disappointed.[...]"
1,Good season but bad quality of the DVD,"I am a fan of Criminal Minds and I own all the seasons.However, I am surprise to find that the quality of this Season DVD is really bad...almost like a VHR or VCD quality... =("
1,Do you ever want to sleep again?,"I bought this after reading the label for ephedra and anything else I thought would be problematic. I had very few qualms--it's One A Day, after all! Talk about an established brand! After taking them for three days I had one whole night of sleeplessness! Although I've never been sensitive to caffeine before, I guess the amount of it in these vitamins is so high that I spent the most miserable night, just trying to get some sleep. I think consumers should be warned much more of that possible side effect. I threw mine away."
1,30 Harry Connick Jr.,I was amazed and very sorry that Mr. Connick did this album. I have all his cds and I was very disappointed in this piano playing cd. Please Mr. Connick go back to singing with your band.
1,Poor Software Quality,"Kaplan TOEFL CBT tests are really buggy and scores are not accurately calculated:1. The program does not recognize correct answers where more than one answer has to be chosen.2. The program does not retain the essay.2. When shifting from the general test feedback section to a specific section analysis (reading, listening or structure) and back again to the general feedback section, all the scores for the test change. You have to go back to the Main Menu to retrive the original scores for the test.3. When re-taking the same test for a second time, the whole program locked and I could not verify my answers."
2,Two sides to the synth!,"This marvelous album consists of short, melodic songs like Speed Of Life, Breaking Glass, What In The World, Sound & Vision and long, dark pieces like Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall and Subterraneans. My favorites include the catchy Sound & Vision with its poetic lyrics and brilliant guitar hook and of course the atmospheric Breaking Glass which inspired Nick Lowe's ""I Love The Sound Of Breaking Glass"" on his Pure Pop For Now People album. The short pop pieces are strangely addictive in their robotic minimalism, while the long instrumentals are quite evocative but they would probably appeal more to lovers of classical music than your average Bowie fan. (Those who like Gorecki's ""Three Sorrowful Songs"" would love them). On Low, Bowie took synth music in two very different directions. This was a groundbreaking album for its time and remains a remarkable listening experience although I definitely prefer the first part."
1,One long song that is repeatedly interupted by track changes.,"What on Earth is this supposed to be? Perhaps the title is more befitting of an adjective to describe this album than the band intended. Namely... nothing! The entire thing consists of a sonic bombardment of the most annoying distorted guitar tone one has ever heard. Rather a lot like putting your ear up to a really old, broken vaccuum cleaner and turning it off and on over and over again. Deafening nonsense. Those who find this review unhelpful: quick, get back to the mall before it closes!"
2,A Thinker,"Excellent, well casted movie. Probably best viewed with someone else so that you can discuss your findings. A movie that needs to be watched more than once inorder to formulate your final conclusion. A real thinker!"
2,An excellent state of the art on information retrieval,"A very good approach to IR from a computer science perspective. Well organized and easy to read although some chapter could be dry for a novice. Excellent cover of visualization techniques, digital libraries, and web searching from a conceptual point of view. The reference list is large enough (and up-to-date) to keep you busy reading more material for several weeks."
1,This product will melt,"This is a great product until it melts. My son saved his own money and purchased it. A few months later it melted. I have read several posts about this happening a lot. I would not purchase again, it is not safe."
2,Thought-provoking and Rich!,"Being that Rebecca Jones is my mother perhaps I am partially biased in my review. Truly though, all favoritism aside, I found this book to be the wisest and most knowledgeable book on womanhood from a Biblical perspective that I have ever read. Too many women's books are cut and dried, cliche and reductionistic but this book truly delves into the role of women in the Bible, their role in society, within the church and the home. It is thought-provoking and rich and redefines womanhood according to Biblical principles."
2,Good quick overview,"This is a good overview of vitamans, minerals and other supplements. A good starting place and quick vitamin reference. I read the paperback version years ago. This has some updates to that."
2,awesome product,This bag worked great for my kayaking trip to protect my camera...would buy it again
1,Second Read of Bronx Zoo,"I read this book years ago, after reading Jim Bouton's Ball Four, but did not have a good recollection of the book. Now I know why. Although there are some entertaining parts in general the book is only average as a written work and the content, as one reviewer noted, is first person whiny. Sparky Lyle should have stuck to pitching and focused more on being a competitor. The book is filled with contradictions as he relates hsi values as an athelete. Save your money."
2,Perfect Goggles,I've swam all my life and these are really high quality goggles. They fit great. They keep the water out. And they're really easy to see out of. Couldn't be happier.
2,oooooohhhhh yeah,"Nah, I think I would have to say that this book IS falling down funny, in fact I've never laughed so much. Burroughs, Thompson, I hear people compare Mark Leyner to so many beat or other post-modern writers, but I guarantee you that you will NEVER read something quite like this. I ended up reading at least half the book aloud to my roommate while tears were falling down my face from my fits of laughter. It may not be for everyone, but it is surely for anyone like myself that likes their humor fast, random, and fantastically absurd."
1,Godless?,"I don't think anyone is godless wether they go to church and pay the preacher man or don't believe in God they are subject to the same laws. Denying gravity exhists does not make one float in the air. Denying God exhists does not make God dissapear. Of course ""Religion and patriotism are the last refuges of the scoundrels"" and Ann Coulter is certainly one of those."
2,"Great toaster, the whole family loves it.",This is a great toaster. It has a push button to toast if it's room temp. or if it's frozen. It is simple to use. The kids cook small pizzas with the push of a button. It toasts the bread perfectly. It cooks leftovers great. You won't be dissapointed.
2,The best chimes I've owned,"I bought a set of these Wind Dancer chimes for my new home, and I can't believe how beautiful the sound is. Apparently there is a difference between ""tuned"" and ""not tuned"" chimes, because these chimes make subtle, clear sounds that are perfect for weekend naps. I've had other chimes that are too clanggy-sounding for that all-important task!"
1,He sang better the first time,"His voice is strained, the music sounds like a warped record and I will never play this cd again. Better to use the sounds of 40 years ago, than to sing them 40 years later."
2,Good Buy! Easy to Install,I received the product in a timely manner and it was easy to install and made of durable materials.
1,inadequate description,"I just received this product. It is sturdy and should suffice; attaching leg struts to basket was quick and simple, and the handlebar brackets are just fine. The problem is that nowhere in the description does it specify that it only works for a particular type of front wheel hub. There is no warning about not fitting a ""quick-release"" assembly, or requiring a different type of hardware for that. Either make it clear that the basket will not work for certain types of front wheel assemblies, OR be kind enough to supply the alternative hardware and alternative instructions. A couple brackets, a couple screws, and another 2 paragraphs of instructions could not cost more than fifty cents, and would go a long way toward making your product suitable for more people."
2,a very comprehensive overview,"I read this book to get an understanding of the history of korea in the greater sense, and also as one of a group of books on Korean history. It is very comprehensive, coverinig gthe range of Korean history from a brief synopsis of the prehistory of Korea, through the major part of ancient Korean history to the bulk of more modern history. I enjoyed this book finding it to be an interesting read, with a lot of details, would make a good history text for a class on korean history, which is exactly what I wanted from this book."
2,Works as Well as the Name Brands,The only real attraction of this item is its price. It is less explensive than the name brands but works just as well in my Seiko label printer. I am going to keep using them.
1,PLEASE do not buy! It might encourage them...,"Painful. That is the word to describe it. My toddler LOVES Thomas and I and my wife with him. But this movie is an abomination, regardless if you know the other Thomas films or not. Alec Baldwin is halfway cute, but Peter Fonda gives the worst acting of his career (and I like Peter Fonda). The story is painfully puzzled together. It seems like the producers took words like gold.dust.dog.railroad.friends.magic.grandpa.horse because they knew that those words were popular with viewers and mixed them randomly into a story and hoped for the best.They also deviated from the concept in the Thomas films that there is some not-so-nice-behaviour involved but nothing more drastic. Diesel is not ""Not-so-nice"", he is downright evil and destructive. This garbage is not for young kids.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!! IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEm TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!! WHO KNOWS WHAT GOOD ACTORS GET WASTED THE NEXT TIME AROUND!!!"
2,"Please, do something!!","This is one of the most exciting mini-series I have ever watched. This movie stays with you while other movies fade in your mind. I first read it as a book and later found it on VHS. It definitely needs to be made onto DVD, so, how long will it take? Who must be contacted to release it onto DVD?"
2,Handy addition to yard work,Has worked very well around the yard. It could be a little wider at the handle for my large frame.
2,Finally an antenna that works!,"I love this antenna! I saw the price and thought what could it hurt and the reviews on it looked great. I had recently purchased a Phillips Brand Antenna and it did not work well. I spent a pretty penny on that one and it got very little channels and I constantly had to move it.When the antenna came it was really small, smaller then I expected and it looked cheap to me. As soon as i attached it to the converter and scanned channels it picked up over 30 channels. The picture on each channel were clear almost like cable channels and I had to only move it once to get all the stations to stay clear. It fits perfectly behind my tv.Only downside is when the weather is bad or its windy it slightly falters but that is to be expected. To me its the little antenna who could, perfect."
1,WHAT'S UP PLAYBOY?,"The film takes place in MIA and uses a lot of street language as the make the ice so they can get the paper or cheese. The movie looks like an HBO street documentary with poor camera angles and talking to people like ""Whypp"" ""Pyg"" ""Dog"" or ""Mooch."" But clearly it is not a real street film as the camera shows you both ends of a telephone conversation. The plot involves some home boys dealing drugs in the street, telling the guys that work for them they owe them for all the drugs no matter what happens. It feigns some politically commentary when it mentions the disparity of jail time for crack vs. cocaine.There are drug deals gone bad, deals with Latinos and a ""cracker"" but no real plot, just a slice of life. No character build-up and minimal plot.Written, directed, produced, music score by and starring Tony Mashino.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity."
2,A MUST BUY,"It is a one of my favorite cd's at this time. So, manygreat song: ""That's why Godis singing the blues"",""Pictureof home"", ""Wring that neck""and meny more. The band sounds better than ever"
1,Don't bother,"It is amazing to me what a publisher will publish in this day and age. This book is worthless. There is no plot. The characters are not developed and nothing they do or say makes any sense. It appears to me, after wasting my time reading this book, that the author's sole purpose is to pass her own depression and melancholy on to others. You know, misery loves company. Well, you will be absolutely miserable if you try to read this book."
2,This movie is a must See !,"I though this viedo waz very well done... i got 2 c inside the label i really like ... The pieces of some of the viedos i didn't ever see before were a big plus... I really got to see inside some of my favorite singers ... Like 2pac ( 1 of the greatest rappers to ever sing .. if not the best), Suge Knight (AkA the CEO of Death Row Record) and Nate Dogg , To name a few ... i feel that anyone who likes rap or most of all the WEST COAST ! should see this movie... i though giving out Dre'z and Snoops home address was a little out of hand ... but i got to say it was a Great way to end the movie ! Well thats my Review .. Peace"
2,AMAZING!,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this mat! Nothing sticks to it! No more struggling with sticking fondant. I wish I had this mat a looong time ago! Made my cake jobs such a breeze. I am in LOVE with this mat!
2,Awesome,The dawn of electronic music. A must have for anyone. Wendy is phenominal. I have this on vinyl and the CD brings forth a much greater amount of subtleties.
1,Not Happy,"I bought these for my wife's car thinking I could improve over the original headlamps, well that didn't happen and within one week I'm replacing these with another set (Sylvania's). The first set came in and one of the bulbs didn't work, I called customer service and they sent a replacement, they both worked this time but the wife wasn't happy, she couldn't see any better and maybe worse cause of the way the light beam was!?! The packaging had no details like what you see on the web page, it was just a clear box with bulbs not even sealed. I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Half of AA slots don't work after a year,"After warranty expired, 6 of the 8 AA slots don't work while all the AAA still work. I've been charging only PowerEx IMedion 2100 mAh AA and 800 mAh AA batteries. The company offered to replace with a 25% discount, but that brings the replacement price down to $82.46.I expected more quality for this lightly used charger, so I couldn't recommend this model to others."
1,Meh....,"Typical Uncle Mikes product. Its cheap and it shows, but it does its job and when it falls apart you can just buy another one."
1,"Donny, what were you thinking?? Why do ""Muzak"" 70's songs?","Oh Donny...what were you thinking?? This album is absolutely horrendous! (Which is heartbreaking for me to say, as I'm such a huge fan of yours. I love everything you've ever done...except this.)Perhaps if you'd tried new, fresh arrangemets for these tired, tired 70's songs, it MIGHT have worked.But why pick songs that have been relegated to elevator/grocery store ""Muzak"" when there are so many great songs out there to cover??? (And adding insult to injury, to do them with arrangement virtually identical to the originals??) I don't get it.Perhaps next time Donny will cover some classic Motown songs with cutting edge arrangements (songs he performed extraordinarily well during the concert segments of the 70's ""Donny & Marie"" Show), Stevie Wonder or other songs. (Or even more Broadway tunes, such as ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miserables and other classic shows would have been wonderful compared to this.)"
2,Number One on the NYT Nonfiction List with a bullet!,"I suppose the only thing that confounds liberals even more is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" soon to be the biggest film blockbuster of all time is #2 on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction.Great book, great voice for many who will be heard this November when the Flim Flam Man, John F. Kerry goes down in ignonimous defeat. Keep up the great work Sean and keep doing your part to defeat the unholy trinity of terrorism, despotism, and liberalism."
1,Find something better,"Thing is like 20 feet long, and the clip is retarded. The pictures make it look sick, but it's not. It's hard to clip on, it's not even a clip. It's just a gap of plastic where you have to jam your headphone cord or whatever in between it. If your cord isn't thick enough, fold it and try again. It's a piece of s***t really is what it is."
1,Died after 2 years of use,I used it twice a month for 2 years & one day it just stopped working. The motor was still spinning but on less speed & couldn't cut anything.It's heavy & the blade gets dull relatively fast compare to other machines. I am looking for a different manufacturer or model now.
2,Large drainer stops the fustration!,"Excellant large - perfect for 4 adult household. I said scratch to the dishwasher and am washing by hand, everyone has to do their own dishes - fabulous!"
2,Great sound...YES.....great value? NO,"I bought these for my GF to use on her recent trip to China. She loves them on the plane. Once she got home, I had a chance to 'test' them out. I tried mowing the lawn with them tonight and here is what I found:Pros:Great noise cancellation. That's a no brainer. they are built for itSounds great...trebble..bass...all thereComfortable and lightCons:Only two volume selection: high and low. I had the Ipod volume on max and it didn't seem that loud.Sweaty ears. Man did I sweat after taking them off. It wasn't that hot outside either. You'll get sweat all around the ear piece. I don't know if that's leather or vinyl.Flimsy cord-the cord is very small. I was afraid I might get tangle while mowing and pull the wires apart. I wish it could slightly thicker.OVerall a great sounding headset. I wished I had more time to research different brands before settling on the Bose. She is my princess and deserves the best!!!"
2,Handy iPAQ accessory,This foldable keyboard is great for allowing the use of your PDA as a mini notebook. It is compact and light. I use it when I am flying. It is also great at home when I have large entries to make because it has a jack that allows for the iPAQ to run on AC instead of the battery.
2,Excellent camera,I have had the c-5060 for almost a year and am very happy with the camera. The wide-angle lens is great for landscape photos. I find that the amount of post-processing I need to do with photos from this camera is minimal. Sharpness is always good right off the camera. It also handles contrasty scenes very well and doesn't overexpose as much as other cameras I have owned.
1,One of 2003's worst.,"Eliza Dushku is gorgeous, let's just get that out of the way because that is the only reason to see this movie.The plot of this movie is one we've seen time and time again. Teenagers make a ""wrong turn"" and end up lost or stranded in a dangerous place. But what's the scary thing about this movie? Well, imbread West Virginians of course. Seriously, couldn't we think up of a more frightening killer than imbread West Virginians? It's pretty cheesy. Even though the movie does have some tense moments and a few ""pop out and scare yous"", it still fails to earn your money.Rent it."
2,Great Album,Love this album. We are friends of Eric Stone and love his music. If you like Trop Rock than you'll love Eric Stone.
1,"not the best guide, but not bad","Peterson's guide was my first as a child, so I don't want to bad mouth it, but it is not the best. Since then I have used just about every other guide available. Peterson's seems to have fallen behind in several areas. The illustrations are not as good as those in the National Geographic guide. The accidental and exoctic species are listed seperatly at the end of the book, and not all of the birds listed are shown!!! Im not sure if this is a mistake or not. Accidentals are also shown seperately, not alongside similar species or birds with similar appearance. This makes it somewhat confusing to identify some birds. Very little information is given about them, and usually there is nothing more than a head shot. I wouldn't use it as a primary reference, but it does make a good companion to other guides, especially ones with photographs rather than watercolors."
2,Better Invention than the Wheel,Can't recommend this enough if you've got a dog that pulls. I can walk again! Had to watch the dvd to figure out how to put it on my five minues later all my problems were solved.
2,Powerful Pop-Rock,"Since the 1970's the Italian musician Renato Zero has been making highly original pop and rock music with meaningful and intelligent lyrics. Zerolandia (1978) is one of his most satisfying albums. The melodic, hook-laden ""La favola mia"" (My Story) open the album on a high note, being one of those poprock powerballads that becomes addictive after the second listen. ""Io uguale io"" (I equals I) is equally catchy, while ""Triangolo"" is a fast number with lovely strings and soaring vocals. ""Sesso o esse"" impresses with its unusual synth effects, while ""Fermati"" is a gentle ballad. ""Amaro Madely"" starts like a radio playing an old song from the 1930's before developing into a dramatic ballad. ""Una guerra senza eroi"" (War without heroes) with its marching beat is another catchy song, and the sax-heavy ""Uomo, no"" concludes his varied and enjoyable album. Zero's great talent lies in his integration of the tension and urgency of rock with the melodicism of the Italian popular song."
1,Stroller okay... Carseat HORRIBLE!!!!,"We purchased this travel system in another pattern in October 05. I don't mind the stroller, our 6 month old seems very comfortable in it. However, we have had endless problems with the infant seat!!! First of all, you can only use the carseat with the base (there are no slots to slide a seatbelt through on the carseat itself) We have two vehicles and it has been a real pain transfering and readjusting the base everytime! Second, our baby is only 6 months old and 15 pounds and for the last two months has felt too heavy for the seat. We are already seeing white distress marks on the handle! I loved the pattern of the set, and that is unfortunately the only thing I was looking for at the time so, please DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!"
2,nice,nice little radar for the money. does what it says it does. kind of loud and sends alerts right away.
2,Glad I bought it,"I'm an avid reader but I was often disappointed with my book choices. I love writers like Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, and Zola. I wanted to find others like them. So far, the authors I have read from Daniel Burt's selections are superior writers as well as writers that I might not have found on my own. I recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading books that have no lasting value."
2,"Moore, please","This is a highly worthwhile addition to the original DARK FUTURE series written largely by Jack Yeovil (Kim Newman) back in the 1980s. Moore, a former editor then freelance writer at DC Comics, makes the mileau his own. I'm looking FWD to reading the sequel REALITY BITES.I've bought but not yet read the other new DF books and look FWD to them as well as MORE new books from Moore et alia."
2,Very nice,I've had no problems with this watch. It keeps good time and works well. It's actually a bit smaller than I thought it would be. This is a good watch if you have small wrist like I do. One thing I like is the band doesn't seem to pull my arm hair like watches I've had in the past.
1,Farouk Chi Pro GF 1505 Overrated,"Bought this in Jan. 2009 and was quite pleased until this morning when there was no more heat coming out. A blow dryer that only lasts 1 1/4 years, at this price, is not a great investment. It was never used more than a few minutes every few days. Really feel this was not worthwhile for such a short time. It seems others have had this issue too. Would not recommend this dryer."
1,Not as advertised,Product was advertised as NEW but it had been opened. With this type of paper it needs to be brand new to confirm that it hasn't been exposed to light. Had to ship back. Company refunded $$ but I had to pay shipping back.
1,Warning for small business users,"If you have a two-line phone system and a two-line answering machine, then this printer is not going to work for you if you need the fax feature. You don't learn this until you start to have problems. Then you read that the supplied telephone cable is a 2-wire cable and that your answering machine must be connected to the printer.Considering the printer is called an ""OfficeJet"", it's not very office friendly! I am amazed! What were they thinking when they designed this product?"
1,for whom the bell tolls,"the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?"
1,"Poorly Coated, but Worth It if You Find it On Clearance","The size is perfect for the Black and Decker Countertop Convection oven Model T01675W. (This model can hold a 9 inch pie pan or cake pan.)There is plenty of room for the heat to circulate around the sides of each ""pan"" in this set.However,I found, like other reviewers, that the non-stick coating is poorly/cheaply applied. Only after a few uses and washings it started to come off.(And I did not scrub it hard and only used a soft sponge.)Since I found this identical set at Marshalls for $10, I still consider it worth the money as the Black and Decker parts would have cost me 4x as much (plus S/H). However, I would not pay the $16-$20 that Amazon has been and currently is charging for it."
1,I HATE THEM!!!!,"When I first saw them at the store I thought... nah, they look like they leak. So I bought elite from evenflo. Well my dear mother in law arrived to visit us one day with 7 of these bottles, so to be polite I sterilized one and used it. My daughter hated it because she was used to the wide nipple and I hated it myself because the bottom wouldn't stop leaking. Plus, the nipple collapsed. Can't store made formula in them, can't use them with a bottle warmer, and so on.I wonder if the bottles were tested at all."
1,Look Elsewhere,"The writing in this book is just bad, more like a first novel than a classic. I couldn't get into the plot because the stilted style kept pulling me out of the story. I made it about 50 pages and couldn't stand any more. On to something else."
2,Sony's got a winner,"This is an excellent system. The sound stage on this system is excellent, its quite versatile, you can hook it up to video game systems, dvd players etc. Excellent dolby surround, plus 60 cd space is hard to beat, I love how this system looks the colorful display it's just like a mini jukebox. 225 watts, excellent price....I love it....I give it 5 stars...Sony rocks"
1,Utterly frustrating,"Indeed it would have been nice if Motorola Phone Tools would work under OS X, but I wasn't really counting on it in the first place.However, even for a computer addict like me it's cumbersome to say the least, to get it working (after removing all modem drivers, which can be impractical for internetters..). I've been corresponding with their helpdesk for over two weeks now, and although I got it running, it still won't see files that are on the phone (Motorola V3i). The other way around, the phone doesn't see files that are put on it in Phone Tools.Not to mention it won't read addresses from the phone. Updating it to 4.0.4 doesn't help. I didn't even try using Bluetooth, since I hear nothing but doom-stories about it.I can't believe a large number of people use this, since most users give up on software that doesn't work after under 5 minutes."
1,Bootleg,I purchased this because of the picture and that it said it was the official headband. I was shipped a bootleg headband that was falling apart upon opening the package. Very disappointed.
1,Poor design,"I bought this camera recently and added also bought a padded carrying case for it. During a football game, I returned it to its case, latched the cover, and set it on the seat beside me. I stood up, and brushed it off the bench; it fell approximately 18 inches - in a padded case. This short and padded fall broke the camera! Kodak refuses to repair what appears to me to be a very fragile product. If you buy this product, treat it like an fresh egg (or a rotten egg as far as I am concerned. So much for buying American.)"
1,PLEASE BEWARE!!!,"You have no warraranty on this product if you purchase through Amazon. Usually, that would not be a big deal, but chances are you will have problems. Ours is shooting sparks after a year and a half. After reading the reviews on Folica's site, this is not uncommon. It's a lot of money to spend for that length of time.Also note, if you do buy from an authorized dealer on T3's short list, it has to be registered within 21 days of purchase to be valid.It is quiet and light, but others will give better performance."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this book based upon the positive reviews. I am an avid reader and for the first time ever I returned a book based upon poor quality and even worse writing/story development.The main focus of the story revolves around the actions of Cassandra and Lukien, two of the most shallow and selfish characters I've come across. I couldn't find anything redeemable about either. Yet, Akeela, who is quite admirable in the beginning, changes everything (and loses his own sanity) based upon these worthless individuals. Is the message that beauty or physical strength are more important than all other personal traits combined? Frankly, the story made me nauseous.Do yourself a favor- don't waste the money..."
1,It was fun for the 2 hours before it broke,"Our AirZooka lasted 2 hours. My grandson used it for maybe 30 minutes the first night. The second evening he used for about 90 minutes (not continously by any means)and the launcher broke. Yes, it was only $15 but he was really disappointed - and I can think of alot of things I would do with $15!"
1,So disapointed,My son received this as a gift and it took 2 adults and glue to put it together! Totally defeats the purpose of having this toy. We found it would not stay together without the glue. The lightest touch would cause the entire thing to collapse. If he hadn't seen the toy out of the box we would have thrown it out or returned it. With all of the initial positive reviews I seriously wonder if there has been a recent redesign from the initial product. Quality of this product is terrible.
2,Abstract and darkly passionate,"This record was a major challenge to both the traditionalists and the emerging avant-garde. Jeanne Lee was a pioneer of avant-garde singing, graced with a haunting, hypnotic voice. Ran Blake's piano explores the internal structures of harmonies with delicate colourations. The Newest Sound Around is an intriguing, strange mesh of piano and vocal sounds delivered with a passionate tenderness.The novel approach contrasts strikingly with the material: standards such as ""Summertime"" and ""Lover Man"", and traditional gospel such as ""Motherless Child"". But this is the great idea behind the album: new sounds will penetrate the unprepared ear more profoundly if wrought from familiar material.The album cover boldly proclaimed that this music ""may well be the beginning"" of ""an enduring new wave in jazz styling"". Well, by definition, no new wave can be enduring, nor should it be. Jeanne Lee remains one of jazz's most original, individual and compelling vocalists."
1,Dated and no great revelations,No great discoveries here. Wethern tells about how much the Hells Angels partied and used drugs in the 70's and the beginning of methamphetamine distribution. The book drags and bogs down. I recommend Under and Alone instead of this book.
1,It would be a terrific CD if....,"This CD release if NOT the complete double-LP. A number of tracks were omitted. As such, I urge you to procede with caution, by checking the track list against the LP to determine if any of your favorite tracks were chopped."
1,"Should be called ""Advertisements for Kids"" ... where is the Geography?","I ordered this magazine for my son expecting the same level of quality articles as National Geographic Magazine has but, written at a kids level. After seeing two issues full of advertisements pushing things like: junk food, Video Games and Movies and even a review of video games, I am cancelling the subscription. This magazine is very disappointing and not at all up to expectations. All parents should cancel and send a message to the owners of this junk magazine that is doing nothing more than pushing advertising on our kids. Stick to a high quality magazine like National Wildlife's Ranger Rick."
1,Revisited but not improved,I have this problem with Scott Card's children -- they read about 12 years older than they are supposed to be and it's definately the case in this work which revisits Ender Wiggin's childhood but from a very different point of view. In the notes Scott says he was originally going to open this to other authors. I think he should have. It's a not very good sequel that lacks the power of Ender's Game.
2,"Good for Beaders, Embroideriers, and Quilters","As with all Interweave Press publications, this starts with a historical overview of bead embellishments including some beautiful pictures and samples.There are several stitches shown with many texturing ideas offered for use in the various projects. They start from simple pocket fringe to a wonderful Sashiko Vest - assembly instructions are included with this project.A chapter is devoted to designing for bead embroidery with discussions of how stitches effect the finished look of a piece. You will also find information on color.The gallery is actually two sections. Two pages are devoted to a few of the Bead Quilt squares created in memory of the September 11th, 2001, attacks. The other section is lovely in that it show a few of the possiblities inherent in bead embroidery.Overall it's an excellent book and a good addition to any beader's, embroiderier's, or quilter's library."
2,YES,"Not exactly a naturally smelling lemon aroma, but at least this one doesn't make me feel bad; whereas others have. And if you are vacuuming pet hair, it helps quite a bit."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"If you want to read about the New York City draft riots, do not read this book. As other reviewers have stated the book draggs on and is rediculously repetitive. In addition, the wording of the book makes for a very boring read, and becomes quite confusing at times.Knowing little about the Draft Riots, I was hoping to learn something. But what I realized, however, is that in order to read this book you must know much about the political history of New York, and have a great desire to learn about trade unions.How this type of book was released by Oxford press is beyond me. In any case, I found this book to be a waste of time and energy with little use or worth. I would not recommend it at all"
2,Very Cool Album,"Not really interested in the Rock tracks, but ROBI DRACO ROSA has recorded some great music. Rosa has a good voice, similar to Ricky Martin. The Best Song from the album is ""Crash Push"". It's worth buying the entire CD alone. Incredible slow track... ""Crash Push"" is excellent. Another great track is ""Como Me Acuerdo - Do You Remember."" The DVD Extra makes the purchase even more worth while; it's a great look at the making of ""mad love"" album and very cool 2 music videos in one ""Dancing In The Rain / Lie Without A Lover"""
1,DiZ iZ dE aNtHuM tHrOw aLL yO hAnDz uP,"Remember back when life was great, before GC were born......Once again, the irony is SO DELICIOUS :)"
2,Smurfs are back!,"This is a great smurf product! I ended up super gluing some of the small parts on so they didn't get lost. Overall it is cute and because the roof comes off, it makes a great place to store other smurfs!"
1,BEWARE,"If I could, I wouldn't give a single star. Don't be a fool--this could be considered commercial cheating. In fact, the bonus CD has nothing to do with Diana Ross at all! And the person who wrote the liner notes was even intelligent enough not to sign. There's much better than this; this is going very low."
2,What fun!,"At Christmas I found all sorts of fun and useful food gifts to make from this book. Homemade liqueurs, jellies...If you like to cook and hate all the extra ingredients in processed foods, this one's a keeper."
2,it's really really helpful,"Most of us engineering students started physics in high school, which is algebra based. Then we go onto college and the physics classes there use calculus. Now unless you are a math and physics super student, then you should probably buy this book. To me, it seems to just give enough calculus. Some other books - the one used in my school for example, gives too much calculus and confuse the heck out of me. But this book puts concepts as the number one priority, and caculus as the secondary priority. Once the concepts are conveyed to the reader, the calculus seems to fit onto the concepts kind of naturally almost. I like that approach, plus the fact that the author can really explain things really well makes this a great book for all students struggling in college level calculus based physics classes."
2,enchanted knitting,"The patterns in this book are many, and very nice, from all over the world. Not all of them are usable, but that's a matter of appeal. Most patterns are quite big to knit up, not for small projects. You have to copy and enlarge them first because they're printed very small."
1,"Somewhat OK for Reference, Bad for Test Preparation","I bought these thinking that Microsoft would be in the best position to write a training kit to prepare for the certification tests, since they are, after all, Microsoft tests. Big mistake. If I hadn't used the Transcender practice tests also, I would have gotten a rude awakening at the test center. The MS books have some decent reference information, but they don't prepare you for the tests."
1,Don't last very long at all.......,"I bought this to go with my cordless 20v Dewalt set of tools. This might not be so much the fault of the blade, as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set. Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard, you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade, and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw. If you have the same set of tools, or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade, then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with, and the rest of the blade is still perfect, but utterly useless.I have used other brands, with far better results, these are throw away blades, in my opinion."
2,MENSA Logic Puzzle meets Board Game,"WOW! I love this game! There are a lot of great games out there these days, especially with the new European style games becoming more available in the US. Even amongst all these games, Ricochet Robot ranks up there as one my favorite games of all time. This is mental stimulation at its best!I have to admit that this game is not for everyone and I have a hard time finding people to play this game with due to its brain-draining nature. It does not have the strategic or tactical depth of chess, but it is on par for mental stimulation.The best way to describe this game is; a MENSA logic puzzle in a board game."
2,It sure was a good decision to buy this one!,"I had already owned Peter Gabriel's ""So"" and ""Us"" before I decided to get this fine collection of his solo material, some of which I was familiar with. Besides ""Sledgehammer"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Don't Give Up"", ""Red Rain"", and ""Big Time"" (Where's ""In Your Eyes"", anyway?), all from ""So"", my other favorites are ""Solsbury Hill"", ""I Don't Remember"", ""Shaking The Tree"" itself, ""San Jacinto"", the new-for-this-collection ""Here Comes The Flood"", the particularly strange and bizarre-lyric-filled ""Games Without Frontiers"", and my absolute favorite ""Shock The Monkey"", albeit in edited form, as opposed to the version I heard on the radio. So, now, beside fellow Genesis veteran Phil Collins' ""Hits"" CD, this is a must for anyone's adult-contemporary collection. I'd recommend it heavily!"
2,"Not my choices, but WHO CARES?","This book, as the title states, is a compilation of the author's choices for Best Picture, Actor, and Actress from 1927-1991. It's not on the same level as Peary's ""Guide for the Film Fanatic,"" because cult films aren't included (obviously) and it's Peary's love for more obscure, curious films that I feel rates his books higher than Ebert's or Kael's. I don't think the book is meant to degrade the Academy as much as it is to expose readers to some lesser-known or underappreciated performances (I can only assume he's a big fan of Chaplin). Whatever Peary's reason for writing it, his analyses of the films and of the performances that he cites as best in every year are well-written and thorough, and this book is a treat for anyone who enjoys reading about film."
2,"Works Good, Easy To Clean","This hand blender is not only stylish, but does a great job of blending smoothies and whipping potatoes. It is also good for whipping home made butters and lotions. The bottom part comes off and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleanup."
2,Great sock substitute!,I've used these off and on for years and just found them on Amazon's website. These are used in place of socks. I really like them. You cut them to size. The instructions say to handwash but I've put mine in the washing machine and let them air dry. The terrycloth feels good and keeps your shoes from smelling. I highly recommend these.
2,What A Book!,"This book is SOO timely; not necessarily because of the boy meet girl theme, but because in this book, someone dies and it sobers you; Just this year alone for me, I have known seven people to die. Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real."
2,C S LEWIS,I LOVE ALL THE C S LEWIS BOOKS AND MOVIES. I ALSO GO TO THE THEATER TO SEE THEM.. GREAT!!!!!
2,great seller,"Great product, a little smaller than my other one but no one would notice. It was for a halloween prop.Would use this seller again."
1,Too bad you can't give 0 stars,"I was so excited that the woman who shaped my pre-teen and teenage years had come out with a book that I thought would shape my mid-twenties...so I bought the hardcover 2 days after it came out. I have never been so disappointed in an author! I read the book with half interest--Blume fails to develop her characters and any sort of plot, which is sad because there was so much potential. I got the feeling that she wrote the book with the hopes of being recommended by Oprah...I hope Oprah saves her money--or she can get mine at our garage sale next week."
1,Now I know why this book wasn't reviewed by Booklist,"How sad that someone would go to all this effort to puttogether something that is basically useless. The print on the mapsis too small to read. All but 20 of the 278 pages of maps are in black and white. I thought I'd be getting something that my grandchildren could use as they were coming up through the years. There is always something about having a map that intrigues all of us, and adds a little bit more to our imaginations. When I was a junior high school librarian, I had several books of literary maps. Unfortunately, I don't remember their names. The students just loved them. Save your money on this one."
1,"A couple of impressive tracks, but still too weak.","Despite being a Chesky fan, I wasn't really pleased with this sampler. At only 48 minutes (I wonder why Chesky didn't offer a bit more, since they could have easily mastered an extra 30 minutes into the CD), there are few impressive performances in this sampler.The best track is definitely Dave's True Story's ""Dear Miss Lucy"". Excellent album. However, pretty much the rest is somewhat unimpressive.Two other exceptions might be The Coryells (Amazing sound engineering and vocals) and Rebecca Pidgeon's ""Underground"".Ana Caram's bossa nova rythms and perhaps Paquito D'Rivera's tracks might be great to test those high-end headphones or speakers.... that's pretty much all however...Overall, I expected much more from this sampler, both in quantity and quality."
2,good read,"This book was very good, it kept you wanting to know what would happen next. The characters in the story were interesting and different. A good read."
2,You can't go wrong with a horse!,"I went and saw Hilago last night and really enjoyed the movie! In fact, I had been looking forward to seeing the movie since December 5th of last year. I can truly say that this movie was worth the wait.I love horses, so any movie that centers around a horse is worth seeing to me. Hidalgo will rank on my list of horse movies to own, just like Seabiscuit, Black Beauty, and Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken.Viggo Mortensen gave a wonderful performance as Hopkins(and whether the western legend is true, Mortensen has my respect). Mortensen brought Hopkins to life in a way few could have done it.When it comes to Hidalgo's performance, I'm speechless! I have great respect for the trainer, but even greater respect for the horse! I agree with someone else who said, ""Hidalgo should win an award for his performance.""There were a few slow parts, but overall it's a keeper:) I did my share of crying and was caught up in the moment. Thanks Disney, you've done it again!"
1,Stacking Up Adobe and Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,"Adobe Photo Album's advantage is its ability to catalog photos. However, I think that more and more people are beginning to look for the ability to organize photos with other files like words and music. For ease of use and ability to link photo with titles, text, songs and songs, the newly release Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook wins hands down.[...]I want software like Adobe to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities. I'm looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use"
1,I liked my textbook better,I am also a student at BU and personally I found our textbook to be a little more helpful. Maybe that's why I am getting a B+ in our class and doofus boy below is getting a C. Ha ha!I doubt very much that the author of this book could even pass a college course with as little as he knows about the business side of PR. I don't think this book was written with any target audience in mind because it just kind of jumps all over the place. Maybe its good reading for schizos. Or people with ADD.
1,Not up to his standards,I have read and enjoyed most of Baldacci's books. This one was so contrived that the ending was a little tough to get to. So many twists and turns that I think even he got lost.
1,GREATEST HITS COLLECTION BY THE EAGLES IS WAY BETTER!,Take my advice I recommend Eagles Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 volumes one and two is the definitive collection for the hardcore music fan out there. Because I have all these classic songs on my CD albums!
1,Mundane Poison,Length:: 6:28 MinsHere's some general thoughts on this series. I ended up doing it in four parts but only one could be posted here.
2,Mobil Base,Was easy to put together. I have them mounted on some heavy shapers. Roles easy. Machines are stable when they are locked down. Does everything I wanted at a good price.
2,Explore the City,"Each time I movve through the City I find new things. Also, you can move through the levels along different paths each time that you play the game. And, you can change the order in which you play.Thief 3 has an amazing complexity."
2,Experience some gaming history!,"These are indeed old games, and as such, they don't look anywhere near as good as newer games. However, there are a bunch of classics here that should be experienced by any fan of PC gaming. If you love getting immersed inside a virtual world, practically all these games will deliver the goods. And printed manuals? Almost unheard of these days! If you are a true fan and don't mind tweaking your system a bit to get them running, there are hundreds of hours of fun to be had with this massive collection."
2,"Living, Dying, Caring: Life and Death in a Nursing Home","I read this book from cover to cover in the space of an afternoon. The true stories were engaging and poignant and the reflections provided by the authors on each situation are an invaluable resource to anyone working in healthcare.I would also strongly recommend this book to anyone with a parent or family member living in a nursing home (particularly in Australia). It gives you an insight into the day to day running of a nursing home, the dilemmas faced by staff and the quality of care which should be provided. The book includes descriptions of times when a high quality of care was provided, and also times when a situation could have been handled better. This book is also a good introduction to some of the key principles of palliative care."
2,Bratz Cloe,When Cloe Came out in Australia I Know I Had to Get Her. I have over 50 Bratz dolls and she is my fave Doll. She comes with the coolest PJs and the softest hair she is the best doll EVER!!!!
2,Great Overview of Why Railroads have come back from the dead,"Railroads Triumphant has given me an excellent history as to why railroads died, and why they are coming back. The author's explanation of the various forms of governmental intervention and how they led to the railroad's demise were enlightening. The Stagger's Act of 1980 clearly was the defining moment when the government stopped micro-managing the railroads and allowed them to serve the public again. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who thinks that railroading is dead! I also reccomend it to anyone who thinks that governmental control is good for the public.."
2,Can't understand the problems others are having,"This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke). I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface. It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device. No problems whatsoever. Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either. I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work."
2,AMAZING,"THIS IS THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION! I would suggest anyone to watch it, as I am hooked and even though I have seen every episode on TV I still find myself buying the seasons so that I own them"
1,was alright,Was not like they say it should of been. The original was way better. Always be better too.Nothing else to say about it..
1,"wrong cover, wrong album, wrong number of discs","This isn't the 2-disc ""The Complete Helen Ward on Columbia"". Corrections need to be made. I can't differentiate between the sellers' products. Your description says 1 Disc, but there are too many songs showing for one disc. Also, it appears Helen Ward sang many of these songs, but it's not the complete edition."
1,Fake and farfetched,"Roth is still a great prose stylist. And the passages on Newark were brilliant. But for a historical novel, the history is way off. The radicalism is cartoonish or worse. Other writers have tackled this fascinating subject (the 60's radicals and what became of them) and done a much better job - Marge Piercy, for one."
1,Slow and tired,This book is so slow and boring that if it was a movie you would get up and walk out. The people that gave this book 5 stars must be friends and family of the author. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because 0 stars wasn't an option.
2,Sit back and enjoy the mood,Of all the vinyl I bought in the 60s and 70s this is the one I remember best. Perfect to sit back and listen to alone or with someone special. Sip a hot cup of tea and let the best of classical music wash over you with the sounds of a San Francisco thunder shower in the background in perfect sync with the music. If my original vinyl hadn't finally worn out I would still be listening to it. The CD doesn't have the nostalgia of vinyl but it sounds as good as I remember.
1,dull and boring with random characters,"This is one of the poorest reads I've sledged through in a while. Random loosely related characters, with little depth, and a silly imaginative plot line that has many logical inconsistencies. The concept could have been handled with a one chapter short story, but instead drags endlessly on. Well almost endlessly -- thank you for finally dying, Ms. Byrd, and putting us all out of our misery."
1,Terrible crayons-Don't understand other reviews!,"I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."
2,Honor of your company -review,For all Tom paxton fans most of his song lyrics are found here.I also found out some unknown info ( Trivia) on the man himself.Did you know that Paul Simon warmed up for him on one occasion.Harry Chapin also. The book is not really an autobiography and is mainly taken up with Song Lyrics and where the songs came from what inspired them etc. Tom tells very little about his travels and rarely mentions the various artists that were around the coffee houses of the 60's. This is not for someone who is looking for any indepth reading. It is short of detail. Worth having for the ardent fan but disappointing that it wasn't a biography.
1,PURE CRAP!!! WASTE OF TIME!!,"I was so hoping this movie would be worth watching, yet AGAIN I was wrong. The sharks in this movie were a total joke. The so called ACTING was much much worse."
2,"Another Nancy Meyers' Gem, Simply Charming","This is the best romantic comedy I have seen this year. It has all the great elements of a truly amazing ""chick"" flick. Humor, romance, solid likable characters, foreign locations, etc. make it so great. Cameron Diaz is at her bubbly best, Kate Winslet is so charming, Jude Law is terrific, and my fave Jack Black shows his range at being utterly charming and adorable. This is such a simple film compared to the effect block busters like Eragon, etc. that it made more of an impact with me, because of the character development and solid storyline. Go Out, Watch this film and ENJOY!"
2,The movie that flies!,Chrisopher Reeve stars as the Man of Steel as he tries to save California from a devastating earthquake caused by Lex Luthor. Discover the origin of Superman and see his first rescues
1,"This item may not be square on arrival, if packaged/shipped by Amazon.","This is a precision tool. I bought this extra thick one because I need a nice square in my work. My order arrived in a box that was so poorly packed that I wonder about it retaining a real square. And this is the item I have to measure it with. This appears to be a fine tool, but you should buy it from a source that cares about packing it properly for shipment. Simply throwing it on the bottom of an over-sized box and then wadding and winding up brown wrapping paper on top of it only ensures that when it is dropped, that it can impact right on the tip and take it a degree out of square. If you need this tool to arrive in a box that does not invite damage, buy it elsewhere."
1,What the......?,"Why do both of these reviewers say they can't wait for ""Devil Within 2""? Sounds very fishy to me. Even if they liked it (which I find hard to believe), it's almost like they know what's coming and want to promote it. Hmmmm....sounds like they might have been involved in this flick from the start. Beware!!!"
2,Perfect gift for any young boy !!!,"My sister got this book for my 7 yr old son for his birthday. Once he opened it he could have cared less that there were more presants to open. We were all amazed by the quality and intricate details of the pop-ups. My 3 year old was even enamored by it. While the descriptions seemed to me to be over his head, he understood them after looking at the pop-ups. It is his favorite book and he has to read it every night before he goes to bed, and then puts it back up high on a shelf for ""safe keeping"".When did pop-ups get sooooo good???"
1,Parenthood Season 4,"I thoroughly dislike this show, but I've become addicted to it. However, the 7th episode of season 4 may have cured me because it was even more inane than usual."
2,"""Compulsory subordination for all"" (p. 15)","""Schools are intended to produce ... formulaic human beings whose behaviour can be predicted and controlled. ... Well-schooled people are irrelevant. They can sell film and razor blades, push paper and talk on telephones, or sit mindlessly before a flickering computer terminal, but as human beings they are useless. Useless to others and useless to themselves."" (pp. 26-27). ""Schools teach exactly what they are intended to teach and they do it well: how to be a good Egyptian and remain in your place in the pyramid."" (pp 15-16). ""School sequences are crazy. There is no particular reason for any of them, nothing that bears close scrutiny. Few teachers would dare to teach the tools whereby dogmas of a school or a teacher could be criticized, since everything must be accepted. School subjects are learned, if they can be learned, like children learn the catechism or memorize the Thirty-nine Articles of Anglicanism."" (p. 4)."
2,Helps with transition,"Having a new sibling can be confusing and frustrating. This book helps to answer questions children might have like ""When can my baby brother play with me?"" ""Why does he cry so much?"", etc. It presents it well so that kids can understand and it can allay some of their fears. My niece really enjoyed this book when her little brother was born, I think my mom read it to her 10 times in one day."
2,"A ""detailed"" Pirates game","Very detailed game that should provide a more hard-core and detail oriented person some time-alone fun for many, many hours. Visually exciting with a steep learning curve, this game offers the opposite of the ""Sid Meier's Pirates"" gaming work load. Very hands on and all the small details are on you, the gamer. Avoid the easy-to-aquire cheats: Will ruin the gaming experience. I purchased the game for a low price, so overall good buy."
1,BEWARE; author is a scam artist...,"I could not even get through the first chapter despite repeated effort and vigilant prayer.... I have since had the misfortune of a lengthy relationship with the man that claims to be this author (he is pictured in the books) and know him to be predator, a liar, a thief and a disgrace to the Christian faith. His ""ministry"" has damaged the walk of many Christians and brought shame upon the Christian community. Please pray for him but DO NOT support his works."
2,Love this color,"Such a pretty, fun, bold color to wear out. Always get so many compliments when I'm out and about. Definitely recommend."
1,not worth the time,"i've read all the pendragon books. but when i think about them i can only remember the story up to the middle of the Aurther book, the rest is just a blur. WHEN I TRIED to read this book i found myself getting side-tracked,(for long periods of time i would just sit there and stare at the pages, or the wall), this book is really boring. After 2 years i'm on page 45 or 50 or something. And i can't stand the christian theme. i don't beleive in god so i can't relate to this book."
1,SugarDispenser,"I bought this container for an easy way to hold a 5lb bag of sugar/ However, the lid doesn't fit tight. Very disappointed"
2,Best for winter itch and dry skin,Years ago while living in Chicago I suffered from the worst winter itch of my life. A friend told me about Mantle cream and I've been using every day.
2,Baby book,"Cute book, arrived with seam coming apart. We fixed it and it seems to be ok now. The kit inside is very nice to have. I believe it will be a great book just the one problem, but pages are nice and book is nice."
2,Wonderful!,"This a great workout if you have only 45 min and I think that the description is misleading. Most people will think they would not be able to get much for the 10 min segments but trust me, they are all fiery and you really feel like you have seriously worked out afterwards. Jeanette is her usual bubbly self and guides you through a wonderful 45 min which makes you sweat and feel wonderful afterwards. A great buy!"
2,ALL HAIL THE NEW MASTERS OF METAL!,"Lamb Of God is one of the most intense bands to ever grace my cd player! from the second i put my head phones of, I was rewarded with some of the most insane and powerful metal I have heard in a long time! It restores your faith in the music industry! when a band with amazing drumming, pounding, blunt bass lines, shreding guitars and gut wrenching vocals comes along! I had the honor of seeing them yesterday, and I must say It only gets better live!! Randy is one of the most charismatic front men I have ever seen. He was able to keep the crowd going even though he was a lil drunk! His stage presence reminded me of that of Iggy Pop, truly stand out! But Lamb of God ain't no Punk band! these guys are pure american metal! and are worth ever penny!"
2,A real treasure!,This is a great movie! Ignacio Lopez Tarso perfoms tremendously! I highly recomend it.
2,"great recipes, poor construction.","I love the cookbook and have found it immensely helpful in terms of feeding a family of four. However, I wish that it was put together a bit more carefully as the cover has torn off after only a year of use. More solid construction of the book, especially if little ones are using it, would make sense."
1,Hated it,"Was expecting more flavor...it just tasted like regular cappuccino nothing with flavor. i thought I was purchasing flavor, as the title suggested."
2,Fun But Trying,Twilight Princess is a wonderful game. Awesome graphics and an old so familiar concept. Once again you must deliver Hyrule from the hands of the deviant Ganondorf. The graphics are great and it feels good. Using the Wiimote just feels natural in this game. Now for the bad part. Fishing with the Wiimote is a hassle. Annoying and frustrating come to mind as words to use for this requirement. You could literally be stuck for hours trying to catch one fish. I've tried various methods and none really seem to help. You just either catch it or you'll get frustrated and give up. Also there is a major glitch in the game where if you save in a particular area you are pretty much done. I've not seen any tips for getting out of it. Other than these two concerns the game play is fine. I've not played the GameCube version of the game to see if it fares any better but its a good game for the Wii (other than fishing).
1,(yawn),"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Not unlike watching the hundred hour previews before the Oscars or SuperBowl... lots of glitter, much pomp, much applause (especially for old favorites)and a couple of good bits. Best taken in small doses."
2,What Marcel saw,"Maybe has-been harlots of the Belle Epoque affected, entre elles-memes, the wit of Wilde characters, which American actors render under direction in fleeting Hollywood Edwardian. The accents come and go chasing the screenplay's segues first to Colette's very different style and then to more modern takes on women's wares and tears, all to dress up and down what two people are deciding nobility obliges. Together Hampton, Frears and Friend keep the tale's surprise. While Lea has been no nanny but doubly nude throughout, a delicately draped performance by Pfeiffer, Friend's dandy shows himself, in retrospect, the moralist at his wit's end. The only touch missing is a real picture of Kathy Bates when she was an ingenue of the first water, as her character in the corps de ballet."
2,Great for Training Treats,"I have used these as training treats for better than a year. My maltese loves them. I don't find them to have a bad odor in the least. They are soft, so easily cut into tiny pieces for training. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.I feel they are safe and healthy for the little furbabies!"
2,not the item pictured,"great beginner board, although the one i recieved is not the red ""retro "" style as shown.(which is also the one i wanted when i ordered). The board i recieved was a blue standard shape tri-fin. so check on this if you are set on a specific style. Still a great deal for an entry level board."
1,So so very sad,"I watched the remake series of Land of the Lost when I was a kid and loved the series, and later I watched the original as reruns on tv land. They were both great, adventurous, entertaining shows. This movie is horrible. It simply makes fun of the stories that were these great shows. I knew the moment I saw the advertisments for this movie that it was going to be bad. Especially when it was announced that it would star Will Farrel. At that point I knew that this movie was going to be nothing more than stupid jokes aimed at making fun of the original shows.So glad I avoided going to see this in the theater."
1,It will probably will not fit your cabinet,I bought it. It designed for doors that do not close on a frame. This means - it not relevant for most doors I know. In other words - not a standard dimension.
2,Felt like I was in Spain!,"Although I was familiar with only 1 of the songs on this CD, all the songs are now my favorites!Easy to listen to. I'm so glad that I bought it!"
1,Pass this one by,"This short video is poorly produced, with the blaring noise and cheap graphics of the intro taking a significant portion of the half-hour runtime. Admittedly, many kid videos like these have ""cheesy"" or silly actors and actresses, but the narrating actress appears to have been chosen to keep the many men she talks to smiling at her looks and gushing naivety. I had hoped to find a DVD version of ""All About Heavy Construction Equipment"". This isn't it. Only a few trucks are featured, and compared to other videos it just doesn't measure up."
1,What The Heck...????,"Is this an aberration or a ""new direction""? If its the former, glad to hear it. If its the latter, thanks its been fun but I'm done.You ever read a book and think....what was/is going on with this author that this book is the result? Thats how I felt about this book.Maybe its just me, but having your main character screwing around every chapter with another male with an enormous schlong and calling it ""characer development"" is laughable to the extreme.If you're a Jean-Claude or Richard fan, BEWARE !!! They are badly written, dumped on, and in the case of Richard, unbelievably mangled. Ah, but not to worry, Anita has a new instant soulmate, Micah. A character so flimsy and useless the most memorable thing about him is the size of his willy.You had me until this one Ms Hamilton...."
1,"Not terrible, but not great","Most of the time, even in relatively strong wind, this kite has a difficult time staying in the air. It'll fly for a while, but the balance is relatively poor, so it likes to take fast trips straight to the ground with little or no notice. :\ Oh well. It's pretty. Just not the best kite."
1,Don't try this at home folks!,"It took 3 years and sorting through numerous financial planners to overcome the mistakes i.e. advice offered by Quinn. At one time, Quinn was the #2 financial author. Well we all know what #2 stands for don't we?The advice in this book smells. Don't try it, you'll be sorry.Everybodies Money Book and Millionaire Next Door are good reads.Quinn is joke. Leave this book on the bookstores shelf where it belongs."
1,Watch the TV series,"Attempts to combine comedy into an action movie. Well, its not very funny and not very exciting. If you are a fan of the old TV series, you will be disappointed. Stick to the TV series."
2,Great Keyboard,"I have had this keyboard for over a year now and first off have to say that I do love it. I am an avid gamer but I am also a writer so I type * a lot *. That being said, I am also female and have longish nails. Within about 3 months the keys had no letters left on them because of the letters being scratched off. I also agree with the other user about the volume control being very extreme and I do not use it either. Those are my only complaints about this keyboard, other than that I love it and would recommend it to anyone. Gamers will also love being able to use it with Vent and having the LCD showing who is talking."
2,fun!,"This is so neat, its not as long as it looks in the picture.The sound it makes is pretty, it sounds like a running faucet when you are in the other room and could be useful for potty training a toddler who is a little shy. Usually the sound of running water helps to relax your toddler but this should work too. Its educational, and pretty sturdy, ours has been thrown around and banged against the tile floors and no cracks."
1,dell frickin sucks!!!!!!!!!!,do not waste ur money on sucky dells like this. go to ibuypower.com and they have better computers for less money. like right now i am using an ibuypower computer and its so cool and so powerful. if ur goin to buy a computer go to ibuypower!!! dont waste ur frickin money on this terrible dell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Review of Chi Running,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
2,A Good Dictionary,"Even it's small it's very usefull in a variety of situations, especially on travel, a good summary of high used swedish words."
2,effective but not convenient,"It cleans ok, but doesn't produce lots of buddles during the cleaning. The thing I don't like is that it's hard to carry it around when I go to public laundry houses. Sometimes I put it in a bag and sometimes a plastic box; when I transfer the power out, it spills all over my bathroom. It's just not convenient enough!"
1,Disapointed!,"I purchased this item for a family member and give it as a Christmas gift ,little that I knew ,item did not come with all parts .What an emberasement !My advise ""when buying present open first than check if everything there than give"" .Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XLZIMA"
2,Harry Potter: Diagon Alley; Board Game,"At the begining of this game, you don't get how to play ,but once you play it and get the hang of it you find out thet it is quite a lot of fun! I definetly recomend this game to people that want a really fun game."
1,Misconceptions,"Knowing the history and facts behind this fictional story gives alot of perspective on this paticular review. For any individual that had or has access to any of the actual public and sealed documents concerning this case, it tends to leave a great deal of food for thought.When a mistake is made by any government agency, of course, it's an embarrassment, especially considering the last couple of decades for a reminder.Some folks in this great nation are finally realizing that our government and law enforcement agencies are not infallible and that when put in a compromising position will do just about anything to save face and funds.It's not a pleasent reality that this portrays, but unfortunately true.If given the oportunity to find fact from fiction, would you take it??"
2,Enough specifics to make price worthwhile,"Couldn't get it at the library, so took a chance and bought it. I've been in business a while and just wanted supplement existing knowledge. There are some REALLY bad books in this category- I think its worth about $30. I would refer back to it."
1,Junk - Do not buy this cart,"Do not buy this cart. This cart broke the first time I used it.Samsonite Micro Mover Fold Away Luggage CartI loaded this cart with 2 carry-on items weighing approximately 15-20 pounds apiece - legal carry-on items, a soft small duffel bag and a backpack. The fitting that attached the leg on the cart broke as I turned away from the check-in counter at the airport. The leg was attached to the cart with a plastic fitting - the weak point on the cart. When the fitting snapped the cart was useless because the wheel was attached to the leg.I thought that this would be a good lightweight cart but the construction was too flimsy. If I were to consider a lightweight fold-up cart I would pay more for substantial metal fittings.I subsequently had to purchase a small metal cart for more money. However, it lasted the rest of the trip - several countries and many airports."
1,Ruined disc,When I need to relax I do it by watching these old video episodes of the old Hawaii five-0. I recognise the way of living and enjoy looking - and laughing at the stories. Though by not checking every disc to be allright prior to running them I discovered too late that one disc was ruined at the purchase. It is impossible to see any of the episodes of disc six. Make sure this doesnt happen to you.
2,Solomon-Kaylee Parsons,"This was an excelent read with exicting cliff-hangers at all the right times. I loved the fact that if one of this mixed up family was missing no one could function. Every one needed each other. Although Solomon didn't want to follow in his father, Moses' footsteps he still did what he was told. Solomon was very curious about everything and sometimes it got him in trouble. Solomon was a great read for any age. I also loved the fact that this is a book of forida heritage. As many know Florida history books are few and far between. It ws truly an awesome book."
1,Wish the lenses were bigger & darker - even though I ordered large!,"Good concept. Just wish the lenses were bigger an perhaps less flat across the lenses. The lenses smash against my dog's eyes. Tried adjusting the nose piece to prevent this. But after a few steps, the glasses don't stay in place and continue to smush his eyes. I have a pit bull mix with a pretty broad nose. This may work well for other breeds. Also would like the lenses to be darker. They seem fairly light. They are much lighter than in the pictures."
1,It Stinks,"Absolutely lousy. This is a photocopy of what was a marvelous original, and the photocopy stinks. This is unfortunate, as the content is very worthwhile."
1,*YAWN*,"This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. Each scene is so slow. The storyline is cliche and predictible. I knew exactly what would happen next with each scene, and how it would end. Theres also nothing scary in this movie. The parts that are suposed to be scary just have a little girl slowly walking around with cheesey camera effects and then she'll stab or strangle someone. Most of this movie is just dull empty hallways, and a bunch of little girls staring at each other and talking in monotone voices. To sum it all up this movie absolutely sucks, and if it scares you, your a pansey."
1,What the heck??,"Ok, I am not even sure what version I have...but it is NOT what I expected! I wanted the regular Rudolph story, instead, I got something with an abominable snow monster that eats reindeer and a mountain man that rips his teeth out?! I wanted some Xmas stories for my 2yr old...this is not what I had in mind. It appears that just about every reviewer received a different book here? Extremely disappointing."
2,It's all in fun,"I started watching this show in the middle of Season 2.I have started a collection, posters, O postive True Blood beverage and Seasons 1 and 2.True Blood has all things packed in one hour. SEX, VIOLENCE, GOOD MUSIC, DRAMA,COMEDY,EMPATHY and a few WHAT THE HELLS. The cast, crew and writers are excellant.My neighbors and I are actually planning a Season 3 True Blood bash when the first eposide shows. In my opinion this is great entertainment. It's there for those who chose to watch."
2,Very Satisfying,"Like many of the books in Konemann's architectural series, this one offers copious quantities of beautiful photographs. The limited text is informative, intelligent and thankfully devoid of the quasi-theoretical nonsense that spoils so many architectural books. The critical architectural issues are explained but for the most part, the images are allowed to tell the story. Simplified, but effective plans and other diagrams complement the photos and text.In an age when so-called ""star"" architects do more talking than building, it is refreshing to see these monasteries, built with humility and a sense of aesthetic understanding that is so absent in the architectural profession today.I also recommend Lucien Herve's wonderful B+W photographs in ""The Architecture of Truth: Thonet Abbey"""
1,I waited two years for this?,"I'm very disappointed... a couple suprising things happen, out of 600+ pages of the first WoT novel I've actually found hard to stay with. It took me a few days to finish it, since I kept getting bored with the lack of plot advancement. RJ, we know you can do better than this. You've proven it, so why are you leaving us with virtually nothing new until book #11?"
1,$55 for the battery or $129 for the kit!?!?!,"I have the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit and one of the batteries started not holding a charge. So I brought it upstairs to my computer and typed in the model (1234) and found this page. They want $55 for the battery. You can buy the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with TWO of these exact batteries ($110 purchased individually) and that means the charger and drill itself cost $19.That's just stupid.So I bought another kit. Instead of spending $55 for one battery, I spent $129 and now I have TWO drills, THREE good batteries and TWO chargers.In other words, unless you are flat broke, you're better off buying another kit than you are just replacing a bad battery."
2,Works great!,"Not sure what to say about this except that it works great for my husband, who is a beginner guitar player. We have it sitting on carpet in a somewhat heavy traffic area of our home and have never had any problems with it."
1,Headbands Cracked for Me Too,"I was given a pair of Logitech wireless headphone as a gift and loved using them with my iPod. The headband very quickly cracked and the whole headset stopped working. I loved all other features so much that I bought a second pair and tried to reinforce the headband with electrical tape right out of the box. This did not help as they headband on pair #2 cracked as well. Once cracked the wires stretch and break and the headphones then become worthless. Too bad, except for this flaw these are great headphones."
1,have tiny toes?,"Although this is listed as a toenail clipper, it only works on my smaller toes. The cutting edges have an ""over bite"" and don't open very far. The cut is smooth but many small clips are needed to clip the big toe nail and middle toe nail. Clipper feels good in the hand and is powerful enough for the job but the jaws are too close together so nails don't fit in. The cutting edge is as narrow as most fingernail clippers."
1,waste of time,"I love Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't wait to find out what became of Elizabeth and Darcy. If you want to read about the 101 ways they had sex go ahead and read this book. BORING, DULL, REPETITIVE...."
1,CHEAP CONSTRUCTION!,"I recently was given this toy by my mother. After reading the directions I spent over an hour trying to assemble this toy. The key word there was TRYING. NO I never finished assembling the toy. Most if not all of the pieces that were supposed to snap into place were not aligned with the correct holes. And the reason I didn't finished assembling it was because the top of it which is supposed to ""snap"" on like the directions say, bent. The more I tried to straighten it out the more it bent. In the end I had to return it. I would definitely highly recommend NOT buying this toy. It's more trouble then it's worth."
2,"fun, funny, easy read",really enjoyed reading this book as my son was hiking the AT. I was able to relate to the terrain and what he was experiencing when he would call me for his next shipments of food. Very entertaining and funny!
1,Throw up! Throw up!!,"I may have missed the boat here-nobody has cared enough about this to write a review in months. Maybe ol'Petey is just another one hit hip hop flava' of the month. Yet,this cd has everything a hip hop cd needs to be a big seller:boring music and lyrics,all the depth of an ashtray and the personality to match. I heard this at a party. It's the best place to hear it actually-you're too intoxicated to care how bad it really is,the noise of conversation helps drown it out and Raise up makes tha hootchies take off they shirts.This is only for those who have given up or are too young to know better.Everyone else,continue to avoid it."
2,gift,gave to best friend as a gift. She is enjoying it and the study is helping her get through the prayers!
1,Las Canciones Son Malas,"I'm not sure what's worse: The CD sound quality or the songs themselves. I'll give it to the songs - at least you'll remember the wretched CD sound quality; the songs are formulaic and forgettable. Whatever spark of creativity the Outlaws rediscovered on their previous release (Ghost Riders) had abandoned them for this effort.One wonders how ""Running"" and ""Easy Does It"" (the only tracks here that are even vaguely interesting) might have sounded in the hands of the original band."
2,Just what the title says,"This book is a collection of technical terms, mainly to allow English-speaking instructors to teach deaf pupils. It is conveniently organized into various topics (English/literature, Social Studies, Science, Math, Health, Education, Non-Academics/vocational, and General Vocabulary). It might be less useful in non-educational situations, as many of the signs are ""initialized,"" or variations of more standard signs that have been made with an alphabet handshape to indicate a specific English word. Many deaf people are not English-oriented and would not necessarily be familiar with these signs."
2,Loved it.,"I personally loved this movie dearly and am going to watch it again tonight with a group of friends. I having heard very little about this movie before seeing it so I didn't know what to expect from it. I had heard one friend of mine say it had okay acting and questionable music. Now I disagree with her. Something about this movie made me feel happy. I love Sara Rue and Kett Turton both madly. I loved watching this, and ended up teary eyed at the end. It is not a movie that everyone would love for their own reasons but I want to own it..."
2,THIS IS SO GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I totally love this game. The story of this game is excellent. The fighting scenes are very fun.It is a little hard but still great fun. The graphics are great too. The length of this is very long which makes it great because you don't finish it in like, one day."
2,"If you like Cussler, you'll like Matt Reilly!!","Although I'm not a fan of Matthew Reilly's novels, (I've only read one). I am a fan of Matthew Reilly. Calling temple a return to the pulp novels of old is an accurate statement and a compliment. Matthew puts his hero into one death defying situation after another only to have him extricate himself - yet again.It's been a while since I read this one, but it involves some idol carved from a meteorite in a Mayan temple and a team of US scientists sent to retreive it before (get this) an old Nazi and his team get it.Hungry Panthers, jet skis and jet packs (yes), the thrills never stop."
1,Not recommended for BlackBerry,"To start, other than the pulsing blue light - I love everything about this headset. I really tried to make it work. I bought both the black version Verizon puts out as well as the gray version from Best Buy. In both cases, I could not hear. The person on the other end could hear me fine but I could barely hear them. I tried everything to remedey but to no avail.The guy that the store told me that they are not rated to work with the BlackBerry products. Oh well - maybe with the next model."
1,Doesn't really smell like lavender,"I was hoping that becuase this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender. Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item. It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap. The smell isn't horrible & it lasts but it was what I had expected. I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil."
1,"product didnt work, terrible online chat support - dont buy","the product didnt work out of the box. after 5 hours of online chat support, it still didnt. the chat support was very frustrating - i kept losing the reps on the other end and being assgned reps who knew nothing of the product. apparently the reps sign off without telling you when they cannot fix your problem. this should have been an easy install because my other gear is also linksys. not so. i plan to return it tomorrow."
2,Works fantastic.,We needed a place to put all of our extra cooking equipment. So we settled on using two heavy wheeled wire shelfs in the garage. We wanted to keep the equipment as clean as possible so these filled the requirement. Have two of these and the buttons and grommets have stayed firmly attached. Highly recommend.
2,I loved this show,Pinwheel was an incredible show!!!! It had very fun and entertaining skits using puppets(kind of like Sesame Street and the Muppets). In my opinion Pinwheel was much better than the both of them. I wish I could get a copy of all the seasons.Pinwheel pinwheel spin me around....look at my ..(can't remember the word)..... and see what I found....pinwheel:)
2,What I wanted,I bought a couple for my boys and they were easy to install and have worked beautifully. I'd buy them for myself if I didn't already have others.
1,This optical splitter does not work.,"I have a HD Directv receiver and a Blu-Ray DVD player, both of which have digital optical outputs. Unfortunatley my surround sound receiver has only one input for the digital optical line. So, I looked on-line and found this splitter which has 2 input lines and 1 output line. This item claimed to automatically switch from one component to the other all by it self. Set-up was very easy, but unfortunaley it does not work, even when I turn off one of the components. No matter what I tried I could not get it to work. So I am back to manually plugging in the system I want to listen to, at least until I find a splitter that works, or upgrade to a surround sound processor that has 2 inputs."
2,Comfortable and great support for the price,"The sportaid, hernia truss double I found to be comfortable. It's easy to adjust since it has felcro to adjust around the waist. Make sure you order your waist size and not the hip size. One thing nice about the truss is that you can remove the padding. So whatever side you have the hernia on, you can remove the opposite padding. It's just a matter of getting use to the tightness around the waist area in order to adjust the padding and straps correctly on the hernia to get the proper support. I'd probably go ahead with the surgery to correct the problem than to rely on wearing the belt for the rest of my life."
1,where did Capt. Marvel go?,"After watching Thor and Capt. America with my grandchildren, I asked them where was Capt. Marvel and they did not know who he was. How sad he is lost. The serial was a lot different that the comic books I remember, as little Billy was a crippled seller of newspapers on the street then who used Shazam to become Capt. Marvel. The story line itself was interesting since the 'Scorpion' was a cheezy villian. It was great fun to watch and brought back the days, when for a dime you could see a feature picture, a b picture, a cartoon, newsreel and a serical. Popcorn was a nickel. In Spiro, OK the theater was segregated, but I loved to sit in the balcony anyway. Glad those days are gone."
1,Lexmark INFO IS MISLEADING!,"This printer is only good for xp/vista. It is on the box as it works for older printes but when you open box, only cd for xp/vista. They advertise a website, but it no longer exist. When contacting Lexmark, It's tough luck, get over it. Advised that Windows won't allow them to support the older version. This is wrong of Lexmark and Windows if this is correct. They should stand up and make things right.. They are the ones who are advertising this incorrectly...... support should be there, as long as, item in still being sold....SHAME SHAME LEXMARK!! I do not support the purchase of Lexmark products.. Lexmark is not doing what's right. Bad customer experience... after hours of searching was able to find on website, but not because of Lexmark.. Thanks to other customers for information.. I appreciate YOU!"
1,COME ON!!!!,"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten."
1,Not a good toaster,"We've owned this toaster for about a year now. I'm not sure why I've put up with it this long. It is completely inconsistent. We keep the knob between 2 and 3 and do not move it. At this setting, sometimes the toast gets completely burnt (like this morning), sometimes we get warm un-toasted bread, and sometimes it comes out perfectly (why I give it two stars instead of one star). There is also no consistency between the two sides of the toaster. Both sides will be set between 2 and 3 and will be pushed down at the same time. One side will come out burnt to a crisp while the other will be done nicely. If you want a toaster that only occassionally gives you good results at unpredictable times, this is for you."
1,Unworkable Scale,"Scale was light, appearing easy to use. Followed instructions to the tee, and scale only would work every 5 minutes or so. It gave out different weights with the same person on it, and then it would ""give-out"" entirely and not even work at all."
2,The absolute best product,My daughter stop sucking her thumb the moment I put it on and she would ask to paint her nails everyday so I would say it worked in an instant with only a minimum of discomfort she had completely stopped with compaining and all in 3 days. I have since stopped using the product and she has not started the habit back up again. I would recommend thus product 20 times over to any and everyone.
1,You Truly Can't Judge a Book By the Cover,"Sounds like a cookbook, but the nonfiction account of changes in food culture due to women's changing roles in society and the natural changes this produced in their expression in cooking is what you find inside. The book covers pre-WWII to the early 1960's and uses household names like Betty Crocker and Julia Child to draw the reader into a more detailed, gender-based analysis of cooking n American and our resultant ""Food Culture"".The book is exceedingly dry and the title is misleading. What appears to start as a tale-based journey back in time quickly degrades into a familiar feminist lament of under-appreciation and under-representation. The book even ends with a comparison of Julia Childs and Betty Friedan as ""pioneers"" for women - odd partners in the feminist movement. At 254 pages, it should have been more entertaining. But, I was fascinated to learn early cupcake mixes included dried egg."
1,Wrong Book,I bought this book for my daughters HS class and I searched for the ISBN and Title and this book came up. Well when we got it today it was completely wrong book. The book they sent me was copyright 1995 with the ISBN: 0155002139. How do you get that wrong. I don't recommend this at all.
2,This jacket is doing well in the Seattle Rain,"The jacket is well made and does in fact shed water and does not absorb it.It is warm enough to act as a fall jacket, and big enough for me to wear a hoodie underneath to warm up on cooler days.The pockets are big and while they do not seal I don't have any issues with things getting wet in them. Phone, camera, wallet all have been in the pockets and have not gotten soaked or even damp.There is one inner pocket which is handy for keeping something really safe, I use it for mail and things like that."
2,Worked for me.,"I scored 684 on my GED. I would actually say that the test questions on the book were harder than the actual test.What is most important when reading the question in this book, and the test itself, especially in ""controversial"" areas such as social studies etc, is that you can ignore whatever ""biases"" you have (or perceive the book to have, even though this perception is likely to your own biases) by carefully reading the question and ONLY considering the aspects that the question raises. So take the practice exams on the CD-ROM, read and truly try to understand any questions you might have got wrong, because within the content of the question there should not be many answers assumed incorrectly by McGraw-Hill. I think I counted only couple of question from all of them that had the 'wrong' answer, to best of my knowledge. Still, I think it was a great study book."
2,Read to your babies,"My five-year-old son and I have had great fun with this book for years. The gentle prose is great for reading aloud, and the illustrations, with their many fine-art allusions--to Manet, Seurat, and others--introduce children to cultural heritage in a non-preachy way."
1,Friction,I am sorry to say that everyone I have used this on has stated that it felt like it was being dragged along their skin causing a friction effect. Might go for the more expensive cover. Hopefully that will feel better to them!
2,Great value,"This clamp is great! It's much bigger than I expected, I purchased it for jewelry making. My only complaint is that it came in a really beat up Amazon box and it was COVERED in grease. Annoying to clean up, but works great. Apply a little goo gone and some elbow grease and you're set. A great value for the price."
1,sits too upright for newborns,"I didn't notice how much more upright the Delightful Dream Bouncer was than other bouncers until we assembled it, tossed the box away & attempted to use it. In other words, too late to return to the store. It was totally useless until our daughter was around 2 months old. I then realized that all the activity stuff comes up from the left side, and my daughter couldn't reach the play things with her right hand at all, which she tends to favor. Unless you have a left-handed newborn who can sit upright soon after they are born, this bouncer isn't a good choice. I highly recommend buying the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncer instead. My daughter LOVES it! You can use it right after your baby is born and it will definitely keep their interest!"
2,Not Your Average Ozzy Album,"This album is kind of different than Ozzy's previous two or any to follow. It is very good though. It is a little more pop oriented, and a little more moody. Jake Lee's guitar playing is just as good as anything, though. Center Of Enternity is the best song on the album, and one of Ozzy's all-time best. Some lame songs, like So Tired keep this from being Ozzy's best album ever . I love all of it, though. The title track is one of Ozzy's most famous songs, and it is very good."
2,"Great Box Set, A must for your collection",This is a great collection of John Lee Hooker to covers his entire career. This is a must for all John Lee Collectors.
1,brianbot,"Brian sings wonderful old songs, but there is no heart or soul. Sounds like he is singing each song for the 1000 time, which he is."
1,A waste of good paper,"This is a terrible book. I hated it so much that I couldn't stand to have it on my bookshelf and prompty took it out and left it on the street. There is no way that this book should have been published. The photographs are terrible in every way: no style, no technique - nothing. It's a shame to see paper and ink wasted on such worthless content."
2,Excellent,"Loved it. Definitely one of the best academic treatments of Lilith out there. HOWEVER, I will tell you that there are a number of instances in this book where I feel that Hurwitz is trying to make direct literary comparisons and/or character associations to Lilith without sufficient evidence. I'm not saying he is wrong in ALL of these comparisons, but I do think that there are times when he doesn't sufficiently support his claims.All in all...an excellent piece of work.I definitely recommend it!"
1,Works- sort of,"I got an Opteka T-mount to adapt a reflective telephoto lens for my Canon. It arrived with the lens and seemed fine, sturdy and well fitted. While it worked properly at first, after a couple of days the inner threaded sleeve came loose from the outer housing, allowing the lens to rotate freely and wobble a bit. It still holds the lens on the camera but makes the lens unreliable; I've ordered a replacement (from a different vendor) that hopefully will hold together."
1,Huh? What? What time is it?,"Oh, sorry... fell asleep again. That seems to happen every time I put this on. You know how everyone describes a CD by saying ""this sounds like X crossed with Y?"" Well, watch the 11:10PM weather forecast on a really small market local newscast (preferably where it snows a lot), then filter in a really boring AA meeting, and you'll have ""A Ghost Is Born.""In many Wilco reviews, there are phrases like ""takes a while to sink in"" or ""takes repeated listenings."" That is what people say when they really mean ""this sucks, but I'm going to force myself to like it, since everyone else does."""
2,DGS-2208 - Good solution for inexpensive gigabit,"The D-Link DGS-2208 is a good solution for upgrading to inexpensive to gigabit capability. Requires that NICs be gigabit capable to take advantage of increased bandwidth, otherwise the switched connections will remain at legacy 100 megabit bandwidths."
2,Works for keeping cats out,"I have nosy cats that like to open any cabinet or closet they can get into. I was getting really sick of waking up every night to the sound of the cats opening the bi-fold closet doors in my bedroom and getting into trouble, so I bought two of these locks. They're very simple and do a good job of keeping the cats out. They still try to get in (sometimes I forget to slide them back when I close the doors), but when the doors are locked, they give up pretty quickly. The wands are useless, so I just slide the locks by the lip."
2,Dragons of Winter Night,"I really enjoyed this book. This book had all the makings of Dragons of Autumn Twilight (the book before this one in the chronicles) and more. The reason this book was even better was the characters were not constricted to just one group, they were spread throught the world of Krynn. The group has even greater and more perilous adventures in this book because they are split up and out numbered. In their adventures they meet up in the end and join for the next sequal.You shoud really read this book and enjoy all the wonder of Krynn just a was privaliged to."
1,Everything wrong,"I was sent the wrong ninja costume. Was unable to reach anyone to rectify the problem. The costume says size 8-10, but actually fits a child of about size 5-6. Not well made. Had to sew on the velco on mask and fix a hole in the seam as it is so poorly made. All around bad experience."
2,Great Resource,"As a newly certified wound care specialist nurse I have had a need to build a resource library. Habif's Clnical Dermatology was recommended by my instructors and I am pleased with the quality of both text and photos. The color photos are invaluable, the descriptive text and treatment suggestions are exactly what I was hoping for in a reference format."
2,Excellent DVD - If you can handle the truth about the human body.,"National Geographic - Inside the Living Body is an answer to every day people who are interested in finding out how the body works. The microcosmos of internal organs is revealed in a big view of the human anatomy and function of our daily metabolism. Technologic advances in video recording and computer animation are used in this exceptional DVD to allow us to understand the living body. I recommend it a 100%, you will not be disappointed!"
2,Overall Armageddon is a wonderful movie.,"Armageddon is a great combination of romance, action, human drama, comedy, and a bit of science fiction. It combines an amazing cast with loveable characters, a realistic storyline, and exceptional special effects."
2,A Powerful set of moralistic tales of The Old West,"Out of North Dakota, where the frontier is still a fact of life, rides a storyteller who follows the trail of his neighbor, Louis L'Amour, bringing us a baker's dozen tales of western life without a miss-fire in the bunch. Kent Kamron has explored the hills and plains of the American West and knows well the men who settled there. The cavalryman, cowboy, mail-order bride, homesteader, Sioux warrior and schoolmarm, along with many other characters, inhabit this collection and bring the West to life."
1,This is not sweet at all.,"Sugar Sweet??? This film bored me to sleep. Just happy I did not buy it. The film tries to be sexy tries to be well acted and is neither. Just because it is a lesbian movie, did not make it good, and that is from a lesbian reviewer. Why there are few great lesbian films, I have not a clue. If you need to see a great lesbian film go buy A Family Affair, Lianna, Desert Hearts,Aimee and Jaguar, or even The Killing of Sister George(for old classic film value) ...but forget Sugar sweet...it is sour"
1,Bad service / Bad support,Washington DC and Arlington VA 3G service is spotty at best. Do yourself a favor and stay with Sprint or Verizon. Cingular will also not work in the metro.
2,Visually Stunning,"My granddaughter and I watched this movie together. It is beautifully done, with an appealing cast of characters. I absolutely loved this movie!"
1,MORE LIKE DROOPY EYES,"EVIL EYES is a derivative a la Stephen King/Dean Koontz variety. A failing screenwriter (Adam Baldwin) is approached by a mysterious ""agent"" (Udo Keir) to write the screenplay based on a true story of a screenwriter who went mad and killed his mother, father and wife. As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding. Vague film making at the least."
1,CheckSoft,Product not enough retail sales compatable. Does not give ability to create deductions. Just too general. Don't like check design feature.
2,Down Syndrome,"Excellent album. It's insane, intense and instantly likeable. Yes, it has some intentional funny moments and some politics but so did Frank Zappa. If Zappa had done some heavy rock-this would be it. Though it's extreme it's also catchy. Recommended higly."
1,He's Craaaaazy!,"Kevin Trudeau's Weight Loss Cure is great bathroom-reading material. I found it to be an easy read, but would not personally subscribe to the ""cure"", which I consider to be such drastic measures."
1,Region 2,"The Connie and Carla DVD is a region 2, a video intended to be played on DVD players in Europe, something I didn't know. I would like to return it because it doesn't work on my player or most players in the USA. The region 2 category should have been more clearly explained. Why sell it in the US when it won't work? I tried to contact the sellers but got no response.Tracy Bouvier"
1,Drawing the Mists,"This movie was absolutely the antithesis of everything Bradley wrote in her novel. None of the characters were portrayed accurately and none of the events matched completely with those in the book. Haphazard, the movie is more confusing than ever the closer it comes the the end. Everything become Christian and that is not what happens. Read the book - avoid the movie."
2,Better than regular chips,I like these so much better than the Original (red can) chips. They are lighter and crisper and less salty. I eat them because of the taste not because of the reduced fat. I will order a case when they get them back in stock!
1,I can't give her just one star because I love her so much,"I love Anne Rice, I mean LOVE her stories! However, this one was well....bad. Actually, it put me to sleep (and I am an insomniac). I couldn't find any story in it. It was pretty words but no depth. It was telling us something we already know. The worst part was being too long winded. I know, she is long winded anyway, but it usually pays off. This one didn't. I read Memnoch and was disappointed there too (though not as bad as Pandora) and Violin was awful. Please please please, Ms. Rice....write like you used to! Your books (the old ones) are what made me want to be a writer! Please!"
2,Worked ok but ended up removing it,"If you have ever masked something to be painted then you know how accurate you have to be when lining up the edges. The same thing applies with this stuff. Sure you can overlap and then exacto/razor it off but then you create waste. This stuff works pretty good but it doesnt like corners. The key is not to stretch the tape, if you do then it will pull off after a little bit. It stuck really well through a heavy rain storm right after application. I didnt like how I had to put multiple pieces on for a corner and seeing edges really bothered me. Going to try plastidip next time."
2,one person's guide,"This book is, as the title says, one person's perspective. It has lots of useful suggestions for coping. It helped me by being an example of someone who suffered like i have. The part that disappointed me was that the author insisted that people trying to commit suicide dont really want to die. instead she says they are making gestures to call attention to themselves. Though this can be the case many times, other people are very private about their attempts and serious about dying. This technicality did not take away from the usefulness of her suggestions though."
2,"Britian's answer to ""BOB Books""!","""Have a go"" is number 2b in a series (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.) which takes beginning readers slowly through the process of learning several new words in the context of everyday adventures. The stories are interesting, based on stories young kids can identify with, and beautifully illustrated. We've found the pace to be perfect -enough to keep a child interested, but not overwhelmed! They are not as silly as the Bob Book series, but seem a little more ""grownup"".I found this book and a few others in the ""Key Word Reading Scheme"" set in Toronto three years ago. My daughter is now starting to read and I'm very glad to have this book and the others in the series. For some reason they are almost impossible to find in the U.S., while other Ladybird Book series are available. We've loved all of them! Maybe Amazon could find a way to make the whole set available?"
2,I only wish there were more...,"Shame on A&E; for canceling this excellent series! With the talent of Hutton, Chaylkin and the revolving set of strong character actors this was one of the best shows on television. Although the core characters (Wolfe, Goodwin, Fritz, Kramer, etc...) were consistently played by the same actors, the varying supporting characters were played by a revolving cast of actors. This meant that the client of one episode might be the villain in the next. Although some have complained that this was confusing, I think that it was an original idea that worked quite well. In fact, it reminded me of an acting troupe that would change roles for each stage play.IF you are a fan of the original Rex Stout novels, you will love these shows. The characters, dialogue, and general feel of the series is faithful to the original stories. Conversely, if you enjoy the show you will enjoy the books which are very similar."
1,Sugar,"If you hate country music, you will love this album. Rascal Flatts are everything that is wrong with country music today. ""Me and My Gang"" is the furthest thing from a country song I have ever heard, yet country radio laps it up, and lets legends like Merle Haggard and George Jones lay in the ditch.My advice is don't buy this garbage if you enjoy country music. It will only make you mad."
2,DBZ Budokai 2 is da bomb!!!!,"Dragonball Z budokai2 is awesome. They have way better moves, fusions, potara, and characters. You can now get Majin Buu Super Buu and Kid Buu. It is AWESOME game and u should get it!"
2,Interesting but not her best work,"I have read ALL of Alice Hoffman's books and was very excited when this one came out. I have to admit though, I am a little disappointed. I am about half-way through the book and finding it not a compelling read (I keep hoping I'll get hooked)HOWEVER, I would urge any reader - whether you are loving this book, or hating it - read her other work, ESPECIALLY ""TURTLE MOON"". That was my introduction to Hoffman and really blew me away. Don't give up on Alice, every book can't ""hit a home run""."
2,GREAT FIT!,"Uni has awesome fits, I bought both a hat and a Jealous top. Its comfy, they look great with jeans. It gives you the look of being stylish, but yet casual."
2,Great Information,"This book is a must read for women and men alike. Very well written, easy to understand, and a ton of information. Also, the rules apply to people of all economic backgrounds. Very useful!"
1,color washed off,"Color washed off within one month of use and its a little too bulky for a newborn. Recommend trying ""Baby Buddy Bear Pacifier Holder"" Love them."
2,My shaver works so much better.,I get a faster closer shave with the new razor replacemnt heads. Get some.
2,Very satisfied,"The headset was exactly what I expected after reading previous reviews. The material is very thin and light - not something I would want to travel with. I have a large head, and the fit is very comfortable - very light on the ears. The sound is good, although I don't listen to quality music with them. The mike is two-way adjustable. Overall, I'm very satisfied."
1,Not for Grownups!!,"Im a 20 year old male who thought roller coaster tycoon was awsome so when i recieved ps2 this was the first game I bought. To even put the two im the same sentence is ridiculous. The ps2 version is looney and requires no actual creativity and skill. The rides are all predone for you and building a roller coaster is childs play. Although my 5, 8, and 9 year old brothers do enjoy it even though the all prefer tycoon also."
2,A reader,An excellent concise review of material learned through a whole semester. I used it as my primary source in preparing for the CLEP in American Government. I passed the exam with ease. (I also used the Complete Idiot's Guide to American Goverment as a secondary source)
1,HEEEEEEEEEEEY,"What is going on here!! I just took 2 scoops and I'm falling asleep. I know people develop a tolerance, but this is ridiculous. I'm wondering if there is any trace of superpump I used to take in this product I got. Is this a new formula or did somebody sell me trash? Remember the stomach problems? Nope, not there any more. Not that I miss them, but to me it is just an additional proof that something major has changed I just don't know what it is. I will not buy this product again, beware of the seller!!!"
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,I live in Oregon. I bought this set and could not play the DVD. It will not play on the DVD player or on the computer and we even changed regions. I love James Blunt and have his CD (the CD in this set is great too after you get used to it being live) but I found the DVD impossible to play. I paid for something I can't even use!
2,"Slight as a Summer breeze, and just as pleasant","Summer Things/Embrassez Quiz Vous Voudrez is one of those films that probably shouldn't really work but does. Based on a British novel by Joseph Connolly following various middle class characters (upwardly and downwardly mobile) on a holiday that takes in various affairs, jealousies and suicide attempts, it's a light confection that works surprisingly well, not least because people DON'T do the right thing (when estate agent Jacques Dutronc finds out an employee has reduced the price on a desperately short of cash friend's house for a backhander, he does nothing to rectify the situation). Much of what happens is fairly predictable, with the exception of Charlotte Rampling keeping her clothes on for once, but the performances are strong and Michel Blanc's direction keeps it all on track. Nothing profound, but surprisingly likeable.Extras are fairly light - just a trailer and a photo montage with an audio essay by the director."
2,Detective Barbie at the Carnival,"I found this game a bit too hard or a glitch in there.After looking for Ken and the clues seemed futile, my daughter and I really enjoyed the rides.We quit worrying about find Ken and figured he left the park, so we went on the rides.It is fun, but a few minutes of rides and we were ready to leave the park."
1,Missing an Essential Defense,"One thing that is blantantly missing in this book is a logical defense of its premise. If the Bible is sufficient for all Christian doctrine, then where in the Bible is the canon of Scripture defined, and where in the Bible is Sola Scriture defined. I can't find it in this book. But we do find it in Protestant traditions. While we're at it, I guess the Holy Spirit got it wrong on the Old Testament canon but right on the NT canon? How can that be?"
1,Surface Noise!!!!!!,"Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!"
2,Excellent,"No ads. Large print. Beautiful illustrations. Interesting age appropriate stories. Every magazine by this publisher (Cricket, etc) are all quality magazines that are child centered.My daughter is five. I think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads' it cover to cover. She also enjoys looking at the pictures as well.This is worth every penny."
2,Move Closer,"Too bad for a majority of the population of the United States that this song is not available. Why must America be stuck with the top 40s from the 70s and 80s when music like this is available? It is clearly the best thing on the airwaves, albeit the internet. The only way the yanks will hear it is by listening to Heart 106.2 from London after 10:00 PM Central. Stunning vocals and music. This is a must have! What a pity......."
1,not what was promised,"This connector is sold as if it's at least equivalent to the Apple original equipment. However, if I use the phone when it's plugged in, it behaves oddly, doesn't respond appropriately, sometimes won't perform at all. The connector does recharge the phone, but it certainly doesn't have full functionality."
1,A Poor Product!! Not Worth The Money!! Don't Buy!!,"I am embarassed to say that I have purcased 3 Litter Maid Mega 900 Models and every single one died and untimely death right after the warranty period had expired. I liked the idea of the Litter Maid even though there were some ""issues"" with it. Like clumping of poo on the rake that would cause it to go over and over again. Cleaning the unit was a nightmare! I must say though I will not be buying a 4th one after the failure of the 3rd one I feel like the biggest fool in the world! Whats the old saying Fool me twice shame on me! Well after 3 SHAME ON ME! I wonder how many of these are clogging up landfills across the country?? I won't be buying a 4th one!"
1,Waste of Money,"This book is a waste of money - I bought it thinking I was going to learn something new - the BIG revelation -Woman want to be treated as people - there I told you - so don't waste your time or your money....Mary Lou Quilan states the obvious again and again, it is not worth the [$$$]."
