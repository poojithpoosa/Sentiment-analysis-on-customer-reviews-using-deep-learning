2,Armageddon,"Armageddon: A Novel of BerlinOne of the most eye opening novels I have ever read about the Russian/Allied ""war"" over the Berlin 4-zones occupation situation. Hard to put down."
1,"not ""cables to go"" brand name. Buyer beware!","these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff. although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long. As the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" but this is nothing less than false advertising."
1,Easily chewed up,"I bought the medium for my Staffordshire terrier to ""mix it up"" with her toys when she is crated. Within a few hours she had gnawed enough off of it that pieces of rubber were coming out and I had to take it away for her own safety. The flying saucer shape is really interesting and moves/rolls in fun ways, but the durability is definitely lacking. However, I have also purchased the Busy Buddy squirrel and the ""Waggle"" bone and those two items, even though they are the same brand, have held up fine!"
1,Not performed by Burt Bacharach!,"Unfortunately I purchased this album believing that it was performed by Burt Bacharach. And not. I suggest to advert more clearly to the customers of it, to avoid dissatisfaction."
1,A total scam!,"The 2 VHS tapes that make up SHOWBOAT COMPOSER: JEROME KERN are nothing more than a bad VHS reproduction of the 1946 MGM musical biopic TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY. Of course, they don't tell you this anywhere in the advertising of the product, so what you think you're getting is some kind of documentary about the life and work of composer Jerome Kern. You can buy a re-mastered DVD of TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY on Amazon for $2.55.Till the Clouds Roll By (Remastered Edition)If you want to see this movie, which is quite splendid, buy that and not this worthless piece of junk, which cost $10."
1,"SO BAD IT'S....WELL, BAD",Anyone who gave this piece of tripe more than one star should not be allowed to vote (or raise children).
1,Incomplete info,"The size of the product was not displayed on your page. While searching for this product on Google the size was shown as 22"" long ans I was sent to your site to purchase. I placed the order and received the product today. Opened the box and to my surprise it was only 19"" long instead of 22""."
1,"NEVER BUY USED , FROM duker8888 !!","I GOT A NINTENDO CONSOLE 64,THAT DOES NOT WORK, DIRTY WITH ONE CONTRLLLER ONLY ??, NO INVOICE TO FILE A CLAIM.CARLOS VELARDEGLENDALE,CA. 91206"
1,More Instrumental Please!,"I love movie soundracks. They comprise at least 10% of my personal music.The intro by Linkin Park and the 4th track by Rob Dougan are excellent and powerful.However, I won't buy this soundtrack. It will be another example I'll use in my ongoing quest to ""voice"" my preference for instrumental music.I intensely dislike these particular Marilyn Manson & Rob Zombie tracks for their use of language and tone of voice, though I have enjoyed both artists work in the past. Granted there are other singers with talent on the disk, but the overall effect shows that more and more often, music is being cranked out simply to meet expectations of production/merchandising with only a fleeting glace at quality.I admit I'm impressed that we could get two CDs for the price of one, but again its quantiy over quality in order to sell.Thanks anyway."
2,Brutal but Honest Portrayal,"This book does not pull any punches about prison life. Advice is freely given and some of it may be disturbing. For example, the authors clearly state that you WILL have to fight in order to survive behind bars. If for no reason other than to show others that you cannot be ""turned out"" or be made a victim. As an attorney who has toiled in the criminal justice system (both as a defense atty and as a prosecutor), I was moved by the book's honesty, compassion, and accounts of prison life. There are sections dealing with corrupt guards, gangs, drugs, sex, money, etc. Nothing is left out. This book should be required reading for all those who advocate ""tough on crime"" as this read clearly demostrates that prison is a brutal and unforgiving experience."
1,Should have read reviews,"I always read reviews, but didn't think it necessary for such a minor purchase. I should have...it shrunk! Not just a little either...it's not useable."
1,"Buy ""Two Towers"" instead!","This is a very mediocre game based on the book. You will probably enjoy reading the book much more than playing this game. If you want a ""Lord of the Rings"" game, I highly recommend ""The Two Towers"" which is much better."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR A LITTLE FAN,"Having read every Bentley Little book, including Death Instinct, I can honestly and regretfully say that this is his worst book. After the first hundred or so pages, I could tell that Bentley had lost his inspiration .... Ridiculous scenes involving dancing pottery killed any horror or suspense that could have built from this complete mess of a story that dragged on and on. I love this author, don't get me wrong, but this is one to skip. I recommend The Ignored, The Mailman, and The Association."
2,The game,"While a very fun game it is a bit repeatative, and hard right off the bat. I just got a x box 360 so I haven't really played much of this game"
1,CHEAP CONSTRUCTION!,"I recently was given this toy by my mother. After reading the directions I spent over an hour trying to assemble this toy. The key word there was TRYING. NO I never finished assembling the toy. Most if not all of the pieces that were supposed to snap into place were not aligned with the correct holes. And the reason I didn't finished assembling it was because the top of it which is supposed to ""snap"" on like the directions say, bent. The more I tried to straighten it out the more it bent. In the end I had to return it. I would definitely highly recommend NOT buying this toy. It's more trouble then it's worth."
2,review,"This product was as described, purchased for my 18 mo old grandson. The animals are small enough for him to hold in 1 hand. He and his brother had fun trying to hit the ""basket"". Would recomend to a friend."
2,its cool....but not that cool,alright....heres the low down... this game was awesome for about....hmmmm lets see.....2 months or so. It gets old pretty fast so if your interested in buying i would suggest that you rent it from a local video store before...see how you like it. if you love it...buy it. if you like it a lot but dont want to spend the money...maybe one of your friends has it. enjoy to the people who get it. its really fun. but beware for the future
2,Good Stuff...,"This is the good stuff. Even my grandma would be shakin' to this first wave skankin' reggae. For the Brits out there, it's worth the price for ""Soul Limbo"" alone, which you will fondly recognise as the raw and vibed-up original of the BBC's cricket music. Absolutely inspirational! If you've come so far as to read this, don't hesitate to buy. This music willl make you happy."
1,Poor to say the least,"Nothing scientific about it...poor, conjecture and as usual no evidence,,a lot of silly not worth while to buy, I like my money back"
1,Unreadable,"Reading this book is almost impossible. It is poorly written, and mostly boring. In some parts, the ones in which the author attempts to explain how Geller supposedly cheated on some of his scientific test, the book reads like a Tom Clancy novel - without the suspense. Mr Randi explains in depth the high-tech electronic devices which could have been invented to help Mr. Geller. Yes, Mr. Randi, and the CIA is using your neighbor's satellite dish to read your thoughts..."
1,Completely ignored.,"You never know with cats, I guess. But my two rambunctious kittens, who usually loves toys, didn't even look at this. They simply sniffed it and walked away. Even when I started the rocking motion myself, they just ignored it. They did like the box it came in, naturally. I gave this two stars only because it seems to be well-made, sturdy wood contruction like the peekaboo toy box made by the same company, which the cats do love."
1,Fraud,"To any true Sinatra fan, this collection represents some of his weaker stuff. The claim that it is ""Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits"" is totally fraudulent."
2,A lot of nostalgia at a great price!,"I won't review the movies, because chances are if you are looking at this, you've already seen them.The special effects have long since been the spectacle they were when the movies were released, but that doesn't stop the power of the story of a boy looking for an escape from his everyday problems. Imaginative, uplifting and fun it's quite the bargain.The second movie doesn't quite have the power of the first, but if nothing else it is enjoyable to visit new locations in Fantasia and meet new characters."
1,Overpriced,"I have a friend that uses these cables with his X-Box and HDTV. Being curious as to if they provide any improvement, I took my MS HD cables over to his house and we compared them with his Monster. We saw very little difference with the two sets."
2,Works well - simple,"Works well. It's really a simple chair that allows a baby to sit up in a batch. Your baby needs to be comfortable sitting up for this - if she/he is, it should work well."
1,Enjoy Directv Tivo on good old black and white...,"Buyer Beware. The N750 will not record off the Directv Tivo hard drive in color. Why? Who knows. Certainly not Sony, who denies a problem exists, despite post after post from affected owners of the N750 and N700 on various websites (eg, Tivo community) that all complain of the identical issue. Even after I proved I could record in color using a borrowed 8yr old Zenith VCR and the identical cables/hook-up and tape, Sony refuses to acknowledge a compatability issue with Tivo. They did make me the generous offer of shipping me an identical, ""refurbished"" model for $45-$80 dollars (depending on warranty status)...that also won't work. If you enjoy color, and you own a Directv Tivo, buy another brand! If you want to spend quality time with Sony's head in the sand, technical support gurus, then the N750 is the unit for you."
2,Helped Me Get Rid of Back Pain - Permanently,"I bought this book while I was on my way towards improving my lower back pain. At that time I was exercising hard, I had already lost a good amount of body fat, but the pain kept coming back every once in a while. All I did was introduce some of the anti-inflammatory foods in my diet, reduce or eliminate the oness that were highly inflammatory, and in a matter of months, the pain was gone. I'd say it's a pretty good result after over 20 years of pain. Now I can work out hard, play tennis, table tennis, do high intensity interval training, without any pain whatsoever. Just to make one thing clear - I don't see this book as a guide to a diet that you can go on and once you're done you go back to eating the stuff that's bad for you. The way I see it, the food choices, recipes and resources from the Inflammation Free Diet Book are meant to help you make long-term diet changes that will significantly improve the quality of the rest of your life."
2,Led Zeppelin's Best Album Ever,"IV is the best Led Zeppelin album ever to come out. All of the songs are still played on classic-rock radio today, so discussing what one is the best is really pointless. You've got your pure-blood rockers (""Black Dog"", ""Rock & Roll"", ""Misty Mountain Hop""); cautionary anthems (""Stairway To Heaven"", ""When The Levee Breaks""); acoustic ballads (""The Battle Of Evermore"", ""Goin' To California""),and the unusual ""Four Sticks."" Some people like to listen to this one really loud, but its uniqueness can only be truly appreciated at a low-to-moderate volume."
2,I couldn't put it down - this is a first- rate thriller!,This sequel to The Plague Tales is as much of a good read as was its' predecessor! While I wish it had been a bit more uplifting it was true to the realities of it's times. The uncertain ending leaves things open for a third book that could perhaps follow the lives of the new members of Janie's and Alejandros' families! I look forward to another sequel. Keep up the good work.
1,An absolute piece of junk. Don't WASTE your money!!!!,"This has got to be the worst chain I have ever purchased. Wal-mart sells more durable chains than this. Shimano should be ashamed of themsleves. I'd never put this on any bike, even if it was gifted to me.First time, it worked for about 25 miles and broke. Second time, worked for about 50 miles and then broke. I decided not to put it back on my bike. Grabbed an ""emergency"" chain off an old wal-mart bike and have been riding without any problems since. Considering the bike came out of the trash.... well, you get my point.Don't think that your going to get away with a good HG53 chain. This chain is nothing but junk. Don't waste your time or money on this. Steer away. Don't make me tell you that ""I told you so"". If you want a entry level chain, go to wal-mart and buy the ""bell"" brand for around $8, it will last much longer!!!If you want quality then you must go ultegra, dura ace, xtr, or Sram."
1,Very Unsatisfied,Was not impressed with the pan at all-it is not a 12 inch but only 11 1/4 - the quality isn't worth the money-sent mine back and order the mill.farberware 12 inch that I had before.
1,this sucked,boring and annoying :( bummer because I love Ben A. Do not rent this movie. It is a Christmas waste of time.
2,Great product,A sequel to Pillar of Fire which is a historical fiction book set in about 600 BC in Jerusalem. My son and I are enjoying this book. The characters and plot are exciting and it includes explanations of the customs of the time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of that time
2,A side of Kerouac you seldom see,"Everyone knows of Kerouac's famous road trips, hitchhiking or riding the rails. And Lowell, Mass. is famous as his hometown. But few think of Kerouac's time spent in Florida, which was actually where he found fame on the publishing of On the Road and where he wrote, among others, the stellar Dharma Bums.Kealing depicts Kerouac's life in Florida in a starkly honest way, sprinkling interviews with neighbors and friends along with the story of the last 10 years of Kerouac's life. You get a sense of Kerouac's mad love of nature and his family as well as the depression that drove him to drink himself to death. It's a very moving account of the life of an often-misunderstood literary genius."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I loved The Baker's Boy series. I bought this one, hoping that it would be the same. Instead, I found myself giving up half-way through. I might pick this up again and finish it, but I stopped caring about the characters. And the previous lip-chewing comment was right. It became a real distraction to me. Too bad, I really wanted to like this."
1,I tried to keep reading ...,"I finally stopped around p80. There was no character development of the two sisters (beyond one is pretty, the other smart) - at least by p80 and the knight just spent 80 pages trying to decide which sister (or servant) to sleep with - he still had not decided when I decided to close the book for good. This testosterone driven knight was not interesting enough for me to keep going. Jennifer Blake's ""Louisiana Dawn"" or Lisa Kleypas' ""Then Came You"" or Joanna Lindsey's ""Captive of My Desires"" were so much better."
1,Huge waste of $$$$$$,"I wanted a safe alternative to the shock collar. this certainly was not it!!! I have an older Dachie mix rescue dog. He hates cats (which I own 2) I'm trying to break him of this habit of barking and going after them. The problem with the collar is that it sprays him with every little sound he makes. He makes some deep sounds (not barking or growling) more like ""talking"". so between those sounds and the barking, the collar continuously sprays him. He also figured out if he turns his head, he doesnt get sprayed. At least with a shock collar it differentiates between just sound and barking. the worst part....this collar can not be returned. So now I'm out over $35.00 for something that I cant even use.do not recommend this at all."
1,What a horrible book!!!,"This subject had such promise! Unfortunately the author turned it into a Harlequin Romance bodice ripper novel about exploited, misunderstood white women who could only find understanding by ""volunteering"" to become the wives of a Native American chief who was hoping to broker a cross cultural understanding by ""marrying"" his family to white women.He perpetuates every stereotype of native americans and the sexual motives of women that have come down through time. Shame on you!! This could have been a fantastic historical novel. I am sorely disappointed!! You have done a disservice to everyone involved."
2,Perfect just like I heard,You can never go wrong with a Mario game. Playing it on Wii is just all the better. I love how you can get so much more involved in the game.
1,I second the last comment,I knew it was too good to be true but these false sellers are taking up space on this website.
2,Become a better baker with this book,"This is one of the most frequently used cookbooks in my kitchen. The recipes are easy to understand and although laborious at times, the effort is often worth it. I feel that this book has helped me improve my cooking/baking skills tremendously. I would suggest the recipient of this book obtain a heavy duty mixer, since many of the recipes require its use. Julia and her co-author conspirators display a helpful humor, advising the consulting cook not to worry when things look like they shouldn't. I highly recommend this book and have purchased it as a gift for several friends. The beautiful pictures are a great inspiration, as well."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book offers a clever title . . . and little else.This book contains very little practical advice about multi-dog households. The majority of the book is general dog info (i.e. first aid, medical care, feeding). Beyond that, the author spends far too much time gushing over her own pack of German Shepherds. For me, this was irrelevant and not applicable at all to my own situation."
2,One question...,"Why did Moira O'Hara age after her death? None of the other characters aged. And she became two characters of different age while other characters stayed at the age and level of maturity they were when they died.And everybody else kept their death wounds. Young Moira was shot through the right eye. Old Moira had that bum eye, but young Moira had both eyes.This is Really Important. Or not."
1,Not a great bike,"I was distracted by the brand name of this bike, but in actuality it was not a great purchase. The quality was just not great and it was quite heavy. I think Kettler do better with their trikes and scooters."
2,A good read -- but where is the rest of it?,This is by far the best of Parker's non-Spenser novels. I enjoyed reading it tremendously. It is too bad Parker hasn't seen fit to follow it up with sequels. This book doesn't deserve the obscurity it has been forced to endure.
2,All of the Curwood books are forgotten classics,A Mountie from his deathbed confesses to a crime in order to protect the actual killer -- then recovers & must face the possibility he may hang. The resulting struggle for life & honor provides one of the great classic adventures of the Royal Mounted Police in the Canadian Northwest & the far-frozen North
1,Not great...,"I bought this cable so that I could play video games on my computer using my monitor as a TV. I know it's possible, because my oldest brother has the exact same cable and did the same thing. After installing everything, it didn't work. I then uninstalled everything, reinstalled it, and now my computer won't recognize the cable at all. Either I didn't uninstall it ""properly,"" or my cable went bad."
2,Wonderful music cd for Chanukah,"Wonderful selection of chanukah music including traditional melodies, new arrangements and original pieces. This CD is sure to become a holiday classic."
2,Good Fun Game.,"This game is great it's sort of challenging at the start whenyou have to collect pieces of the solar surfer but I found out asecret:AT THE START SCREEN,SELECT CONTINUE AND WHEN IT ASKS FORA PASSWORD,TYPE APRON TO SKIP TO CRESENTIA SPACEPORT."
1,Sardines for sale,"I like spicy food and I like sardines, but I don't like these. I simply cannot finish my pack of 10 cans. I like other Vigo sardines and I wouldn't say these are low quality, but something about the mixture of these strong flavors doesn't work for me. I can taste them for hours."
2,It works!,"Slimmer belt actually works! It definitely makes you sweat and is comfortable. Lost 5 inches off of my waist since my purchase 7 weeks ago. Probably could have lost more but this is without a diet. I am up to the 2nd zipper and yes its a great perk. Down side is it could have been a little longer, especially for those who are looking to lose back handles or baby flaps from c-sections otherwise, you'll need to adjust it up and down. The zippers could be a little less bulky as well for women who like to wear fitted blouses, but overall it does not show much thru your clothes. I recommend for back support and working out. I was pleasantly surprised!"
2,Where is the Widescreen Blu Ray?,"Ok, I love this movie.. The only problem is this. Where is the Widescreen Blu Ray Release? The studio needs to get in gear and release this!!"
1,Not what was paid for,"I loved the one glove I got - it was supposed to be a pack of 6 that my sister got me for my birthday - however, it turned out to be just one glove. While I wasn't initially disappointed, because I didn't know it was supposed to be 6 gloves, when I found out that I could have had a pink one, 2 in fact, and 3 more white ones, I thought that was a little WRONG. My sister, who lives several hundred miles away, was also quite upset, & I'm hoping by now that she got her money back!"
1,I hate it,"I was truly looking forward to this product and was extremely dissapointed. The inside diameter is too small and this info is not provided. I own a Fuji road bike. I was going to buy another product until I realized it was manufactured by the same company. Again, no info on the diameter is provided. You just lost a customer."
1,An overly scholastic look at an interesting document,The concept of this book was admirable and the text of the encyclical is intriguing but a lot of the narrative is dull and repetitive. Its a good piece of information that could have been presented in a more readable manner.
2,Its worth every penny!,"Well its cute, dosent take up too much space, and my baby loves it at 6mnths. My son loves it when i put it on his tray he plays on it i only see him sitting up playing with it later, its a great buy, and not too expensive!Oh p.s. they dont say this but you should really watch your kid and not let them fall asleep on this it is plastic and could form to the shape of their face i do not reccomend leaving a sleeping baby on it or near it, just saying not a water bed. I have a friend..... I know some people...."
1,Not what I thought I was buying,"I was looking for wooden puzzles like Melissa and Doug puzzles that are nice and stable. These puzzle pieces are flimsy and everytime my son lays a piece, the whole puzzle breaks apart. Wish the pieces were a little bigger or more heavier so the other pieces wouldn't fall apart."
1,Carnosaur 4,"If you've seen the first three Carnosaur movies, you've seen this one. They take footage from the first three and add a little bit. The first three movies were cheesy fun, this one was just...no."
2,Great Game!!!!!,"This is a Wonderful game. not only is it fun, but you can learn a lot. I have also found that even a couple of my friends who are slightly younger than me have fun too. My parents like it too. So basically, it has levels of hardness for everyone but can go light on the smaller kids. My only concern is that in the future, me and my friends will run out of cards and get sick of the game. Overall, the game is a blast to play."
2,The Arctic Incident,"The Arctic Incident was a fantastic book. It was filled with love and determination. In the begginning Artemis Fowl recieves an email that says his father was alive and that he was being held for ransom. Artemis's dad had supposedly died when his boat crashed. Before Artemis can leave to save his father he was captured by a fairy. The year before Artemis had stolen 15 million dollars worth of gold from the fairies. Artemis ended up helping the fairies. He did this so the fairies would help him save his father. Find out of Artemis can save his father, read Artemis Fowl The Arctic Adventure!"
1,TRASH!!!!,"You get what you pay for, thought I was saving money but still getting a compatible phone for my Vonage system.. it was compatible it just didn't work..Phones would not charge and base would not boot up. several calls later with Vonage I found out these are discontinued old models.. don't waste you money or time. I did it for you."
2,very nice,"I haven't seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here, although 12 boxes is a lot. They're great with butter and honey. Haven't tried them with anything else.They're very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out. But they still have a healthy taste."
2,When the Levees Broke,This is a superbly done piece on Hurricane Katrina. My hat is off to Spike Lee.
1,Just awful,"My ten year old daughter thought this film was ""kind of stupid."" When I asked her what was wrong with it, she hesitated about 2 seconds and said ""It needed a plot."" If a normal ten year old can determine in 2 seconds what is wrong with this movie, why can't a studio with access to million dollar talent?This movie was particularly disappointing in comparison to the first film, which my daughter (and I) found fun and worth many reruns."
1,High price - short life - poor value.,High price for a heating pad that lasted 18 months.The thermostat would fluctuate temperature between cold and very hot even when new.One day it just stopped - digital display still worked but no heat.
1,innaproprite/bad choice toy for a child,"This is clearly a bad choice toy to give a child.Faults: inspires plain/flat out gothic behavior, inspires evil, dark/scary looking features, slutty, innapropriate.Never in my life would i let a child play this toy."
2,Great Christmas read.,"The description inside talks about pictures. There was only text, no pictures in the Kindle version. Drawings would have been nice."
1,Overrated,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units, and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me, especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all, so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options, and if they weren't on sale, it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries, I cant get the things out."
2,Delius' Champion,"British composer Frederick Delius basically owes his legacy to conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In fact my introduction to Delius came via Beecham's disc in EMI's ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series. This Sony import title captures TB in mono performances from 1950-55 of Delius works not included in that aforementioned EMI CD. Here he leads his Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the fantasy overture ""Over the Hills and Far Away,"" ""Sea Drift"" for baritone, chorus and orchestra, featuring text by Walt Whitman, and ""Paris (The Song of a Great City)."" Many classical music devotees dismiss Delius as a lightweight, but I find this music to be compelling if not absolutely essential. In all, another fine Beecham reissue from Sony UK."
2,Kevin Smith's brilliant stab at a romance movie,"Chasing Amy is a 90s love romance in the eyes of Kevin Smith. Only he could com up w/a plot so hilarious and clever. The story is about this guy Holden (Ben Affleck), and his friend Banky who create comic books together. Holden falls in love w/ a girl, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), but there's one problem... she's a lesbian. So throughout the entire movie, Holden tries to win her over, despite the jealously/resentment of his best friend, her wild sex life of her past, and any other unpredictable things that come his way. The cameo by Jay & Silent Bob, a regular in all of Kevin Smith's movies, gave the film a humorous break from the romantic drama in the movie. It's a must see movie."
2,HE's BACK!,"It's been almost 2 years since the last release from Prince. He's back with a message in a totally different direction from his previous works. That's a good thing. Good jazz incorperated rock fusion CD. Reminds me of early Santana, Miles in the early 70's with a few touches of the neo-soul movement. Two things should have been eliminated to push this to a five star review... The slowed down narration voice almost at every break between songs, and that silly ""Wedding Feast"" snippet about food. Otherwise it's a pretty decent direction where Prince is taking his music now."
1,Read the Reviews!!!!,"I usually read the reviews before making a purchase and for some reason I didn't on this one. Don't waste your money!!! The plastic cups are the worst. Egg yellows were solid and whites were not cooked, alot of water build up."
1,Kindle Joy,I love everything about my Kindle 2. I read a lot and I'm only concerned about storage and the fact that I can't erase what I've read. It's the perfect size to take anywhere...and I do!!!
2,Storage Rack,The storage rack was smaller than I expected but very sturdy and ended up being the right size for the space I placed it in. It is very easy to put together. One person can do it and no tools needed. It is a great item and would buy it again if I need another one.
1,Videotape is Censored - Get DVD,".The Sorority Boys videotape I rented at Hollywood Video was censored.A notice at the beginning said it was edited to fit the tv screen AND for content.I'm going to rent the DVD to see if it is uncensored.Otherwise, it was a funny movie and worth the price."
2,"SMALL roasting pan, but good.","I wanted a pan which would fit in my kitchen sink, so that it would be easy to clean and I would be thus more likely to use it. Well, this is the pan. It cleans very easily due to the non-stick coating, and it is definitely broiler-safe, even on the top-rack. It is very small, at only 9x13. But that can be a benefit for couples or small families.Now all that's left is to see how it holds up over time..."
2,Great sock substitute!,I've used these off and on for years and just found them on Amazon's website. These are used in place of socks. I really like them. You cut them to size. The instructions say to handwash but I've put mine in the washing machine and let them air dry. The terrycloth feels good and keeps your shoes from smelling. I highly recommend these.
2,More evidence that 4AD was brilliant...,"This was the template for an entire era of production using samples and processors. As a youngster who bought this 12"" in 1986-87, I found it to open up an entire world of soundscapes and production concepts.What I liked even more than PUTV was the little treasure hidden as the B-Side called ""Anitina (First Time I See She Dance)"". This track was a sharp contrast to the bouncy A-Side hit: dark, moody, and dense with distorted guitars, feedback, and real-time delay treatments. The B-side was more in line with the rest of the progressive and experimental 4ad catalog, and likely was under appreciated by the average consumer of this title. For my 7th grade ears, it was a glimpse into a very creative period for European alternative music."
1,NO customer service,My son received this gun for Christmas. All but three darts were ruined by either the loading mechanism or the air pressure during the first day of use(chopped/broken shafts or blown out near the rubber cap). I have emailed BuzzBee on several occasions and had absolutely no response. I would not purchase this or any other BuzzBee product- I will be spending the extra money for higher quality NERF products in the future.
2,excellent!!! ....tips though...,"if you really want to go through all projects, especially the first ones, buy this book first ####Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software###. i find the two to be a great combination. after reading the code book, the first projects on hardware will be to easy. even the rest actually."
1,not worth it,This book was not worth waiting for. I'm returning it for a refund. I will never read any of her work again.
1,Epson CX5400 problems,"I have had an Epson CX5400 for a little over a year and it just died. While it was working it was able to print photos and text at a decent quality, but it was terriblely slow. I called Epson to help troubleshoot my problem and they pretty much told me that the problem was caused by leaving the computer turn on when it was not in use. This was my first time hearing of this causing the problem. I believe I'm going to replace it with something different."
1,hmmmm........,"do you get the impression that all these 5 star reviews are sorta the same? they all say the same-o-same-o. this game sucks cuz the graphics are the worst of any final fantasy game EVER. the hero looks so lame, i wish he had just got blown up or somting. overall a F-."
1,Skip this Printer and do your self a favor!,"DO NOT but this printer.....it ALWAYS needs to have the head cleaning utility used, and doing this, wastes all your ink! At 25+ a pop for ink, it is NOT worth it! You can NOT leave the printer off for a few days, without needing to run the nozzle cleaning util like 3 times, to print something decent!!WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!Do your self a favor, and stay clear of this printer!!"
1,No Stan Bush?? That's lame.,No Stan Bush on this soundtrack? That's about as lame as Bumblebee being a freakin' camaro. This gets a zero.
1,broke first time i tried to use it,"First I discovered that my watch was too thin for the tool to work. There is a screw that moves the platform up and down, but the highest setting was too low. I compensated by putting a piece of cardboard under the watch band and it lined up perfectly. As I tried to remove the pin (and it started to come out), the entire link remover broke in half. This tool was a waste of money!!!!"
2,inexpensive with a really nice sound,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on whatever new guitar I purchased because I was planning on using it for alternate tunings, however after receiving the S34C and doing a little fiddling with it, I was surprised how good it sounded and played. I decided to use my other guitar for the alternate tunings for now. I slotted the bridge to lower the strings into the bridge and made a new bone saddle to replace the plastic one that came with the guitar. This guitar is laminate top to bottom, but really has a nice sound. For under a $100 you can't beat it."
1,Too scary and I'm not a scaredy cat!,"I can't use this thing. Its not easy to use, its loud, and its nearly impossible to see well enough into each follicle, much less hold it there still while you get zapped and it beeps at you. Maybe if someone else was doing it for you...."
1,AVOID at all costs!!!,"If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
1,Krups bombed this time,"We have used Krups products for at least 30 years and have never had an issue with any of them - until now. When we ordered a new coffee maker (coffee and espress side-by-side), it came with this carafe - which lasted about 3 weeks before the plastic thru which a screw attaches the metal ring to the handle/carafe top broke, making the carafe useless as it no longer had either a handle or a cover. We ordered this replacement (I must have been dreaming) thinking maybe we had done something wrong to damage the original. We hadn't. The replacement was as bad as the original, meaning that we have now spent an extra $20.00 replacing a bad product with one just as bad. I do not reccommend this product to anyone and hope the folks at Krups have the sense to improve their quality control before the company's good reputation suffers."
1,Cd Would Have Been Great&#65533;,"Make sure that you check your compilation right when you leave the store. When I purchased this CD after seeing Dio this summer on tour, I opened the CD and there were two of the second discs. Not 1 and 2. Just be careful. Other than that it sounds like a great CD. I like the one I have, but got neglected on some of the earlier Ronnie stuff."
1,Mac Users Avoid This Product!!!!,"I used this printer for quite some time with my Pismo running OS 9.2. When I purchased a Powerbook G4 running OS X, this printer was obsolete, i.e. no drivers available. Sony was absolutely not interested in making a driver for this printer and could not care less about the customer STUCK with this pathetic piece of equipment.If you are a mac user forget it. This printer is not worth a dime. If you already have one, find a PC user to sell it to. Shame on Sony for not working with Apple. If I could give it a rating lower than 1 I would."
2,"Lights Up New Brain Circuits, Opens New Possibilities","""Better Than Perfect"" is better than best. It is stimulating, evocative, and engaging. This ingeniously simple book triggers different insights and outlooks toward our careers, our businesses, and our lives.This book shows you why and how to be one of the indispensible, irreplaceable few who make a business extraordinary. How to think, learn, and communicate differently. With real-world examples, blended into a business fable.I underlined, highlighted, and made notes in the margins of better than 43 pages of this elegantly-written book.I got dozens of jewels out of Dale Dauten's book. But it got even more out of me.""Better than Perfect"" may just be one book you can't stop thinking about.Michael Cloudauthor,""Secrets of Libertarian Persuasion"""
1,Silk purse that's really a pig's ear,"I wrote a favorable review earlier, but that was before I knew (it was recently found in USSR records) that John Reed recieved over 1million from his pals in the bolsheviks/soviet union in the 1910s and 20s.It's not the movie's fault, because the makers had no way to know, that Reed was not so much an idealist who did too much dreaming for everyone's good, as a flat out paid communist agent serving his masters for cash and probably not asking too many hard questions to keep that cash coming in.Everybody admires an idealist (even one who is wrong), but nobody likes a toadie, and this revelation makes the movie, no matter how well done, mortally flawed and a waste of time."
1,(...),"(...) This is the most cheapest product I ever bought, It is so cheap it broke a week after i bought it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Powerful Pop-Rock,"Since the 1970's the Italian musician Renato Zero has been making highly original pop and rock music with meaningful and intelligent lyrics. Zerolandia (1978) is one of his most satisfying albums. The melodic, hook-laden ""La favola mia"" (My Story) open the album on a high note, being one of those poprock powerballads that becomes addictive after the second listen. ""Io uguale io"" (I equals I) is equally catchy, while ""Triangolo"" is a fast number with lovely strings and soaring vocals. ""Sesso o esse"" impresses with its unusual synth effects, while ""Fermati"" is a gentle ballad. ""Amaro Madely"" starts like a radio playing an old song from the 1930's before developing into a dramatic ballad. ""Una guerra senza eroi"" (War without heroes) with its marching beat is another catchy song, and the sax-heavy ""Uomo, no"" concludes his varied and enjoyable album. Zero's great talent lies in his integration of the tension and urgency of rock with the melodicism of the Italian popular song."
2,amazingness,"This machine is by far one of the easiest machines to use. Not to mention that the cleaning is a breeze. I go my closest Bed Bath and Beyond and buy coffee, which they have a great assortment always in stock and the coupons save me money. NO SHIPPING. I would recommend this machine over any regular coffee pot any day of the week."
1,bike basket,This basket it s hard to put up and it keeps on moving....I tried to use it for my little dog and it could not hold him. My dog is only 6 pounds.It's really made with cheap material.:(
2,"Very funny, IF...","...you know a bit about Irish literary history and are willing to put up with a very, um, fractured plot. Unless you know about, for example, the story of the Madness of King Sweeney, the book might not work as well for you. However, my main reason in writing this is to point out something about the editorial review:This book was NOT published a year before Ulysses. That's silly. Ulysses had been published over 20 years previously, I think. Thank you."
2,A Good Dictionary,"Even it's small it's very usefull in a variety of situations, especially on travel, a good summary of high used swedish words."
2,Nice Sound,Nice sound - would have been great if my mobile was capable of syncing to it. Oops did not check a mobile upgrade will solve that ; )
2,Another Great Book,"Another great book from the "" Old Time Preacher."" If you have read his biography then nothing more needs to be said. Get all of his books you can. They are going out of print far too fast. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Vance Havner preached the Gospel, clear and concise and worldly people can't stand it. Hence.... not much demand for his writings."
2,"4 stars, you all just give anybody 5 stars","The Roots are dope everybody knows that. This album is real good in comparision to 90% of hip hop albums but I also think the previous 2 were better. I bought this, Eminem, DJ Quik and Prince Paul the same day. I think this is the second best out of the bunch behind Eminem. That is a hip hop classic. This is close though and mosdef worth your 15 bones or whatever."
1,Save Your Money!,"This CD player is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. It didn't take long for me to find out how badly made it was either. First of all, the radio doesn't pick up radio stations very well. A station that I used to listen to quite clearly on my old $29.99 radio came in very weakly on this one. I've only had the item seven months and the CD player is broken. The antenna always wobbled and looked very cheaply made. As I was adjusting it one day, it bent and then snapped right off!This is the most cheaply made item I've ever bought. I had my old $29.99 radio for over ten years. This item is already falling apart in eight months. Don't buy this item unless you want to waste your money."
2,"Good quality, nice fit","I found that this product runs pretty true to size. Im 6', about 200 pounds and I found that the XXL is a bit too large. I got this since other reviews said that it runs a size small, however, I've yet to wash to see how much shrinkage there will be. T-shirt definitely runs true to size, its so big I use it as a sleep shirt."
2,"Great book, if you can find it","I must have passed this book by many times. When I finally got a copy (back in '91), I was so glad I did. This book focuses on Archers' attack during the opening stages of the battle. The author vividly describes the skirmish that takes place, as well as the impact it had on that day (July 1) and the rest of the battle. While Martin's book ""July 1 1863"" covers this action as well, here in this book a full up review is done. It compare it to Pfanz's detail and Ambrose's readabillity. What ever the avid Gettysburg reader must do to find this book they must."
2,Nickel Creek is NOT bluegrass!!,"Nickel Creek are an acoustic band, not bluegrass. While they do have plenty of bluegrass elements in their music, this is not the genre that they belong to. For those who buy this expecting to hear 'Bela Fleck' or 'Alison Kraus and Union Station', you may be left scratching your head.This album is darn near perfect. I would actually give it a strong 4.5 stars. It's better than ""This Side"", and possibly even better than the debut album, although both of those records are brilliant as well. Nickel Creek are always finding new ways to play their instruments to produce tracks that are built upon the familiar NC sound, yet give it a new twist to make it sound unique. Sarah's voice is angelic; I wish she sang more. Overall just a superb effort, and one that will stay in rotation for quite awhile."
1,"Common Title, Poor Editing","The author has chosen to use his story in book form as a means to provide an outlet for his own therapy (not to mention while getting paid at the same time). I think the book could have been better written -- dialogues and all. A soror sister in the ATL sent me this book and I cannot endorse it to my soro sisters in San Diego. I understand the author wanting to climb the band wagon along with E. Lynn, Marcus Major, Carl Webber, R.M. Johnson, Michael Baisden and such likes, but he has a long way to go. This is one of those stories that nearly every ex-married person can relate. Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about his. My advice to the author and those who suffer heartache and pain: Turn all your cares over to God because he cares for you. You may or may not find temporary relief in white pages and black ink---but you will definitely find permanent relief in Christ Jesus."
2,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Tom Clancy continues to deliver the highest quality of written material
2,Very nice faucet,"I recently remodeled one of my bathrooms and decided to replace the faucet and fixtures with the ones with vibrant brushed bronze from Kohler. As you can see in the sample picture, the faucet looks rather simple. However, its color and appearance definitely added some nice touch to our new bathroom. One downside is its rather high price, but I wouldn't be replacing this one for a long time."
2,What's not to like?,"I'm commenting on the four cuts from '53 -- what a great band and what a happy-sounding Miles! Zoot and Al are always a treat to hear and Cohn's four compositions are ear-catching and memorable. Good, solid swinging stuff recalls a more innocent time. I consider the other tracks a nice extra but I think the disc is worth buying just for the four nicely-arranged Cohn originals."
1,NEVER CAME,"I ordered this product about thw and a half weeks before I needed it for my childrens very first birthday party, I payed to have rush delivery and it never came. It took me like another week to get a refund, and they did not refund the rush delivery money, which was like $15!... I would never order from them again, I am soo upset, because by the time it was actually the day of my childrens birthday we were totally broke and we didnt even have any gold eating coins at their PIRATE party, It totally stinks."
1,"poor quality, danger of shock or electrical fire","The Toastmaster 6431 does not have an Underwriters Lab label, which would make anyone hesitate before buying it. The Underwriters Lab endorsement (a ""UL"" logo) indicates that the electrical product is properly designed and constructed so that it is safe. We found the product online, where there was no info about the UL status of the product.The first thing that broke was the temperature control. We fixed that by oiling the screw whose in-out motion controls the heat setting.The more serious problems emerged when the fuse blew. We looked inside and discovered overheated wires with partially-melted insulation. This condition could cause both an electrical shock to the user and an electrical fire that could burn down a house.Toastmaster makes another hot plate (model TTS1) which does have an Underwriters Lab endorsement. We bought one today, and we hope that it will work safely until after the end of our kitchen remodelling project."
2,Excellent!,"This book is the most in depth Harry Potter I have ever come across, with carefully researched data and rules of thumb that can be used again and again for all the books. Although it does resemble a computer document that hasn't been completely reworked (i.e. emoticons, misspellings) all that is worth it, and makes it more interesting to read. The book takes you through each of the HP series books, keeping up a running commentary and explaining when a key point has been made. At the end of the book, in the ""restricted area"" the authors tie together any loose ends by making preditions about the end of the 5th book and the ultimate end to the series."
1,Not really for a beginner,"I don't consider myself a beginner in that my fitness level is around the average range, I am a little on the uncoordinated side and I couldn't keep up with this. Kathy doesn't slowly walk you through the steps and neither are they simple steps, so if you are looking for something for that is for uncoordinated people like myself, this would not be the video for you."
2,Review for Resume Guidebook purchase,The book arrived in the condition described in a reasonable amount of time. Good purchasing experience.
2,Tremendous Comic Book Movie on BLU-RAY,"I thought that Spider-man 3 was a tremendous comic book movie, Sure there are flaws; to many villians,not very plausible and maybe a bit to sentimental. Who ever stated that comic books are plausible? There is outstanding action all the actors are superb-Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) is a treasure. The special effects are outstanding and most of all the movie has HEART.The BLU-RAY is a state of the art High Defintion presentation with exquisite picture and knock-out PCM sound. This is a must buy, now is the time to enter Blu-Ray High Definition!"
1,I'm an old 3EB fan,"I bought this cd simply because I love Third Eye Blind, and I still do love the band despite this new effort. Listen to it before you buy it, don't buy it on spec like I did. The problem is not that their talent has disappeared, but that it's a flat recording. I don't feel the umph that I require from a song. It sounds like they beat it to death in the recording studio, and lost the emotion of the words somewhere along the way.I was so surprised that I switched players to make sure my speakers weren't screwed up. It wasn't the speakers. In well thought out lyrics and sounds, somewhere it died for me. It seems from the other reviews that many people disagree with me, but my recommendation is to listen to this cd somehow before you purchase it. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should see them live to find their spirit, because I don't think it made it to cd."
2,excellent knife,This is one of the best pocket knives I have. It is excellent quality. I have several pocket knives and this is one of my favorites. Sog has a lot of good knives. I have had a great experience with Sog knives.
1,PURE CRAP!!! WASTE OF TIME!!,"I was so hoping this movie would be worth watching, yet AGAIN I was wrong. The sharks in this movie were a total joke. The so called ACTING was much much worse."
2,Outstanding Book,"I wish there was more publicity on this book. I had watched the show and goggled the show for images and came upon a picture of him before the show and was shocked to see his weight and even more shocked at what he is today. After viewing the sample pages provided by Amazon, I knew I had to grab a copy. I am 10 years older then Frank but he touches the core of my problems. He is an admirable writer that can be respected by all ages. I really appreciate his honesty, sincerity and encouragement. He taps into emotions and experiences that I have yet to see in any book, and for it to target the young generation is phenomenal!! Thanks Frank :)"
2,Taking Chance,AMAZING MOVIE OF A DEDICATED SENIOR OFFICER TAKING INITIATIVE AND CARE OF A SOLDIER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYOME. MUST WATCH!!!!
2,O.K. ish.....could be better,"I really like the bonus disk but why bother with DISK ONE it's just the same old single or album mixes which are available everywhere. DISK 2 has a couple of lost mixes that have not appeared on CD before and that's why I purchased 3 copies....here in Australia it sells for less than $25 Aussie dollars...and since it got yanked in some regions of the world not many copies were pressed so I fugure over time it might become a valuable rareity.....well my great grandchildren might make some money out of their sale one day!!!For Prince's next set of rare releases I hope someone convinces him to release his 12"" remixes of AMERICA which I have only ever found as a 6 min version on CD (Russian Bootleg) although my original 12"" record was much longer (about 20 mins I think).Being a Prince fan I am always willing to make contact with others...if you want you can contact me at tomwynn007 <at> hotmail <.> comKeep those 12"" mixes coming."
2,Much better than I thought it would be.,"Despite it's title (which does the book a huge diservice), this book is a great beginning point for anyone interested in wicca or wondering what the witch in their life is up to. It covers a wide variety of topics with a light touch, but underneath that it's quite serious. I know this gets a lot of flack, at least it does in my local wiccan community, because of the title. Don't let that put you off. It really is quite good and is probably one of the best 101 books I've ever read."
1,The Constant Gardener,"We found this movie too long for the story line. It was a typical who done it. It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying. Overall, boring."
2,Very pleasant,"Good stuff here. The first track is quite famous and rightly so. There are some other standout tracks here and a few that are kind of ho-hum. Nothing's bad, but not everything is classic either."
1,Self-destructed after 1 week; Performance only fair,"Consistent with other reviews on the HDW-2, the plastic ear loop will break no matter how well you care for it. Until Nokia redesigns this part and/or improves customer service, I would strongly recommend against purchasing the HDW-2. Calling Nokia customer service is very frustrating since the consumer pays to return the original defective parts and then must wait for a replacement. Clearly Nokia is unwilling to directly address this problem. Otherwise performance of the HDW-2 is fair. Reception is reasonably good with some intermittent static. Occasionally, the phone and HDW-2 will lose their connection for no apparent reason."
1,A total waste of time,"This assessment was unanimous within my book club. We decided there was a reason this book is out of print, and it should stay that way. We kept waiting for something to happen. Not only were the characters flat, but the whole story really lead nowhere and was unsatisfying."
1,Worst Spongebob & Worst Christmas Show Ever!,"My family all loves Spongebob, but this was the worst Spongebob and worst Christmas show we've ever seen. Not funny, but the look and songs are very irritating, and the songs are most of the show - very little dialog."
1,Best Part,"The best part of this book was the last page, as I knew it was OVER.I have always liked this writer, and her books. We have a 'gaming magazine' here- nothing more- oh- not to forget a murderer who considers shooting over a dozen people near the end.It was wall to wall video games, a murder with a mouse cord, and karate moves, and a buzzard.There were no leaping loons, however-unless you consider the entire cast of this book.If I were a video person, perhaps I would have liked it better. I am happy to say it was a library book~ no money spent here."
2,Sleeping Ugly.,"I liked this book because the prince kissed the right girl.I also liked this book because it had a happy ending. Miserella is very beautiful on the outside, but she's ugly, ugly, ugly on the inside! Plain Jane has a name to fit what she looks like. She has a crooked nose and teeth and her hair is short and messy. But Jane is very kind and beautiful on the inside. Which one do you think the prince chose?This book reminded me os Sleeping Beauty because it was based on that book. If you like retold fairy tales you'll like Sleeping Ugly!"
2,Hilarious!,"This is so funny. The acting is [bad], but adds to hilarity (is that even a word?) to this gory little flick. Yes it's a stupid movie, but it's funny and that is all that counts. The plot is almost too simplistic to be called that: The New Zealand government's bumbling four man anti-alien department, the Astro-Investigation and Defense Service, stumbles onto the wholesale slaughter of the small town of Kaihoro by an alien horde. And not just any aliens -- capitalist aliens! Alien entrepreneurs! Interstellar bastards who plan to promote human flesh as the latest fast-food taste sensation, under the banner of Crumm's Crunchy Delights! It's hysterical. If you get scared by seeing gore (I don't know why you would be) then stay away from this film, but for us normal people that don't follow the crowd, let's all give a big hollar out to Peter Jackson!"
1,Not at all accurate!,"Buy this book for the illustrations if you want, but don't be lured into believing that the scholarship is accurate! Cosman does NOT document her recipes (as a matter of fact, she has admitted in lectures to making some of them up), she does not give original recipes and sources, and she continually substitutes ingredients and methods unknown in Europe in the Renaissance. This book is old and the ""fantasy"" research is long outdated by the excellent work of Hieatt, Santich, Redon, Scully, and the like."
2,Funny,Some good letters in this book. It will make a great gift to my Uncle Leo who just celebrated his 98th birthday at the retirement center. He always likes a good laugh or prank.
1,Burlesque,"Had a chance to catch up with this movie last night on ABC Family. I remember seeing the commercials when it was released in theaters and was excited about going to see it, but somehow, never got to get there. I'm glad I saw it on tv. While the musical numbers and Christina's voice were wonderful, the movie itself was not very good. The dialogue, awful. Love story, weak. I was impressed by Christina's talent and Cher looks good. What it did do for me is give me more confidence about my hope to be a screenwriter one day. Because if this movie could be made with such talented stars with the awful excuse for dialogue that was used, I should be successful. When I went to bed last night there was a part of me that did want to buy it for my collection, because I did like the musical numbers. But then the sane part of me reminded me that I just saw it for free on ABC Family, so it will be on again."
2,Veggie Songs to dance by...,I have two young grandkids that love to dance to these songs. One is 18 months old and the other is almost 4 years old. What I love about these songs is that they are also teaching about the Bible and you can never start children to soon.
2,Good book,Great read. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in history. It will definitely keep you engaged and is a good source of knowledge.
1,SanDisk V-Mate,Great idea but picture resembles watching old VHS tapes!!!! There is also no caption option. Hope they are working on a better version.
2,Hot Water Fast,"This solar shower heated a full bag of water from the tap to maximum temperature in about 2 1/2 hours. The linear thermometer showed over 120 degrees. There were no clouds in the sky and the ambient temperature was about 80-85 degrees. During the shower, if you crack the filler cap a little, the flow of water out the shower end was increased. This temperature was uncomfortably warm, so we actually added some cold water to the bag. Good value!"
2,WWF wrestlemania 2000,This game will never get boring you can play it for hours at a time. The road to wresltemania is so fun and you can so that with so many different people. If you like wrestleing you have to get this game
1,Generic Junk,"The Cutter Wore A Hole In The Screen After About 3 Shaves. So Stick With TheGenuine Remington Parts. They Cost A Little Bit More, But They Last A WholeLot Longer, And They Work Much Better Too ! Check Overstock Or Drugstore.ComFor Genuine Remington Parts. Their Prices Are Good."
1,don't do it,"I am a huge Koontz fan. However this was one of the most painful book I have ever read. I did the Kindle version, and it was just page after page of not much print and or story. Interesting concept, but not my fav Koontz title. Sorry, but i can not recommend this at all."
1,A disappointment,"My friend recommended me this brand since she have heard a lot of good feedback about this. As soon as I receive this product I've tried it right away since I've been looking for a good flat iron for a long time. When I tried it my hair was catching the top edge of the plates, I have my mom and my sister try it, I thought I was using it incorrectly but it turned out they have the same problem as I have. And since the plates extend all the way at the side of the flat iron (you won't see it in the picture it is on the other side) it is very easy to burn yourself. I won't recommend this product to anybody."
1,A hodgepodge mystery...,"I thought this novel had great promise when I first started reading it, with the marriage of modern day and historical witchcraft practices and discrimination, anthropology, small town suspicions, and a gruesome murder in a remote Scotthish location. I felt that the entire storyline just dissolved about half way through the book, with no clear direction of plot or character. It also didn't help that I thought the main character to be wholly unbelievable and even a litle bit annoying with her irrational outbursts and sexual escapades with both genders. It seemed to me that the auther tried a little too hard to add twists and turns to his novel to keep the reader's interest going, but in the end had so many loose ends to tie up that it was completely unsatisfying."
2,It came with child,"To my great surprise, inside my gallon of Tuscan milk was a small orphan boy. Thank you so much! WILL BUY AGAIN!"
1,"Overpriced, not very useful","I'll be taking the USMLE in a few months, and i got this book to try to improve my study habits in anticipation of things to come, since it claims to have ""powerful strategies to help increase your score"".I have to say that for $30, this book is way overpriced and as a study aid it is completely useless. Buy this only for questions, because there are no ""strategies"" presented here. That section of this book is mostly just vague repition about studying a lot and testing yourself, and there is no clear study method presented.One of my friends recommended a smaller and cheaper, yet BETTER book called ""How to study for the USMLE"". I found it much more useful, with a clear, defined study method presented, and even more tips and strategies for doing well.If you're going to get a book to help you ace the USMLE, there are better options out there."
1,"Brevity, Clarity, Plausibilty -versus- Prolixity, Opacity, Implausibility","Although this book does contain some useful, practical information, it is buried in a forest of non-essential modifiers, unnecessarily obscure polysyllabic terms, and tortured sentence structures. Cicero wrote that the essentials of a rhetorical presentation were brevity, clarity, and plausibility. Of these three essentials, ""The Realm of Rhetoric"" comes close to achieving only the third, and doesn't achieve that one well. The plausibility of an idea decreases as the opacity of its presentation increases.The ideas expressed in this book, if expressed with brevity and clarity, would probably make a good essay. Expressed with prolixity and opacity, they make for a tedious book. Aristotle, an author not noted as an easy read, did a much better job over 2,000 years ago in his seminal work ""On Rhetoric."""
2,"A tad repetitive, but overall pretty good","Overall I really liked the CD, I just found some parts of the songs repetitive. You can repeat a lyric to make a point, and then you can really just beat it into the ground. Aside from the two or three songs where I skip the last minute, this was a really great album. Emilie is very talented both in singing and in the instruments that she plays. I am particularly fond of the voice layering effect that is prevalent in her work."
1,"eh, not so good","Well my friend Jenn and I were reading this book and we went to Ohio shortly afterwards. It turns out, the author is wrong about several key things:- the tallest tree in Marietta is 45 feet tall, not 44 (I measured it myself)- there is no statue of John Quincy Adams in Hamilton's town square.- According to my own count, fords are much more popular than Buicks in Ohio. This is surprising, in light of the Buick factory outside Jamestown, but true.Beside these factual errors, this book gave Jenn and me many helpful insights into the flora and the fauna of this remarkable state in our nation."
1,"Way to go, Hasbro","I bought the game as a Christmas gift, but it didn't work. There was some kind of electronic problem with the display screen. It would display these weird characters instead of words. I exchanged the game for another one and it had the same problem. I returned the game and got my money back. What a piece of junk."
1,Please publish wire lengths,"After about fifteen years of great performance cutting great cheeses, my cutter's wire snapped. I strongly prefer to repair rather than replace -- in this case, an otherwise perfectly good remainder of a cheese cutter. Amazon did not list the length of these replacement wires; applicable cheese cutter model numbers were listed, however, but none was mine. So I eyeballed it. And I missed. Wires too short. I did not return the wires to Amazon because their low price didn't justify the bother. But there's the customer service consideration. Amazon's is splendid and is one of its most valuable assets. Publish the wire length, boys and girls. Yours are the kinds of customers who want to know. And we appreciate and value what you do for us. What would Mr. Bezos do?"
2,A just comeuppance,"My late mother, who was affectionately called ""Mary Dear"" by my father, would have enjoyed this short, but engrossing look at marital life. Who wears the pants in this family? Well, you might (or might not) be surprised. The illustrations are delightful and the story ends up just where it should!"
1,It worked great until it died...11 months after I bought it,"I bought this because the manual frothers are messy and the battery operated chargers quickly slow down as the batteries wear down. I was careful to follow all the recommendations from other reviewers, including letting the battery run down before recharging. I loved the speed and creamy froths...until yesterday, when it refused to recharge. Now it seems my only option is to throw it away. If it had replaceable rechargeable batteries, I would give it 5 stars, but why make something that has to be thrown away after only a few months?????"
1,What was this all about?,"Okay, this guy is not who he thinks he is but everyone else in town seems to know his true identity. What his famiily does not know is what he did to them years earlier. Um...yeah. This could have been better but it is just dull."
2,oooooohhhhh yeah,"Nah, I think I would have to say that this book IS falling down funny, in fact I've never laughed so much. Burroughs, Thompson, I hear people compare Mark Leyner to so many beat or other post-modern writers, but I guarantee you that you will NEVER read something quite like this. I ended up reading at least half the book aloud to my roommate while tears were falling down my face from my fits of laughter. It may not be for everyone, but it is surely for anyone like myself that likes their humor fast, random, and fantastically absurd."
1,awful....just pictures of pictures,I have collected old postcards of the White City and several books. This DVD has no new information. It is offensively politically correct. Gene Wilder drones and is terrible. I can't overstate what a waste of money this is. I would give it zero stars as in do not buy.
1,Not as advertised,Product was advertised as NEW but it had been opened. With this type of paper it needs to be brand new to confirm that it hasn't been exposed to light. Had to ship back. Company refunded $$ but I had to pay shipping back.
2,"Nice strap, would buy again","The look of this strap is very nice. It has a sharp appearance that blends in with my Sunburst Strat without looking drastic to distract you from the guitar.It's very comfortable, and adjustable to virtually any length you could want.The fabric has a slight tendency to buckle a little, so its not a perfectly flat strap... but it is nicely padded, so I guess thats why it buckles. This is not a problem, though. I like this stap a lot and would buy it again."
2,High School Algebra,Here is a down-to-earth book on the essentials of what a student should know by they time they leave high school.
2,cute,"Sammy is a classroom guinea pig. He is usually very happy. He has all he could ever ask for. He has food and water, clean cage, and good friends who care for him. One day the children notice that Sammy seems sad. He makes a fuss while the teacher is trying to teach. The kids try and figure out what is wrong. They make sure that he is healthy. Then soon discover that Sammy is just lonley and wants some attention.In the end of the book was a list of facts about guinea pigs. I learned a lot from this list.Yes. This would be a great read aloud for a classroom that has a pet guinea pig."
1,All Hoax,"The two women were never prisoned by the talliban, that is true. But they were not aid workers like they told you. It is a propaganda from the U.S. They were spies for President Bush to oversee the the destruction of the talliban. But when they were captured, the President want them out and sent soldiers to do his job just for the cause of worthless freedom in America."
2,A woman's perspective,"Judith Sherman's Say the Name is a survivor's account of a teenage girl's struggle with God and humanity in Ravensbruck concentration camp during the Holocaust. Sherman, now a wife, mother and grandmother living in the United States, writes her memoir some 50 to 60 years after the Nazi's carried out their ""Final Solution.""Sherman's poetry and prose in this book reflect a loss of people, places and things that make up the fabric of a person's life, culture and beliefs. She is, at turns, angry and bewildered. She demands an accounting for these atrocities. But ultimately Sherman's quest for survival and her insistence on remembering the names of women who were killed conveys a sense of humanity and even of hope. This is Sherman's first book, and she is not a polished writer. She writes in fragments and one has the sense of poetry scribbled on napkins over the years and then included in the memoir. Her book is all the stronger for this."
2,"BUY THIS ALBUM, SUPPORT SKA-CORE",Just a beautiful CD. This is the kind of genius that comes from Tomas Kalnoky and his bandmates. Catch-22 isn't good anymore because he left. Catch-22's loss is Streetlight Manifesto's gain in this cd.
1,"Lackluster, not blockbuster",I am a big fan of the Twilight series and tore through them while on summer vacation a few years ago. I looked forward to Breaking Dawn but found the hype to be much more than the film itself. I think it was a big mistake to turn the final installation in the series into two separate films (obviously just to increase revenue). I found the ending of Part I to be an odd and disappointing place to cut away. The author knew what she was doing when she wrote the books and it was a travesty what the filmakers did to destroy it in this way. I was left very disappointed by this film. I should have waited for the second part to come out and then watched them both consecutively and perhaps then I wold have been more satisfied. Don't waste your time.
1,Does not work.,I bought this product to transfer files from a specific computer. It does not work. This computer has Windows XP operating system and the DataTraveler works on all other computers/laptops but the one that I bought it for. The driver won't install. I called technical support and they told me I should just return the product.
2,A Promising Start,"I first found John Ringo through his co-authored works will David Weber. They both write ""hard"" military science fiction, and this one is no differerent. Except its not so much military science fiction as medievial military fiction. True, there exists high techonology, including AIs and genetic engineering, most of the action of this book takes place with swords and bows. A well crafted work of fiction and well worth the read but mostly not sci-fi, but then it didn't claim to be."
1,Bad Movie!,"This movie was not very good! the book was so much better, don't waste your time or money on this crap! The movie was not very good adaptation of the book! if you must see it, rent it, don't buy it!"
1,Doesn't work with Intel Personal Audio player,"Don't buy it if you own an Intel Personal Audio player, they're not compatable."
1,not something I would recommend,"I purchased this product a couple months ago. It does take very nice pics, but, the darkness of the photos is disappointing, as well at the trouble with downloading via the usb port. Even with fresh batteries, an error message pops up. Essentially, you have to quickly download the images, transfer them, and erase them in about 30 seconds, otherwise it won't work. Minolta tech support isn't available when I need them, so that eliminates any help from them. What initially attracted me to this product was the price, and the small size of the camera. However, I am not impressed with it one bit. Suggest spending a little more on a better product, to avoid the frustrations. I am considering selling mine and purchasing a different product from a different manufacturer."
2,Epic..!,"This shirt is fabtabulous. So much so that it autonomously wrote it into all copies of the dictionary. It took some time before I got used to all the marriage proposals but there is no way in hell I could ever go without this shirt now. I was already pretty confident but this shirt made me absolutely sure I am awesome! I'm thinking of getting the long sleeve to increase the effective area.Since I purchased this shirt:- Have folded time and space- ABSORBED a black hole (three Wolf-Power vacuum is superior)- Found Waldo- Solved my Rubik's cube in 5.4 seconds (Would have been 4 even if I wasn't distracted by the awesome moon on my shirt)- Simply walked into Mordor (I mean who wouldn't let you in with a shirt like this??)- Won the lottery- Divided by zero- Found the meaning of life (if you're wondering, it's ""Awroooooo!!!!"")I can't even begin to rave about this shirt honestly. I'm considering having it surgically grafted to my body for a more permanent solution. I'm so happy! AWROOOOOO!"
2,Incredible,"Jane Eyre is a beautiful love story. That may sound like too simple a description for some, nevertheless, it is appropriate. If you want to read a truly classic novel that will leave you with a light heart and a smile, this is the book for you!"
1,Terrible oboe reed,I guess for 8 bucks you can't expect much. Well that's certainly true in this case. An absolutely lousy oboe reed and no amount of scraping will make it decent. Bad responsiveness and flat top octave notes. Stay away is all I can say.
1,3rd dead one,"I got a B70 for Xmas and it kept shutting off on its own, so I returned it for another B70. It had the same problem. Then I found all the reviews that said the B70 was defective, so I tried the B60. Same problem again, it won't brew unless I take out the water reservoir and put it back in. Repeat process for each cup you want to brew. The auto turn on feature doesn't work because of this, so don't expect a hassle free cup of coffee in the morning. Definitely not worth it."
1,Don't waste your time.,This book will teach you nothing other than that the author likes to self promote himself. The content is so basic that you would learn more from children selling lemonade and it would at least be cheaper and you would leave with a refreshing drink. I feel fortunate that I only borrowed it and did not purchase it.
1,Don't waste your money,This is the worst workout tape i have ever laid eyes upon. The instructor goes way too fast and doesn't give info on how to do the steps. What he does best is moves his hips as shown in the warm up and cool down. It made me wonder if i was watching an exercise tape or a porno. The only person who benefits from the tape is M.C. Cash. His dancers are tired out and the viewer is too confused to actually do anything but watch them. This video is not worth 2.00. I beg you please do not waste your money on this sorry excuse of a workout video.
1,Flexible Arm Scam,"A few of years ago, I bought a dual headset TV Ears. Technically it performed very well in terms of amplitude and tone control as well as allowing independent control of each headset. However, within a relatively short time, the ""flexible"" arms of one of the headsets snapped. I was able to glue the sections but it simply cracked in another part of the ""flexible"" arm. When I reported this to the company, I was told to simply BUY a replacement headset. In rapid order (at intervals of a few months), both ""flexible"" arms of both headsets cracked. In short, although doctors may recommend this product, according to its advertisement, it clearly needs an engineering assessment and truly flexible arms.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT without checking whether the above manufacturing improvement has been made!!"
1,Electric fire!,"When it arrived the battery claimed to be fully charged. Plugged in some stuff and popped it back on, it started beeping and powering on and off. Removed items one at a time - and then there were none and it stopped beeping and power cycling. At this point the battery showed completely dead. I left it plugged in to charge. Per the manual it should take up to 16 hours to charge, after 20 it was still only at 60%, an hour later it was down to 54%. I unplugged it and there was a flash from inside the unit and it started smoking. So thanks CyberPower, going back to Opti-UPS, I had two units for almost 5 years before their batteries died... and no fire."
2,"as good as the movie, and better!","After Seeing the village i was desperate to get the score on CD. i found that for the first time, not every song had the same sound, and i was basically correct when i listened to the score on CD. it was an amazing score using violins and making sound a lot softer but much nicer then signs, i thought it sounded so stressful, like howard was trying to acheive a fear with his score for signs. but i was pleasently surprised (as with the movie) that it was his best score yet. the movie wasn't my favorite of his, but it is my favorite when it came to twists, because there were many.anyhow, this is a great CD"
1,"Zero Sarts ALLLL the way! sorry..it sucked, and I returned, and come to think of it i never got my money back....","Dislike GREATLY!!! Im sorry, it was cheap, not durable, and falsely advertised....I didn't like it that I even returned it to get my money back, and I never got payed back. Anywho, Im sure this company makes great toys, but this one is very pitiful...dont buy it!"
2,Please judge this book by its cover!,"This is a great book about a lady who was a ""sweeper"" back in the 1950's. She managed to keep her family of 10 children afloat by winning prizes from contests. Every $1 win helped with the family finances and the big wins.....the grocery spree ($4,000 with today's dollar value), a new sports car, and $5,000 ($35,000 with today's dollar value.....really helped the family out! I highly recommend this book!"
1,Not impressed!,Thought this would be an easy way to clean....I will be going back to chemicals.....too much work for very little. The pad came apart due to the heat and moisture.
1,didn't work for me,"I put batteries in and plugged into my computer like instructed. Supposedly everything was downloaded. I turned it on and put it outside so it could find location. I pplaced it where it couldn't be seen near rear windshield. Green light was blinking. When I plugged it back into computer, not only did it NOT have any information about where car had been, the computer said the device wasn't detected!!!!. Tried to contact mfr help, but didn't get any satisfaction. If I hadn't already thrown away packing slip(spouse almost saw it!....he's the reason I got it), I would have sent it back."
1,printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!,"printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!and have fun trying to buy the photoconductor locally, because it's not sold anywhere in the greater Phoenix AZ area. basically, this printer has become the elephant in the room in my office. it's just taking up space and collecting dust!"
2,An excellent beginner's guide to Christian spiritual life,Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster is an excellent starting point for those brave travelers who wish to travel deeper into the forests of Christian Spirituality. Mr. Foster introduces us briefly to what each path holds; all the while showing us practical steps we can take to get us started in each area. This book is exceptional as an introductory not only because it gets us started down the path but because it calls us deeper and deeper in. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all Christians; and to all those interested in the life lived in and by the Spirit.
1,COME ON!!!!,"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten."
1,NOT TITO,"My favorite scene in this whole very bad movie was when all of John Travoltas cop buddies were killed and all he says is ""Not Tito?"" Who was Tito anyway? If for some strange reason that make a Face Off 2, I do beleive they should call it ""Not Tito 2"".The other big thing that annoyed me about this film, was how John Travoltas family touched each others faces. At first I would imagine it would be sweet, but after a while I would just have to say ""Stop Touching my face""."
1,Haven't we been here before?,"Well here we go with some originality. A ""comedy"", or is it a satire, about the Eighties. In my opinion it's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time. I found it's intellectual content to be shallow, acting to be marginial, and it's moralistic overtone to be questionable. First of all why does it require death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of all since when has multiple homicides been humorous? Looking over the reviews I'm not sure what I found to be worse. the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes. Perhaps the real statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction that this movies didn't invoke from people. I dare say we aren't so far removed from the Romans as we may think."
1,all sounds the same,all the songs sound the same plus they are pretty evil of a band(just look at that album names) plus the songs just have fast beats and fast guitar and thats it... and it has some singer growling really instead of singing. dont buy this album
1,"Based on hearsay, opinion, and ""psycho-analysis""","This book lacked depth and seemed to be based largely on hearsay and opinion of key people interviewed by the author. At several points, the author even asked some interviewees to comment on what they thought Hillary and/or Bill Clinton were ""feeling."" There are several attempts at a ""psychoanalysis"" of the Clintons, which would have been fine if this was a psychology book written by a psychologist, but doesn't work here at all. With any biography, I question the level of accuracy and also realize that much needs to be based on judgement or interpretation of fact; this book did not seem to present much information based on fact but rather more on unexamined opinion. Overall, a disappointing book."
2,Emo - Not Punk,"It seems a lot of people can't tell the difference between emo and punk, and I guess hardcore fans are the only exception. But that's not really the point, except that The Juliana Theory is of the ""emo"" genre, period.""Into the Dark"" and ""We're Nothing Without You"" are songs that pull at the heart, while ""To The Tune of 50,000 Screaming Children"" and ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me"" are fast-paced, if not equally thought-provoking.This CD shouldn't be labeled and aimed at a specific group of people. I know older people (guys included) that listen to and enjoy TJT. There's no limit to who can or should listen to a band or genre of music."
2,A great introduction to Vietnamese-American literature.,"This is the first book I've read by a Vietnamese author, and I enjoyed it. It gives you wonderful insight into the values and customs of American and Vietnamese characters. I thought it had bit too much poetic description mixed in with the story, but that's just my opinion."
2,clock,"i really like this clock,i just look at the ceiling and i know the temperature outside and than know how warmly to dress before leaving for work."
2,Good History,"Well written overview of the history of these battalions with very good content. My only complaint is that the men of the battalions are listed by date of death rather than alphabetically (making it hard to find a particular person). It would also have been nice if he had listed all members of the battalions, not just the dead, especially as he refers to having access to such a database in the foreword."
1,Good book if you have an uneven leg on your coffee table!,"I had to read this book for a class at American Military University. I do not have time to write in detail like Gaetan Lion did but I completely agree with him. This book is so obvious that I'm surprised that anyone gets anything out of it. Insightful? Not in the least bit. No offence to the writer, she seems like a nice person, but other than assigning her titles to things I already knew I got nothing from the book. I recommended to the college that they remove this book from their curriculum. If you are attending APUS and must read it all I can say is at least it's a quick easy read and if you agree with my review to please let the college know in the end of course survey."
1,"A bridge too far..er, ..one movie too far.","Loved the first movie, seemed the most original thing I had ever seen.Really liked the second one. The third..well I left the theater after it was over and just said to myself. "" What the hell did I just see? "" ..Lord of the Rings it ain't! But I'm compelled to buy it to complete the series. And yeah, at least the battle for Zion was fun..but that's the two stars."
2,Deals with a serious subject in an entertaining way.,Back in the Daze is an entertaining book that deals with drug addiction. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with a drug addiction.
1,This one should have been left in the freezer!,"I like Linda Blair,I must admit that was my reason for picking it up,but I'm sorry I did.I'll give you a run through the good and badThe good is that Linda Blair is in it;thats it for the good!The bad is that Blair is only on screen for about 15 minutes!More of the bad;Cheap camera,bad lighting,cheap sets,cheap audio.Almost seems like it was made for T.V. (which isn't a bad thing if the movie is entertaining,which is not the case here!)The zombies are too few and far in between.Zombies are on screen for 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FX were extremely poor!Boring as hell!Bad acting!Unfunny!Waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not in French!!!,"The comic book was in ok condition, but I wanted the French language version but got the English version instead!!Could not even return it as I took all the books as gifts to India...very disappointing!"
1,don't buy,"Just save the 3 bucks and buy a better pair. The 1st pair we bought were scratched so we sent them back. The 2nd pair are bent so we are just going to let our kids play with them. They seem good, I read the reviews that stated they loved thwm, but really they are not. They are very cheap and flimsy."
2,hey they work,"If you need a allen wrench with some nice long handles these are great, i bought both sets and am very please all and all. I recommend."
1,"Great Content, Too Bad It's Unreadable!","Alton Brown's my favorite cooking expert, and his wit is evident...if you can read it. This bood was designed, apparently, as a high-school project: Multiple pastels, reversed out recipe text in teentsy fonts, and a lousy text-size/leading ratio makes this book very hard to read. I'll never get as much benefit out of it as I could have, had not a rand amateur gotten ahold of the page layout. The book is a solid 5 stars; the design and layout are 0 stars, which renders it a waste of money to me."
1,Dry,"This is one of the most dry and boring textbooks I've had to read. The only textbook more boring than this one, that I can remember, was an anatomy book. I have a strong interest in psychology, so for me to find a psychology book to be boring, it must be pretty bad."
1,"Good dialogue, undeveloped plot","I have read several of the Spenser books. This one started very promisingly, with witty dialogue and an interesting background. But about halfway through the book, the plot gave out. Spenser gets a lucky (too lucky) break when he spots a certain photograph, but the thread it offers to unravel the mystery is only minimally drawn out. The murdered woman remains a cipher to the end, her secrets barely unveiled. Too many secondary characters are mere page-filling red herrings (the sexy secretary, the sexy Southern detective, the overaggressive teenager). The murderer eventually just confesses his/her guilt to a passive Spenser. And, worst of all, at the last moment, to create the illusion of closure, the author invents a new, unrelated crime, both nameless and motivationless, so that Spenser can have one of the suspects arrested in a sham climax. A good premise gone nowhere."
2,Great for Training Treats,"I have used these as training treats for better than a year. My maltese loves them. I don't find them to have a bad odor in the least. They are soft, so easily cut into tiny pieces for training. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.I feel they are safe and healthy for the little furbabies!"
1,Solitare Game,"buttons do not work very well, very poor product. Cannot even use. I would not recommend this game to anyone"
2,great puzzle,I bought the puzzle for my autistic nephew and he likes it as much as his other favorites.
1,Do you ever want to sleep again?,"I bought this after reading the label for ephedra and anything else I thought would be problematic. I had very few qualms--it's One A Day, after all! Talk about an established brand! After taking them for three days I had one whole night of sleeplessness! Although I've never been sensitive to caffeine before, I guess the amount of it in these vitamins is so high that I spent the most miserable night, just trying to get some sleep. I think consumers should be warned much more of that possible side effect. I threw mine away."
1,HOTMETAL MELTDOWN !,"Hotmetal Pro? I will say that this software is useful, IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WEB SITES! It is easy to use,for basic pages.There are many features which were forgotten.My advice is whether you are a novice or professional webmaster I would first look at IBM WEBSPHERE HOMEPAGE BUILDER it is a much ""simpler"" and ""useful"" software package than Hotmetal Pro will ever be. The best part is there about the same price.Check it out!"
2,Nice re-recordings,"It's different from the originals - synthesizers instead of real horns, but I like it. Old School artists often do re-recordings because they don't necessarily get royalties from re-issues. Not sure if that's true for the Bar-Kays, but they should make money from this."
1,. . . The PF's Greatest Hits . . . Not Quite . . .,"Arista's lack of care & concern for detail shines brightly in this disappointing compilation! While it may be true that the majority of the songs do indeed belong to the ""Partridges,"" there are two which clearly do not -- ""Cherish"" & ""Could It Be Forever"" -- both of which can be easily located on David Cassidy's first solo album (1972's ""Cherish"").A little bit of research goes a long way!"
1,You can buy better books,"I bought this book for my husband as a gift as soon as I found out I was pregnant. It was in a baby boutique store I like and I just grabbed it, knowing nothing about it. I/we were very disappointed in it. We found some of the information slightly inaccurate. We also thought it could have covered more and was too simplistic. There are so many good, informative, easy to read books out there that do include the dad..... I say pass on this one."
2,want to try,I can fruits and vegetables but have not tried meats yet so thought it'd be a cool book to learn something helpful & new. Can't wait to try a few.
2,Interesting Science Fiction,"The fate of the world rests with a group of young scientists who must help 'jump start' a dying sun. When their mission is diverted by a distress call from the first spaceship that disappeared in its first attempt at the same objective, this sci/fi turns into a suspense/thriller. No only is their mission now in jeopardy, but their lives as well!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Very poorly made.,"Very poor construction and quality. Very flimsy; barely took out of box a few minutes to find no functionality at all in the crane. Not durable, not fun, nor educational. Poor design, should not be sold on Amazon. Deters me from ordering similar toys.I have promptly returned the item, and am awaiting my refund confirmation."
2,Correction,"Reader Darren supplied incorrect credit for this book. Globe Pequot Press was not the original publiser. The publisher was Fast & McMillan, with the imprint of The East Woods Press, a small regional publishing group in New York City."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Elton John is one of a handful of preeminent songwriter/performers of the past half century. His work will be held as a standard for any individual who sits on a piano bench and puts his face to a microphone. About this album -- where is the sinew and muscle from this man's career? The albums ""Tumbleweed Connection,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" contained masterpiece material. Where in the world is ""Burn Down the Mission,"" ""Love Lies Bleeding,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Good Lord knows how many others. Here's the question -- Who picked this stuff?"
1,RIGHT!lol,Its oke who is this guy is he like the biggest fan ever to like Justin timberlake to be on a cd lol i mean come on hes not that good!but i think its a good idea to have tribe for Justin Hes soo awsome!such a good singer too but if i was u i rather get the REAL justin CD!~
2,Works Great!,This product does exactly what it claims to do: froth skim milk quickly and effectively. A nice tool to have if you like some froth in your coffee.
2,Excellent Overview of International Environmental Law,"Although this book is dated, the topics discussed are still worth reading. The book can still be found through the National Registry of Environmental Professionals (847) 724-6631."
1,DisneyMania 4 fails to deliver-- Don't waste your money,"I usually love Disney pop, no matter how enhanced the performers' voices are (which is usually the case, since Disney uses actors with lots of appeal and only marginal vocal talent), but this ranks as one of the most inane, bland compilations.The only songs worth listening to are ""A Dream Is a Wish"" (which is carried by the talented Raven and Alyson Michalka) and ""If I Never Knew You"" by the Cheetah Girls.The worst songs are ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Tisdale has a terrible voice, and this version of the song is constructed poorly), and Miley Cyrus's rendition of ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" which is too slow to be enjoyable."
2,was not fond of the dancing,Parts of the book took me back to my early years and junior high school dances... not what I want to read about in a SciFi book. Other than that I enjoyed the story.
2,Gluten Free,I was very excited to finally purchase this book. It is so helpful and easy to follow. Excited to make the recipes.
1,Welcome to the meatgrinder of dice throwing,"This isn't your typical Axis and Allies game. It uses similar component's regarding the board and pieces and the combat system is familiar but diffrent in many ways, but the production phase is skipped altogether and you receive random reinforcements in its place.Historic detail is nice. Most places of importance of the Normandy Campaign are on the map and the military units are named on the reinforcement boards so you get to know what you play with.The problem is with the game itself. There is very little room for tactical play and basically it is a meatgrinder of dice throwing. This maybe fun a couple of times but after that you will not be playing the game that much.I have the feeling that this game was rushed in the 60 year anniversary of D-Day and could have done with a little more playtesting."
2,romance and happy ending,the best adaption of jane eyre i've seenthe actors were perfect in their roles
2,Wonderful read,"This is an excellent book. It tells a terrific story that will capture and hold your attention. At the same time, amazingly, you'll learn some really interesting history and architecture while Follett's rich rendering of the time and customs will allow you to ""experience"" the book, if you know what I mean. You'll feel a part of it, rather than a witness. Enjoy."
2,Disturbing and overwhelming,"I deeply enjoyed the first album but it had a number of catchy tracks (Hitler in my Heart, The Rapture, Blue Angel) that pulled me in. As previous reviews have mentioned, ""I am a Bird Now"" takes a turn to the low-key, but the album more than surpasses his first effort. A skeleton of song and voice, this album is powerful, disturbing and incredibly overwhelming. One listen will not suffice, give it some time, you'll fall in love."
1,Utter Crap,"I can't think of a single cd that is worse than this piece of crap. ""I Hate Everything About You""? ""Just Like You""? All the songs sound the same and are the same, lyrically. They are just saying ""Life sucks and I hate everything."" What is the point. Such depressing subject matter would be alright if the music that went along with the lyrics would be good. This is not the case. All the guitar parts sound the same, the drumming is uninspired and the bass is laughable. I wouldn't touch this cd with a ten foot crap pole, and I would hope that if this review would stop 1 person from buying this, then I can die happy."
2,Charming biography of America's premier wood engraver,"This biography is written by family members of Cole,who is regarded as America's premier white-line wood engraver. An autobiographical introduction starts thiscolorful summary of Cole's life and work. From humbleimmigrant beginnings, he rose to the top of his craftby the end of the 19th century. The book is illustratedwith a selection of his finest work, largely fromhis work on European masters. The text is of interestto art historians, but also has a general appeal as anintriguing biography of an accomplished engraver whotravelled Europe in search of masterpieces to render in wood. He then presented the essence of the paintings to the American audience through magazines such as Scribner's and Century."
1,Don't waste your money,"It feels like a piece of junk, and, sure enough, after about 6 uses its on-off switch failed so that, this morning, it was impossible to shut off after I used it. I waited until it's battery died before putting in the trash. I've just order a ""Remington Mb1000 Complete Beard and Mustache Trimmer with Bonus Nose Ear Trimmer"" which I hope will be much better made."
2,Rose Hill Rocks,"I purchased this movie as a gift. Not only was I surprised at how swiftly I recieved the order, but that it was in such great condition. The person to whom I gave it thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
2,An excellent cd of great songs from a great singer !,"Most people probably recognize Anita Bryant more for her 1970's orange juice commercials on t.v. and for her outspokenness on the subject of gay rights, but most folks who know Anita for only those two things are really missing out on Anita's great voice. Anita had several hits in the early 1960's-""Paper Roses"", ""Till There Was You"", ""My Little Corner of the World"", etc. Those are 3 fine songs and Anita's versions are the best. Also here are standouts such as ""Pretty Lies"", ""The World of Lonely People"", ""Cold, Cold Winter"" ""The Unopened Letter"" and the plum silly ""Sleepin' at the Foot of the Bed"". Then there's the lovely ""The Wedding ( La Novia)"" and ""Step by Step, Little by Little"". Anita Bryant had a great voice like Patsy Cline, and like Patsy recorded some darn good songs! This is a great cd. it wolud have benefited from the inclusion of a few more songs. Anita 's music is romantic and swings!"
1,"Sadly, only mediocre","The premise of the book definitely has potential to be intriguing, enticing, and unusual, but the potential is just never fully realized. Two separate plots are loosely joined in the novel--the search for demonic books and the answers therein and the half-hearted muddling about a Dumas manuscript--and neither is fully fleshed out. Some of the plot twists are simply silly and the eventual denouments (two, one for each of the plots) are by turns ridiculous and boring. The main character is intriguing, but around him are assembled cardboard cut-outs of characters. Not a terrible novel, but just so much less than it could be. A shame. I was convinced to buy the book solely by the book cover promise that it was a cross between The Name of the Rose and The Three Musketeers--it is, resoundingly, not even close. Rather than buy this book, read (or re-read) either of those other two--it will be a much more satisfying investment of time."
2,"What I wanted, but too expensive.","I was pleased to receive this item right on time, and to find that it was actually an Apple product as they claimed. I do wish, however, that it was not so awfully expensive."
2,Stylish,"I love this so much it makes my bathroom look nice, its very sturdy so it never falls, Im actually thinking about buying another for my boys bathroom."
2,Hats off to Romanesca,"If I can only take one Baroque recording to a deserted island, this would be it. My favorite track in this 2-CD set is track 2 on CD#1. I must have played this track hundreds of times in my car during the past year and a half. I have never gotten tired of listening to it and doubt I ever will. I have another recording (a 1994 recording with violinist Marianne Ronez of Switzerland) of these Biber sonatas from Cavalli Records and it sounds no where as impressive as Romanesca's."
2,"Great Album, Better than his Sausages !","Every Song on this album brings back my childhood memories. I remember these playing on the radio station WHOW , Clinton , Illinois, Country Music Capital of the Midwest . I always liked his songs and acting a whole lot better than ANY of his greasyfood products !"
1,The Author is Double-Jointed,"He has to be since he spends so much time patting himself on the back. This is a bad book, pure and simple. The author spends an inordinate amount of time talking about his history of losing money and making money. But the stories aren't in great detail and come off as braggadocio. In addition, his advice is minimal and simple. He goes through the time value of money and how yields on small amounts of money invested for many years will allow you to retire well off but doesn't really give creditable advice on retiring really rich, other than buying his newsletter.I cannot emphasize enough how bad this book is. Only two other times have I not read a book I started in its entirety. Here's number three. I read the first half and scanned the last half. I assure there was no improvement. Take a pass on this turkey."
1,Who cares?,"Who cares about a posh little who*e who doesn't like the way people look and tries to ""correct""them to her liking ? Who does she think she is?Alfred Einstein? this moviis for little runts and not for anyone who know realism from fantasy."
2,Really nice book,"Thanks for writing this book. Even just reading chapter 1 got my head in a new space and helped me begin to make changes in my life in areas that seemed so difficult before. Better than a book on conversation, this book really cuts to the heart of dealing with tough issues, what you can do about them, and how to get better results at work and at home. I want to meet these guys!"
2,buy this book!,As a graduate from Bible college I can assure you that this lexicon is excellent for those with no knowledge of the greek. It is easily laid out and is well worth the price
1,This book is demeaning and redundant.,This is a book for cowards seeking some facet or excuse to call themselves alcholics. It spells out in subtle ways the nature of a CULT. This book revels in a POWERLESSNESS theory and claims that a drinker has a disease. For anyone who would like to become a part of a herd of stupid sheep. This is a great organization
1,Piece of garbage,"These people have a warranty for 60 days. There is no phone number and no customer service whatsoever. They will not respond to your emails.That being said, I have purchased 2 of these, the cloth is SHREDDING BY ITSELF. I purchased them 7 months ago, and they are literally just falling apart. After 3 months, the color completely faded, after 7 months, the material simply started shredding. This is a horrible waste of money, looks great for 3 months, and after that, you might as well flush $200 down the toilet."
2,Holl@ from Delaware!!!!!,"HOlla!!! the newsies was the best musical ever!!!! i loved it so much! iF you haven't seen it yet, see it right away!! I thought it was unnecassary for the girl to kiss him in the end cuz she hardly saw him the whole movie. and she only sang one line in the whole movie!!!! well besides that, i loved the movie and i am planning on doing it as a show in a few years. well buy the dvd as soon as possible and the soundtrack(you will hear them singing in your head while your sleeping) cyaz!!!"
2,Awesome!!,Best series ever! Finished this book in three das amd immediately jumped to the next one. Fun at evry scene and thrilling adveture! I greatly advise anyone to read and enjoy R.A. Salvatore and his many works
1,A New Song,"Having read the 5th book in the Miford series first, I appreciated the character reviews that Jan Karon gave. I got so engrossed in those characters that I am now starting the read At Home In Mitford and intend to read all of the Mitford books. As I grew up in a Methodist parsonage, these books with Father Tim are very heart warming to me. I'm glad Karon gave those small character reviews for me."
2,It actually works.,"I'm 15 this year, and I actually enjoy this book. Believe me, I've tried for a while to find a good vocab book. ""1100 words you need to know"" seriously sux, and the rest of them are pretty bad too. The only other good one is a very small section in ""Up your score"". But anyway, this book is a page per word with a huge picture in the middle and a few sentences with the word in it at the bottom. Then once in a while there's a review. THis is the first book I have used where I have actually remembered the word after say about a week. And if you don't want to fall asleep memorizing the word in the first place, this is the book for you. Buy it. It works."
1,"Save your money, this is a flawed product.","Flawed prodeuct, sold on philips outlet for $19. USB 1.0 device. Flawed with errors.Save your time and frustration, don't buy."
2,tori hits with her best shot,"Tori Amos continues her brilliant lyrical and writing brillinace with ""Bliss"". The song is solid, quite lovely, works well with live performances as well. While it does not top ""Crucify"", ""Jackie's Strength"", or ""God"", its a fine change of pace from the Ricky Martin/Britney Spears radio opputunities.Hope the rest of ""Venus"" is as charming as ""Bliss""."
1,This is it. I've had it.,"If you like the trendy Jars of Clay music, which is dragging every other artist in Christian music into a deep pit of boring ballads for the next 20 or 30 years, buy this album. If you are concerned about the fact that Petra's ministry has lost many fans over the past 2 years, email me at socko130@hotmail.comNow that i've let that out, I'm gonna pop in some of the old stuff. If you are mad at me, sorry. I just noticed that Petra is really weak right now. They haven't been on WOW for a few years either."
1,"A thin, underwritten disappointment.","I went into this book with high expectations, seeing as how there are so many people who enjoyed it. It read more like a plot outline than an actual novel, with thin characters, sketchy descriptions, little sense of mood or atmosphere, and a plot one finds it hard to care two cents about. Too bad, as I really wanted to like it. The point of view of Croaker is mildly interesting, but never really developed into a character driven piece that engages the reader. And all that silliness between One-Eye and Goblin... puh-lease. I guess if you've read every other fantasy ""formula"" out there, you might find this one diverting. As for me, I'm still finding much more interesting fare to read..."
1,Water Resistant?! Nice joke.,"Within the first month I had to replace this product because it had condensation on the inside. The customer service told me that it is not water resistant despite the logo of a guy swimming on the back of the watch and ""30 feet water resistant"". Just this week, after having been very careful not to get it wet, and taking it off before jumping in the shower, the new watch got more condensation in it and stopped working. It must have been the steam in the shower!! Terrible buy. I wish they would reimburse the purchase or issue a recall. This is not something an American company should be producing."
1,don't like taste at all,"I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better. I know taste preference is all subjective. But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point. After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it. I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters. I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low."
1,"Don't Buy This Phone, Static, Bad Reception","I buy 3 all they have very bad recepcion even being near the Handsets,, a lot of static, the functions are a messdon't throw your money buy another phone !!!!"
2,It sure was a good decision to buy this one!,"I had already owned Peter Gabriel's ""So"" and ""Us"" before I decided to get this fine collection of his solo material, some of which I was familiar with. Besides ""Sledgehammer"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Don't Give Up"", ""Red Rain"", and ""Big Time"" (Where's ""In Your Eyes"", anyway?), all from ""So"", my other favorites are ""Solsbury Hill"", ""I Don't Remember"", ""Shaking The Tree"" itself, ""San Jacinto"", the new-for-this-collection ""Here Comes The Flood"", the particularly strange and bizarre-lyric-filled ""Games Without Frontiers"", and my absolute favorite ""Shock The Monkey"", albeit in edited form, as opposed to the version I heard on the radio. So, now, beside fellow Genesis veteran Phil Collins' ""Hits"" CD, this is a must for anyone's adult-contemporary collection. I'd recommend it heavily!"
2,D-Mannose Powder,My daughter told me about this powder and I researched it online before purchasing. I was impressed and it works wonders. I add it to unsweetened orange juice 2 - 3 times a day and again at bedtime. Knocked an impending urinary infection right away. No more pain in such a short amount of time. I will use this as a daily routine @ 1 - 2 tsp per day from now on.
1,"Great Idea, bad product",I really thought it would be nice and cheaper to use a coffee of my choice but found out that the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter is messy and hard to clean. You have to change out a attachment on your machine to use this which is another inconvenience plus I always wind up with coffee grains in my cup and the coffee comes out weak. I like the idea but this gadget is not the answer.But as far as the Keurig coffee maker goes it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
2,I actually enjoy the aerobics!,"This was my first Karen Voight video, and I love it! I am not a big fan of aerobics (I hate to sweat!), but I really enjoy this routine. Mostly I like Karen. She gets me motivated to work hard, even though I have to pull out the towel and turn on the fan. :) I also love the bodyscultping section. I can feel the burn, and it's a great all over workout. I don't do both sections in one session, simply because after aerobics I can't concentrate on more focused moves like weights. Karen is one of my favorite two instructors, and I would definitely recommend this video."
2,refreshing view of the complicated situation,this book provides new and important information about the Maoist/royal struggle and offers a view and honesty not found in mainstream media. it is up to date and should definately be read by those truly interested in the actual state of living in Nepal at the moment.
2,fun,"my daughter was so excited to get this scooter she cant wait to ride it it shipped very quickly and looking forward to a lot of fun,"
2,Card Speed Versus Camera write Speed,"I have the canon s45 and this card has worked great with it for the past year. People have to really pay attention the the tech specs of the cameras that they buy, all write speeds are NOT the same for ALL cameras. The size and type of file you shoot can greatly affect the write speed also. Dpreview.com lists hundreds of camera reviews and specs, more than you ever wanted to know about digital cameras. Go there BEFORE you buy, be an INFORMED CONSUMER !!! I see so many complaints about CF cards that have to do with assumptions and not facts. amen."
1,Cut beyond recognition,"Originally saw this film by it's release title: ""Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle"" and the cuts and edits required to remove the lead characters name in addition to the cuts made to make this have a R rating render this a slim shadow of the originally funny (albeit tasteless)animated comedy. This pale version of the original is basically worthless and difficult (if not impossible) to follow."
2,an entertaining book with serious underpinnings,"With ""Streets on Fire"" John Shannon delivers another winning book, as entertaining a read as anything he's done, despite his audacity in throwing some relevant political content into the mix. I have to agree with Charlotte Vale Allen's bewilderment at the vitriol in the PW review--does a genre book have to be witlessly apolitical to be worth a reader's time and effort?"
2,The definitive collection,"This is the definitive Gene Pitney collection : two CDs with all the chart hits, a generous helping of B-sides, albums tracks, and lesser-known gems in excellent remastered sound, plus a booklet with photos of LP and 45 sleeves and track-by-track commentary by Gene Pitney himself ... and all at the price of a single CD. Marvellous!"
1,Culinary Crap,"Leaks, even with leak guard on. Grates well if you use a small amount of food at once, but forget it if you want to try to hash a couple of potatoes at once. You'll wind up with some potato mush and some potato chunks. And speaking of CHUNKS....the reason I really don't like this thing is because the slicer/shredder disk doesn't just shred, it slices all at the same time! If you want cheese shreds, be prepared for shred/chunks. The problem is that as the food passes between the shred holes on the disk, it slips down into the dull side of the slicer hole and slices at the same time! This is my first processor; maybe all of them with the reversible disk work this way. I know processors are supposed to be multi-taskes, but only when you want them to be. Geesh! This one's going back to the store."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased 2 sets of these glasses, all the same strength. They are exactly what was advertised. No Frills - Durable all the same style. They look like they are a unisex style with the frames being neither male or female in style. I use them as extras around the house. Both my husband and I can use them. Cheap and Easy!"
1,They stick it to you with impossible-to-open bottle.,"I spent a full hour twisting the cap every which way and still have been unable to open it. There are no instructions for opening anywhere on the bottle or cardboard packaging. Who cares how strong the glue is inside if you can't ever get to it? ADDED NOTE: With many months having elasped since I originally posted this review, I see that this and the one other highly critical review were both marked ""unhelpful."" Could it be that employees of the manufacturer give negative reviews a low ranking? It seems hard to believe that so many people would find it unhelpful to be warned that a glue product might arrive with the cap stuck closed, rendering the product useless. Granted, I might have received one faulty container -- an exception to the other ones that open with no problem -- but, well, I'm just saying . . ."
2,"Bubble Mailers, work with creases","These are fine, except they have some of them have some creases on the fronts, making it a little difficult to write addresses - have to make sure the crease doesn't affect the info the post office needs!"
1,Bad Stitching,"We bought 3 of these bags & 2 of the 3 were defective. The straps were not stitched well & broke 10 min into our hike. We had to tie different straps together to continue the hike. We are returning them for a refund, beware check stitching if you buy this backpack."
2,Health Care Financing,"Anybody that is concerned about the rising costs of health care in America should read this book. As a physician, I am disappointed at the lack of leadership in medicine as well as among the politicians.We are sending the current bills for health care to our children. Gov Lamm's book provides great insight into the fiscal problems we are facing and provides some good suggestions on how we might go about addressing the problem."
2,"All good, but the ending.","I thought that this book was really good.I loved the way it always had somthing going on to keep your intrest. The only thing i didn't like about it is the ending, it kind of dissapointed me."
1,But I love Fear Street!,"Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please ""adults"" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books."
2,Underrated,"This is one of my favorite Newman albums. Mr. Sardonic is at his best here, from the album cover(a comment on the success of Little Criminals), to the very last song. Favs include The story of a rock and roll band(a tribute to ELO)Pretty Boys, William Brown, and Half a Man. Extremely under-rated, it's a must have for fans of Randy Newman."
1,worst ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game is impossimble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i can't beat the first level with tahu,you have to make a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong jump!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great Read,"A quick, easy read this book opens your eyes to the crazy life of the top professional poker players."
1,plextor: you do not get what you pay for,"I just wanted to pipe in that I also, was one of those people that had this drive fail on themMy drive was manufactured in February of 2005, and It lasted monthly burns for 370 days, then it failed. It's got a one year warranty, I used it 12 times to burn CD's/DVD's and it fails. Hows that for reliability?! Stay away from this company!Maybe I will give the highly rated Samsung a shot..."
2,High pedigree: Gal Costa with Cesar Camargo Mariano,"When you read my reviews on Elis Regina's albums you will certainly know of Cesar Camargo Mariano, one of the greatest arrangers for singers in Brazil. He was her arranger for many many albums, thanks God!, her best ones.I am used to saying that no matter the singer is, if the arranger is Camargo Mariano, buy it.This is the case for this Gal Costa album. Beautiful renditions, beautiful arrangements. Buy it."
2,A thoughtful look at the romance genre.,"This is a great collection of scholarly essays by well-known romance authors about the genre. Any serious romance fan will find this a fascinting read. I was continually impressed by the profound insights in this book. Not only is it a compelling response to the many unenlightened critics of the genre, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of how romance novels reflect the changing face of women's issues in this country. I particularly enjoyed the article by Susan Elizabeth Phillips called ""The Romance and the Empowerment of Women."" Also, Laura Kinsale's article about how readers respond to the point of view of the narrative was fascinating. This should be mandatory reading for all romance editors."
1,The definition of poorly-written historical fiction,"Poorly written, with wooden characters. The history is there, but the writing quality isn't. Fie on the WSJ reviewer who listed it as a must read -- this was to writing as Kenny G. is to jazz"
2,Sling Blade,Just another item that my son asked for for Christmas! No where else to find it at such a great price! Speedy delivery! Awesome!
2,Good coffee maker,Heats the water to 180 degrees F which is hot enought to brew green tea and make a good cup of coffee. It is well worth the amount of money I paid for it. I do recomend this product.
1,Not Bossy Enough,"There really isn't all that much when it comes to good party songs, and even as good hip hop songs. That has been the case with Kelis. Although she need a infectious groove with Milkshake a few years ago, her latest single doesn't actually capture the status she had before. Bossy, the first single from her upcoming record Kelis Was Here is a very weak song that doesn't deliver very well. The song isn't anything over the top where you could dance to the music and enjoy it. Although it is fair at first, it just gets quickly tiresome. This is really one of the very few tracks that isn't what it delivers as bossy.Song: D+"
2,Some good songs,"There are a few good songs on this cd, especially the first one How to Save a Life by the Fray. I love Grey's Anatomy and the producers really picked the songs for the soundtrack well b/c each song reminds me of the show somehow."
1,Not Good,This is not for beginners--not everyone can teach people how to dance and this is one of those instances. The instructor goes so fast... she does not give you time to really get the moves down before she goes into the next routine.I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. There are other DVD's out there and I would strongly suggest getting one that is for beginners and where the instructor does enough reps to make sure that you are following it. Rania has some good ones that have helped me.If you have the belly dancing basics and want to give yourself a challenge then this may work for you. I am just learning and it was hard to keep up since I am still ackward on my feet and with swinging my hips.
1,Prepare to wash your eyes.,"This book changed my life. For the worst. I used to be a functioning member of society. These sayings have lead me so far astray that my own mother refuses to speak to me. Or perhaps it's the creepy cover of this book. Those eyes, they haunt me. I used to be happy."
2,Loved It!,This movie is so fun. I sure hope that the two of them make more movies of the type again. Loved it!
2,GREAT for all ages!,"We gave the stomp rocket as a gift to a three year-old boy. Of course he loves it. The best part is who else loves it! His 30-something parents, his 5 year-old sister and her friends and basically anyone who visits their yard. Adults love to see how far they can make the rockets go, kids love to use up all of their excessive kid energy stomping on the stomp mechanism. We just purchased another one for ourselves - will be put to good use by our 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old daughters. Great value - great fun. It's also quite safe - all the parts are soft, so even if a child, car, house, etc. gets hit, there is no injury or damage."
2,This Rocks,Paul has always been a classic along with Christy Moore. The recordings were well mastered and are great listening. Rock on!
2,I feel compelled,"I feel compelled to put in my two or three cent review before reading what others have said. I purchased the DVD set months before watching a single episode. It sat gathering dust because I was expecting a perhaps lust-ier regurgitation of all that we've seen about gay people's lives...sadness, pain, rejection, humiliation offset by a laughing caricature-like character or few who would say, ""Its all OK.""What I started out with, as I sat down to go through my children's out-grown clothing, was a view of the lives of people who were gay AND human beings with real lives and...um stuff. What I ended up with was a closet of messy children's clothing because I was compelled to watch undistracted. I immediately purchased the rest of the seasons and was a gruesome addict to the end.I've seen the Lesbiyawn series The Lword. When will they get a show as powerful and clever as QAF? I can say that because I've dated a few..."
2,F-ing funny as can f-ing be,"This movie was what I had hoped for and a lot more; a silly, raunchy, vulgar, and profane bit of Jack Black driven insanity that makes you laugh and laugh hard. The f-bombs drop continuously as if there was a quota that needed to be reached and you end up laughing just at the pure ridiculousness of it all. In addition, the songs are so bloody hilarious that I dare you not to find yourself repeating them, vulgarities and all, as you go about your life in the days to follow. Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters/Nirvana shows up in an excellent cameo as Satan but it's the priceless scene just before that one that really had me howling. It's the little voice that lives inside of you...This is the kind of movie you watch for the pure pig in mud joy of it. I've already rolled in it a half dozen times and have enjoyed every moment.As for the extras, there are fourteen deleted/extended scenes, featurettes, music videos and more."
2,Another inspiration..,"Another wonderful book, thank you! You will take away so much more than your expected, enjoy!"
1,"Nice design, but poor quality","I bought this set of headphones to use with my iPod while jogging. I like the black & white color and compact folding design, but the poor quality of craftmanship drops its rating substantially. First, the headphones could not be used with the treadmills at the gym because they would build up static electricity and shock the ears (the classic yellow ones that came with the Sony Walkmans years ago never had that problem). But even given that limitation, I would have still given this product a 3 or 4 star rating if it were reliable. However, the left speaker went out after only 5 months, rendering the headphones unusable. Sony provides only a 3-month warranty on this item, of course. In contrast, I still have a set of the old-style yellow Sony Walkman headphones that are still working fine (it just doesn't match the color of my iPod)."
1,Not bad,"It works as advertised. I've only charged so I can't confirm if it also syncs. I give the product a 3 but knocked the rating down to a 2 because of Boxwave's service. I ordered 2 sets of the bundle that was supposed to come with with a car adapter, however they only sent me both cables without the adapter. These were separate orders and Boxwave messed up on both my orders. I've already communicated with them and they said they are looking into it. It has almost been 2 weeks and nothings happened. As others have mentioned, the casing on the lightening cable end is a bit larger than the OEM cable so those with a case that has a small opening may have issues."
2,Insightful Journey to India,"Told through rich imagery along the sacred waters of the Ganga River, Claire invites you to embark on a very personal journey of self-revelation and spiritual growth. Her search to know and serve God is fueled by a willingness to leave behind past attitudes and to love without judgement or separation. Faithful effort is given to understanding situations that arise and learning that there are no accidents. When met with the unexpected river voyager - be it human or animal - Claire's account is told with humor and honesty. You feel her rapture with each realization and her uncertainty with each challenge. I hope she takes the advice of her newfound `angel' and visits Nepal. We could all benefit from the trip."
2,I'm Glad I Bought This CD,"I Bought This CD Because Of Walkin On The Sun. But When I Listened To ALL of the songs on it, most of them SHOULD be hits. This band can do anything. From the hard rock of Flo to the Soft Rock of Why Can't We Be Friends."
2,A good summary of Hitler's war against the Jews,"This is definitely a must read for any student of the Holocaust. Gilbert, however, fails to focus on the numerous other victims, such as Poles and Soviet POWs. In other words, he does not attempt to analyze the Holocaust from every angle. In order to understand the evolution of the Holocaust, one must be aware of the euthanasia program under Hitler and other oppressive measures against criminals, communists, asocials, and other ""undesirables"" which were practiced under the Third Reich long before the extermination of the Jews began."
1,Lasted all of 2 days with my 5 yr old,"My 5 yr old loved the toy, problem is quality of the product is crappy. The ball bearing the beyblade spins on came out on the very first day playing in the kitchen area on tiles.The 'lock' is plastic and that broke on the second day. Overall, my 5 yr old played with it for about 2 days while it worked, and then improvised to play with it for maybe another 4-5 days as he was real excited to have it. Anyway for $20+ product I would have expected a better quality."
1,One of the worst albums that I have listened to.,All of the songs sound the same with no variety. Sounds like he made it in his bathroom.
1,Defective product-just a heads-up.,"This is a copy-protected cd. Why is this a problem?a) It can't be copied, even for legally accepted personal use.b) It *will not* play on computer cdrom drives, playstation, dvd players, or many portable car cd players.Basically, it's useless. I received a promo copy that won't even play on my *regular* stereo, which is gathering dust in the spare bedroom. Hm. So, in addition to everything else, it doesn't play on *old* cd players either. As it turns out, Universal will be manufacturing all copies of this title this way, and will be moving ""most"" of its catalog to this format in 2002.This cd *does not* conform to the Red Book Compact Disc audio requirements, and therefore qualifies as a defective product, not even as a cd per se.I have no real interest in ""ripping"" this, as there are only a couple of songs that seem like they might be interesting, but as I listen to all my cds on one of two computers or the PS2, I can't even listen to the thing.Consumer beware."
1,"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.",I am a HUGE SOUTH PARK FAN but this thing STUNK. They hurried up and cashed in on the popularity of the series. Even my two kids wanted to leave the theatre because they were bored with it.
2,Excellent product for the price.,Completely satisfied. First night entertaining went really well. Would recommend it. Looking forward to putting a lot more use into this product.
1,"Disappointed, misleaing","VERY disappointed! The curtains took 6 months to arrive, then instead of getting the Galatic Heroes curtains with the Star Wars images, what I received was blue curtains with the Star Wars logo screen printed instead.The picture did show curtains WITH the images!!! That is what I wanted but not what I received."
1,Not a Novel Novel.,"I really wanted to like this book. To my surprise it took me three attempts to finish, I was that bored. I tried to give it yet another chance by listening to the audio version, but the result was sadly the same: I found little in terms of the characters, their shared experiences during China's cultural revolution and the author's message on the transcendent power of literature that was new or refreshing."
1,wrong item than what I thought it was going to be,The shipping was quick and well packaged. But it was not what I thought it was going to be. I will probably give to to someone who can use it.
2,Dog Lover,Great treat for training and rewarding your pet. My dog loves these treats. The size works so well for my dogs too.
2,Good Read.,What's there not to like about Virginia Woolf's writings. She writes well. Her book To the Lighthouse is required college reading. I love all her stories.
1,Unconfotable and possible wrist injury,"The trackball jumps a spot every now and then and after a while, the position of your wrist makes it painful to continue.I went back to my ergonomic Logitech."
1,Product description lacking detail,"I've heard great things and was excited to try Maca. What concerns me is that vitamin E is listed as an ingredient in this product, but the amount is left off of the label. If you are like me and take other vitamin supplements as well, you need to make sure you aren't over doing it on some areas. Since I have no way of knowing how much vitamin E is in this product, I feel uncomfortable taking it with my other multivitamins. High doses of vitamin E are not good for you. It wouldn't have taken the company much work to fix this inconsistency, but I won't buy this product again unless it's properly labelled. It's cheaper than other brands, but I'll pay a little more in the future to not have to worry."
2,An unknown jewel of a performance!,"First of all, after all those Opera D'Oro recordings I've been listening to lately, this Orfeo recording has outstanding sound. The principals give their best; I was particularly impressed with Cotrubas, whom I associate with less full-blooded roles, and Francisco Araiza, in a rare foray ut of his usual Mozart/ Rossini repetoire. Bruson is perfection, as usual. Gardelli keeps things moving at a brisk pace. This is the only commercially recorded performance of this rare opera. I got it used and I am glad I did!"
2,Makes You Think of 1985,"I was at a concert last night in Berkley, CA and at the GreekTheater, Mark Knopfler played all 4 of these classics, So FarAway, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, & Brothers in Arms. Otherthan that, he played Telegraph Road. Very good. Anyway, this isa good album! Maybe a little not as good as either Making Movies,or Love over Gold. All these songs are pretty good!! I think theMoney for Nothing on here I think is done really well and I liketo repeat it over N' over again. Sometimes 3 when even better.Also, check out Your Last Trick, Why Worry, Ride Across the River, The Mans Too Strong, and One World."
2,Deserves 6 Stars!,"Dwight's voice is like a knife that tears into my soul with stinging sweetness and his lyrics are mesmerizing. He's a singing storyteller who is in a league of his own. I can hardly articulate what I find most impressive about Dwight, and what appeals to me about this particular album. It's beautifully stark, traditional yet contemporary, the lyrics are honest and descriptive, the production is fine and music first-rate. This album is classic, just like Dwight. Part of the making of a Legend. No wonder Buck Owens and Johnny Cash liked him and thought of him as a worthy successor. He was and still is. I just wonder when he will get the recognition he is due??"
1,...irritating...,"When I first listened to 'One Heart' there was, or so I thought, either some dust or other debris on the disc because of an irritating 'skip' during ""I Drove All Night."" I cleaned the disc only to find that this did not rectify the problem. So I returned the disc stating that it had a defect. Well, it turns out that this 'defect' is also disappointingly apparent on the replacement disc. I am surprised that no other reviewer has mentioned this.At 3' 24"" into ""I Drove..."" there is a very irritating pause, however brief. I love the song but this pause is extremely annoying at best. In my opinion it nearly completely ruins this great song.I find the rest of the songs to be mediocre. This is not one of Celine's best offerings. 'One Heart' is good and the new version of 'Sorry for Love' is probably my fave on the disc, but the original version was much better.As a Celine Dion fan, I am disappointed."
2,Chapter 3 alone would be worth the cost!,The must have Perl resource. It was written by the the creator of Perl for goodness sake! Offers thorough reference to Perl's rich set of text manipulation features. Not a tutorial but more of a intermediate/expert reference manual. Get Learning Perl(Camel Book) and this book. You will be a perl hacker in no time flat!
2,GET THE EXTENSION KIT!!!,I purchased this with my Play Yard and connects easily. I love this product.
1,"not the ""classic"" Fireman Sam","My son was very disappointed with this dvd. He said, I want to watch the ""plain"" Fireman Sam....This is the new computer animated version, more action, a bit more drama, but still ok, for little kids..We will stick with the ""plain"" versions!:)"
1,Another diet book you can toss,"The only reason I can think of for this book to be a best seller is that it has a catchy name; couple that in the diet world where people are always searching for that miracle and there you have it. The first chapter or so has you thinking it is a refreshing book with a nononsense attitude about it. However, the foul language and writing as if all written word is fact is a put off by chapter 3. (Yes, sometimes with research but on topics very ""gray""). Some of their opinions are good ones: don't eat sugar, excercise, etc. so take the rest with a grain of salt. Losing weight or staying fit will always come down to eating properly portioned, healthy food and excercising. PERIOD"
2,It was good!,"I have read every book on the Oprah list except Paradise, and have found all of them too be good. I was expecting more out of this novel than i received. It was a wonderful novel, but could have been more.WHen I began reading it I had a hard time getting into it but once i got in it, I couldn't get out. I felt the pain and abuse that ""Beth,"" had endured. The ending was a little expected and I was able to figure out most of the book before it happened.NOnetheless i recommend the book..."
2,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy,",All my cats love this! We have seven. Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy is sturdy and heavy duty. The scratch area is a win with they also.
2,So far so good,"These adapters seem sturdy enough. If you need an RCA-to-1/4"" mono adapter, these should be fine, and the price is certainly reasonable.I had some that I bought at Radio Shack a few years ago for three times the price, and the cement that holds the tips inside the shaft would fail. When I removed the adapter from the jack it was plugged into, the tip would remain in the jack. It was very difficult to remove it. So far this has not happened with these.I have some similar adapters that are at least twenty years old, and I've never had a problem with them. These are not quite as substantial as the old ones. I hope these will do as well."
2,"Canadian disc, not too much of an issue","Like title says, it's a Canadian disc but that just means it says ""Herós"" in smaller letters in some spots. Takes a bit longer to load on my USA NTSC Panasonic Blu-ray player, but it warns you of that. After the initial load, the rest plays fine, no pauses in scene transitions. Transfer is pretty good for a film that's over 10 years old. Trust me, this film is worth Blu-ray. If you've never seen it, the color schemes are just brilliant and look beyond beautiful in enhanced quality. Shipping took about a day or 2 extra but for $8 and change, I can't complain."
1,Puh-leeze,"I picked up this disjointed piece of dreck at the local library booksale. (If nobody checks out a book for more than two or three years, they don't keep it. Now I know why.) Turns out it was a total waste of my 25 cents. Mr. Thomas ""uncovers"" conspiratorial ""connections"" which would only be plausible to an intellectually-challenged, unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic. See, the Gubbament doesn't want you to know about Stuff, see, and so they like, brainwash people and stuff, see ... it's a fact! Puh-leeze, the X-files was fiction there, bubba. It is illuminating to note that two of the 5-star reviews for this windy and disjointed diatribe are by the author himself, and another touts how utterly engrossing it was for an eight-year-old. Ahem. In short, if you are in need of kindling, I heartily recommend you check out this author's other vanity press works. And K-k-k-ken(n), better kept your curtains closed, 'cause THEY'RE WATCHING!!! Ooooooo, scary!"
2,Interesting and unusual recipes.,"""Party Recipes"" has many interesting and unusual recipes. I have tried several of them already with great success. This book is so interesting that even my husband has picked it up and found favorites for himself."
1,"not the best guide, but not bad","Peterson's guide was my first as a child, so I don't want to bad mouth it, but it is not the best. Since then I have used just about every other guide available. Peterson's seems to have fallen behind in several areas. The illustrations are not as good as those in the National Geographic guide. The accidental and exoctic species are listed seperatly at the end of the book, and not all of the birds listed are shown!!! Im not sure if this is a mistake or not. Accidentals are also shown seperately, not alongside similar species or birds with similar appearance. This makes it somewhat confusing to identify some birds. Very little information is given about them, and usually there is nothing more than a head shot. I wouldn't use it as a primary reference, but it does make a good companion to other guides, especially ones with photographs rather than watercolors."
2,Must Have!,There is never enough memory on the original cards. This is a must have for those vacation trips and storing pictures.
1,What?,"First of all let me just say that Erick Morillo is excellent 'live'. His legendary sets at Space and Crobar are beyond comparison. However, he really dissapoints with this ""played out"" mix. The track selection is so old and played out...it makes me wonder if he is truly connected with what is happening in the scene.If I hadn't heard him live then I would think that Morillo is washed up."
1,Two stroke penalty,I expected various tips on the practice range. But the author uses only 18 out of 179 pages for range tips. The rest of the book is for ordinary swing instructions and 'faults and fixes' with real people.There are a lot of good books on golf swing; I don't want to know anything about Seattle golfers particularly. I already have David Leadbetter's 'Faults and Fixes' and it's a good book. The author of 'Home on the Range' didn't have focus on his title.
2,Experience some gaming history!,"These are indeed old games, and as such, they don't look anywhere near as good as newer games. However, there are a bunch of classics here that should be experienced by any fan of PC gaming. If you love getting immersed inside a virtual world, practically all these games will deliver the goods. And printed manuals? Almost unheard of these days! If you are a true fan and don't mind tweaking your system a bit to get them running, there are hundreds of hours of fun to be had with this massive collection."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR: MUTILATED VERSION!!,"The good news here is that the sound and image restorations are very good. The bad news, it was a worthless effort. This specific DVD comes in at 47 minutes, 15 minutes short of the film's actual 62 minute run time. Avoid this turkey like a cursed jewel."
1,Died after 2 years of use,I used it twice a month for 2 years & one day it just stopped working. The motor was still spinning but on less speed & couldn't cut anything.It's heavy & the blade gets dull relatively fast compare to other machines. I am looking for a different manufacturer or model now.
2,four ghost stories,an older book but still good interesting read for those who love ghost stories and the world of the unknown
1,Beautiful but NOT FUNNY and TOUCHING as the original movies produced in the 1950s,"These short movies look beautiful and more modern than the original ones produced in the 1950s. However, the old ones are much funnier and more touching.This DVD contains 12 episodes. They are: Accidental Hero, Bully For You, Disarmed and Dangerous, Dragon Quest, Fang Decay, Frankenleftovers, Grimly Day, Opposite Day, Ra-minator, Rich Kid Ra, Scare Day, Weekend at Bunny's.In short, this DVD is worth borrowing but not purchasing.I own the old Casper movies on 4 DVDs. They are titled Best of Casper vol. 1, Best of Casper vol. 2, Casper and Wendy - Scare Up Some Fun, Casper Trick Or Treat. Each contains 12 episodes. The have brought me countless humorous times and warm feeling."
1,Problem where you have other phones on the same line,"Works well except that when there's an incoming call that is picked up in one of the other phones in the house and it's for me, when I pick up my phone (the one connected to Comswitch)all I get is a busy signal. To pick up the call, I have to use another phone in another room. Is there a solution?"
2,this game rocks!!!!!!,"This game packs plenty of dodge and shoot action. And it has action/adventure, so if you like that you will like this game. This is a good place to buy it I should know I have the game. Oh yeah I almost forgot(trust me on this don't get this game off of EBAY)... I'm going to let you know this but ""MegaMan blue vesion"" is a little harder than ""MegaMan white vesion""Salim ta-ta"
2,Buena calidad,"producto de buena calidad, trae instrucciones detalladas de uso, valvula de liberacion para no tener que conectar y desconectar. se ve algo fragil, asi que manipular con cuidado."
1,Did not work for my dog,I was hoping this product would be the cure to my dog's barking...it seemed to work for about two days....but then my dog decided she didn't mind the citronella spray...and she's barking just as loudly as ever with the collar on and squirting her in the face! I would not recommend this product...as I'm out $36 with nothing to show for it.
2,AWESOME RUSH CONCERT,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR RUSH TO MAKE A LIVE CONCERT DVD,FINALLY AFTER WATCHING RUSH IN RIO,I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.GEDDY ALEX AND NEIL WERE RIGHT ON KEY, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN I EVER HEARD THEM BEFORE.I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CROUD OF 60,000 PEOPLE THAT WERE SO MUCH INTO THE MUSIC AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS FOCUSED ON THE BAND.IN MY OPINION RUSH IS SIMPLY AWESOME,GEDDY'S VOICE WAS BETTER THAN EVER,HIS BASS RUNS WERE FLAWLESS,ALEX'S SPACEY GUITAR RIFFS WERE FANTASTIC AND I COULD FEEL THE POWER OF NEIL'S DRUMS WITH EVERY BEAT.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUSH IN RIO.... JTF"
1,Item not received,I never received the item nor was informed that it was not coming. The item was supposed to have been lost in the mail and I have been promised a refund.
2,Quality component,I bought this for a 2006 Hyundai Elantra. It fits perfectly and works perfectly. This is a lot easier and more reliable then trying to splice together a generic sensor. Get this one. It fits and it works great!
1,This is retarded,"Why in the heck, would they try to get ppl to buy a c-d with 3 songs on it. let alone, you only need to get hybrid theory and meteora for the total amount of songs they have done! why waste the money???"
1,It's bad quality,"I bought these dvd's expecting them to be good quality recordings of bad quality films. Instead, I got bad quality recordings period.They seem to be compressed like vcd pirate copies, and every now and again the company's insignia logo comes up at the bottom right hand of the screen for about 30 seconds or so.I was disappointed with the vcd-like quality, and annoyed to be assaulted with logos during the films in this way.Don't buy it."
2,Got my interest,"Like Schindler's story, Giardina's novel introduces to us a story that some of us may never have known before. This novel introduced me to a real figure who is very inspiring and very human. Too many historic ""heroes"" seem like myths or memories. Giardina cures this illness by making Bonhoeffer real, and making him exist once again. It is both an important and well told story, based on something terrifying and real. This is the novel that developed my interest in Bonhoeffer and his life.Giardina teaches at West Virginia State College, the school that I attend. I have had the opportunity to take her Fiction Writing Workshop class. A friend recommened this novel to me. It remains my favorite Giardina novel. Serious, but entertaining. Touching and compassionate. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read."
2,C S LEWIS,I LOVE ALL THE C S LEWIS BOOKS AND MOVIES. I ALSO GO TO THE THEATER TO SEE THEM.. GREAT!!!!!
2,The Best Grammar Book,"I taught writing to law students for six years and searched for the best grammar book available. Ed Good's is easy to read and follow (a high schooler can follow it), and is comprehensive to the point that even I learned things I had not known. As I tell my students, grammar is the clothing in which you dress your ideas. Just as you wouldn't go to an interview dressed in ripped jeans and a t-shirt, you shouldn't dress your writing in sloppy grammar that distracts from your ideas. This book is the equivalent of a bespoke tailor. If you need grammar help, get it."
2,A Real Treat,"Everyone should read through this fascinating review of the many documented and undocumented trans-Atlantic crossings prior to 1492. It puts our ""school-book"" history in perspective. Very easy and interesting accounts of each of these crossings."
1,worst online purchase ever!!,"I bought 2 of this item from these guys for my kids laptops. One of them came defective and I reqested a full refund for both beacuse they said that according to Amazon policy I had to pay shipping cost for returned items. It has been almost a month sending emails back and forth and I still haven't seen my refund back yet. Needless to say, my kids are still unable to use their laptops and I am extremely unhappy with these guys. I will NEVER buy from them again."
2,Antuan and Ray Ray Fine As Eva,"They cool and man are they fine and they're other song""feelin' it"" is also real tight I love them can't wait to they make a cd!"""
1,Save your money and go diving.,"Divemaster gets drunk here. Divemaster gets drunk there. Divemaster gets laid. Divemaster makes fun of fat people.That's pretty much it. This collection of anecdotal stories has little if any point, and goes nowhere. Rather than the travelogue of interesting dive locales it claims to be, Rapture Of The Deep is little more than the kind of macho posturing you can find in any bar near any decent dive operator, but less interesting.You won't find idea for dive trips, and you won't find useful insights about diving or divers. If you feel you must read this, at least buy one of the used copies, as I guarantee they've never been read more than once."
2,My mother loved it,My mother likes big number pads and she uses the memory features when they are easy to understand. The phone has 2 prominent memory buttons in addition to the others and I put in my cell number and my sister's and she loves it. People over 65 will use technology if it is well designed. She's very happy with it.
1,sad,"I have been reading Sci-Fi, (Battletech in general) for many years. And, I think that this is the poorest example of Battletech writing since 'FAR COUNTRY' which i don't consider a Battletech novel at all."
2,A new Femi fan!,"I had never seen or heard of Femi Kuti until recently when he performed at the World Music Awards. His amazing performance of ""Beng Beng Beng"" was the highlight of the event! I was drawn to the amazing rhythmic afro beats in the instrumental aspects of his music and the sensuality in his voice. I bought this CD because of it and am truly impressed with it. ""Shoki Shoki has several great tracks besides the above mentioned including, ""Truth Don Die"" and ""Eregele"". Femi's music is filled with so much energy that it's hard to stay still when listening to it."
2,FREE DOWNLOAD OF THIS BOOK,Great book! You can download this book for free in PDF.Just google JDK101 and click on FREE STUFF and look for it with other legal free books you can download also.You can also google or go to SCRIBD and put in Edwin L.Haislet or Boxing by Edwin Haislet in their Searh Engine and there are legal free downloads of this book also
2,Super fun but not too durable,"This Diego Rescue Center is very fun for my kids to play with. My 2 1/2 and 4 year old love it. They play rescue adventures and I love the imaginative play that comes with this house. The only problem I have is that it's not very durable. It's wobbles on it's ""stilts"" that attach it to the base and the top floor (the part that folds out) falls off all the time. I probably have to put it on 5 times everytime they play with it. I really don't think they are being too rough - they just lean on the floor while they are playing with it and it pops off. I'm afraid it will eventually break - it's held on with only 2 tabs - and with the constant popping off I'm sure one or both of the tabs will eventually give.Overall, I think it's a fun toy with lots of replay value. But I wish it was a bit more kid-friendly on the durability side - especially for the money."
2,Stuff I never even thought about...,"Grew up as the atonal curmudgeon in a thoroughly musical household -- my mother got her BA in music at age 70 and still teaches piano at age 80 -- but Carhart walks one through the ""quartier musique"" in such a fashion that even I thoroughly enjoyed the stroll. His rediscovery of the piano begins with his own story but fear not, the book moves briskly away from the personal and captures the reader's attention and interest as Carhart writes of the wonderful complexity of this commonplace thing: the piano. The descriptions of the master classes and the visit to the Fazioli piano factory are brilliant concluding pieces to this very well-crafted volume. In essence the book embodies much of what Carhart has to tell us about the piano. As well he treats Paris and the French with due consideration and appreciation and never condescends to his reader. A delightful read that gains momentum."
2,Works like a charm,"I have 2 cairn terriers and this works great to keep the hair quanity down in the house. They do look like they have been groomed especially the wheaten one. The Brindle we have looks a little less groomed, I guess since her hair is just more wiry. It's made such a difference in appreciating their hair coat."
2,Action packed. A must for Han Solo fans.,"This book was beautiflly writen. i want Han and Bria get together soooooooo bad, and they finnlly did. this book was great, the best of all three."
2,Great value for money,"I received this walkman for my twelfth birthday and since then I've been using it non-stop. The G-protection is incredible. I wear it when cycling, running and when I practise gymnastics, I've shaken it, dropped it on the floor, even out a window and it doesn't skip at all. Battery life is good and the sound quality is excellent. The player itself is lightweight, attractive and easy to use. The Remote is a great feature and means I don't have to keep getting it out of my bag when I want to change tracks or adjust the volume. There are a wide range of volume settings: I prefer my music fairly quiet and always keep the AVLS switched on. The headphones I swapped for some of my own: the originals were cheap looking, uncomfortable to wear and I prefer the small, in-ear design. However, this is a small drawback and the CD player's other features make it a product that is great value for money. I never regretted choosing this Walkman, and I would recommend it to anyone else.~Jenna~"
1,MIssing Parts,"I wouldn't know if I like this bed or not. I ordered it over a month ago and still don't have it set up. Our son was really looking forward to using his ""big boy bed"", however it has been a nightmare so far. We received the package, and opened it, finding no hardware or instructions. I called the manufacturer and they said they would sent them to me. Two weeks later we get hardware and instructions and sit again to assemble. We find out we are missing all of the support slats for the bottom. I call the manufacturer again. Three weeks later the slats come, so we sit down again to put it together. So page 3 and 4 are missing from the instructions ... we figure it out. Guess what? There are 2 screws/bolts missing. Still in a crib."
2,Who was Jason Zacharias?,"That riddle was the key to Noel Emery's frightening predicament. Ever since she'd arrived in Britain, she'd been plunged into chaos, pursued by assasins. And her guardian angel was a seasoned veteran of murder....and a man who claimed to be her husband.Had Noel once shared lovers' caresses with the dark, dangerous Jason Zacharias? Or was the straining sensuality between them just an illusion? The answer was locked in the best of all hiding places - her mind. A mind that now scrambled fantasy and memory.Noel's only way out of the maelstorm was to trust her heart - and her life - to a man who pretended to be a protector but who looked every inch a predator."
1,gets worse and worse,"The first time I bought J-14 was in 2010. From there to now it has gotten from good to horrible! Seriously the stories are very shallow, they focus on crushes and celebrities . They are boring and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Catty and only marginally interesting,"Cat fights set up like Joan Collins versus Linda Evans, brief cultural references, and then back to more back-biting plotting and night time soap stock plots. Two stars only because of some of the facts gleaned. A huge disappointment."
2,What A Book!,"This book is SOO timely; not necessarily because of the boy meet girl theme, but because in this book, someone dies and it sobers you; Just this year alone for me, I have known seven people to die. Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real."
2,A good read !,"Definitely a good read. This book provides detailed insight into the planning of covert operations in Afghanistan, and some of the problems associated with dealing with the indigenous population of that region. The book is not centered around actual battles fought, but focuses on the day to day aspects of the operation. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with an interest in special forces operations."
1,Well...,"Well, the game's graphics are ok, but I think that the creators could have used satellite imaging to make real buildings. Outside of the big cities the buildings are the same. And there is no storyline or objectives, so if you want to be bored for half an hour, play this game."
2,Great Guide,"This guide to Rayman 2 is everything that you will need to be able to complete the game. This guide will tell you where to find every lum, every bonus and all of the cages. There are detailed maps telling you the location of everything that you need including the masks. This will make the game easy for you but if you can do it without the guide then i would recommend that you do that as you will have more satisfaction in yourself for being able to defeat it without any help. (if not buy this guide)"
2,Excellent product... it your cat is normal.,"This is a wonderful product. It runs quietly, is easy to fill, and most cats will think it's great since it keeps the water tasting fresh.That being said, it did not work out for my cat, who, in all fairness, is not the sharpest tool in the shed. While most cats will happily drink from the Catit by licking the dome, our cat attacked it on several occasions, beating it with his paws and eventually popping the dome right out of its frame.I bought this product based on rave reviews from friends who have been using it for many months and in hopes of finding a method to water my cat without all the water ending up on my kitchen floor (he likes to empty all water bowls in the house by batting the water out with his paws). If you have a weird, water-batting cat, this may not work for you. If you have a normal cat, you (and your cat) will love it."
2,doggy doors,"EVERYbody with a pet should have a doggy door. What a way to go :o). The only thing I wish is that it looked the same on both sides. The person who put mine in put a frame around the other side, doesn't look so good. It's in the garage though, so that's okay."
2,works very well,I got this quickly and it worked very well i used it to fix my xbox 360 and this worked like a charm
2,Great sewing book,This is a very good book for some one who is just learning this skill. Also lots of more advance techniques.Only problem is it could have better illustrations.
2,Awesome movie,this is a pretty good movie. Bradley Cooper does an extremley good job at his role. this movie is really good. the actors and the story are awesome. one of the best movies i've seen this year. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
2,One of my favourite books,"It is simply fantastic. Fosnes Hansen has a unique gift: We live these musicians lives, and make us feel like we have lost old friens when they die. I also loved his newest book (not yet translated, but you really should buy it if you liked this one!!!)"
2,Illuminating and Informative,"This book is excellent for anyone with a serious interest in Chinese religions. It traces the development of Chinese mystical thought and practice from the earliest mystical and philosophical writings up through the Tang dynasty. In addition to its appeal to the scholarly community, anyone who has read and enjoyed some of the works of Chinese mysticism will find that this book provides a background in which to better understand what they have already read as well as exposing them to works they are not yet familiar with. All in all an excellent read."
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is utter garbage. The acting, the dialog, all of it is horrible. I am going to give this movie away to the first sucker I see. Do not waste your time and especially don't waste your money on this trash."
2,"if you are an engineer, Buy It !","Really an amazing collection. Yes, it is technical---but I think the book can satisfy a varied number of people, on a lot of levels. Whether to understand how microphones work, or work better---to know how better to use microphones--or just interested in microphone history, this book is a rare find."
2,Slavery By Another Name,Excellent documentary! I was surprised. It is not kind of information you get in school. I highly recommend this DVD.
1,do NOT buy this movie if you love animals,"While there is some ""campy"" value in seeing Frankie Avalon in a safari pic .... the failings far out weigh any other value the film may have.This pic includes some actual footage shot in Africa, and the rules about filming animals were much different then. This film contains actual footage of an Elephant being shot in the head and killed.Do NOT buy this movie if you like animals. The scenes will stay with you. Very disturbing."
2,Glittery Goodness,"Just listen to Glitter On a couple times. It's one of those melodies that doesn't sound so much invented as discovered, like a diamond underground, waiting to be unearthed. The rest of the album is nearly that good, even when the song lasts for like nine billion minutes (I Should Be That Guy). And Lincoln Town Car features this astonishing bit of lyric poetry, which manages to be vague, explicit, lurid, and almost innocent, all at the same time: ""Your tongue was sweet / You legs were strong / I'm wasted out my head."" This is music for people who like songs, singing, guitars, and drums."
2,The Ipod Killer,"No need to write a long review. This is the best hard drive MP3 player you can buy AND, at the current Amazon price, it is now also competitively priced. Add it to your cart and check-out, you won't regret it."
1,"Unhappy, product had expired - could not use","I ordered Microsoft Home and Student 2007. When I recevied it and tried to use it it would not work. In looking at some of the files I found that this Copy was no longer valid after October 26, 2009. I could never even get up the screen to put in the registeration key. I needed this software very badly to prepare resumes because I am unemployed. Now I don't have what I need and will have to wait for my refund before I can purchase a valid copy. Please be very careful of any software you purchase from this seller.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
2,Scrutinizing the science,"With the mixed messages parents are getting on the issue of media violence and aggression, this book serves as an educative tool. We are usually treated to misleading sound-bites and talking points regarding the ""scientific studies"" the author evaluates. Like all science, these studies are not safe from scrutiny. There have been many poorly designed studies in this area and the author calls attention to them. I am dumbfounded by previous reviewers attempt to accuse this psychologist as someone trying to undermine psychology. For scientists: questioning one and anothers' research methods is part of the profession. This is how knowledge advances. The only insults to common sense I see are the studies that attempt to define aggressive behavior as popping a balloon, or thinking about violence after seeing violent movies.Good science can and should stand up to scrutiny. The fact is, psychology has been guilty of some bad science."
1,Westbend broke after 7 months of very light use.,"I am upset. The circular cutting wheel and washers fell off the main shaft, making this now useless! We barely used it, perhaps opening about 3-4 cans a week over 7 months. And I bought this only because I read so many great reviews--that said, did we get the one lemon in the batch? At $25, I expect more than 7 months of use--and I see the price is now up to $33. If anyone has a suggestion as to whether parts are available, kindly respond. This is very disappointing."
1,Kid Vengeance,"The movie has a good story; however, the quality of the DVD is not good. It looks like it was recorded from a bad VHS. I was disappointed that the seller does not inform the buyer that the DVD is not digitally remastered. Unless you like poor quality DVDs with no chapter list, do not waste your money on this DVD."
2,prose from a great literary figure,"A good selection of prose from T. S. Eliot. After years of reading, I still find his prose more effective and more useful than his poetry. (I know -- sheer heresy.) Eliot places great emphasis on The Tradition and on an impersonal approach to art, an emphasis which aspiring writers of today would be wise to heed. Like Matthew Arnold, Eliot's criticism is dogmatic, and right. The reader's only wish is that this collection included more."
2,Rod Stewart Balladeers again!,"Rod just can't resist it. Since he's into power ballads, Rock has left him for good. Long gone have the days wherein Rod screamed about Hot legs or Tora! Tora! Tora! Out with the Boys. Nowadays he has settled down (new wife and probably new kids underway?) and that suits him just fine. He has discovered that not all artists have to be like Mick and Keith -who will probably die Rockin'- and the style he has committed to is just right. This album definitly proves him right. The fact that he has not contributed any song to this album says something about the man. He has found out that he is not a songwriter, just the singer. No less and no more but at the same time Rod proves why he his right not songwriting: His voice-impact is stronger than ever!! Ballad after ballad brings tears to my eyes; Tears of joy! Sam and Otis have finally found the singer that -like the three tenors- will be remembered for their terrific singing! Hats off mr. Stewart!"
2,Happy we were able to get in a narrow size.,We have ordered a pair of these shoes from Amazon three times before and have been happy with their durability. This time we were able to get these in a narrow fit which have been perfect for our tall yet very thin daughter. Again we feel this was a great buy.
2,"Great choice of guitar players, choice of licks disappointing","This book as others of Dave Rubin covers some great ""unsung"" guitar players contains essays and biograpic data and also some rare photos - in many cases material i have not found anywhere else. Thats why i as a fan and also collector of books about my favourite music dont regret buying.Unfortunately the choice of the material that is tabbed out is somewhat disappointing. Very short, about three pages or less on each player and IMO not really essential licks but rather mediocre.A wasted chance to make a great book."
2,Explains what you need to know,"Can you copy that pretty picture or graphic that you saw online to use for your personal website or brochure?That's the question that I face every day because I do quite a bit of professional work with graphics.I don't have time or money to have a professional copyright lawyer on my staff to help me decypher when I'm using a graphic legally. This has led to me always buying exclusive licenses or nonexclusive licenses for virtually every graphic that I use but this adds a ton of costs to any production project.This work opens up the public domain to me so that I have a thorough understanding of what's legal to use from public domain information and what is not. I love this work, it's written clearly and plainly and with it really helps me understand this important realm (public domain).It really helps me respect the rights of others while at the same time allowing me to open up the world to low cost content options."
1,"Newt? You're kidding, right?","All I need do to rate this book (I didn't say I didn't open it) is to read that Newt considers one of the prime problems with America is the lack of GOD.When Newt owns up to his own shallowness and lack of integrity, then I might be able to listen to him preach about God. Then again, maybe not.Newt displayed his own sense of Godliness, righteousness and holiness when he walked out on his cancer-stricken wife. What a guy! I mean it. But would I spend 50 cents on a book he wrote?Probably not."
2,WE LIKE IT,"My husband and I have bought two of the DVD players and are very happy with them. There has been no noticable noise, fire, or refusal to let the CD go. The remote is not quite a &quot;joke&quot; but it's not the best. It's a cheap DVD player and we feel it's worth the price and more."
2,Eric Darius Shines,"I recently purchased the debut CD by Eric Darius, and it is great! I had the pleasure of being able to hear Eric play a few times in church in Sarasota, Florida before he was known, and loved his music immediately. He knows his way around the sax, and he is a hard worker when he performs. I hope he has a long and profitable career. You can't miss with this CD."
2,Torchwood season two,"Torchwood is awesome, however it would have been really nice if Amazon could have posted me a version that i could actually watch on Australian dvd players, considering it was being shipped to Australia and all..."
1,The Descendants DVD,I bought this on the recommendation of my cousin. I wish I had listened to my own instincts and saved the money.
1,aren't we smart?,"This is a glib romp through difficult terrain. The authors seem to answer lots of questions, but after a while their answers become predictable and increasingly superficial. No problem is so tough that they can't solve. No doubt is so deep that they can't dispel. They write as if they are the C. S. Lewis of the 21st Century. They aren't."
2,Nice reading,"It ended before that last pages of the book cause there is some reference stuff back there. It was an interesting book. But I found problems. In the inside-cover, there is a illustration of the floor plan. But that floor plan does not match the outside of the house!?! Which is wrong? I would also like to see more real pictures in it."
1,Didn't Identify With Characters,I need someone in a show that I care what happens to them. Didn't like any of the principal characters. Wouldn't have really cared if everyone got chopped up.
1,No light in this Book for Flash,"The Book: Much more (and this is no joke) could be learned from the well designed demo tutorial which comes with the Flash 3.0 program. This book is just an expensive reiteration of what you get for free with the program.The CD: On a Macintosh level, there are only demo programs which you could download from Macromedia.com for free. Occasionally, the book would ask you to import a certain file that's to be used w/the tutorial and *NOT ONE* was present in the CD. - go figure!Overall: I believe that the authors should first read through the tutorials that Macromedia provides and then publish something that would actually be better."
1,Reviews,"I still havn't recieved it yet, and it said it will come by january 22nd. Hopefully i will recieve it in the next few days."
2,DBZ Budokai 2 is da bomb!!!!,"Dragonball Z budokai2 is awesome. They have way better moves, fusions, potara, and characters. You can now get Majin Buu Super Buu and Kid Buu. It is AWESOME game and u should get it!"
1,Brian Yuzna should have steered clear,Brian Yuzna should have avoided being associated in any way with this waste of celluloid.
2,Still using after 8 years,I got this bag when my oldest son was born. I love it because I have always traveled light and I hate bulky bags. I got the black/graphite color so my husband won't carrying. This bag has survived two kids and my youngest is now 4 1/2 years old. And it still looks great. I still use it as a purse and for outings. People always ask me where I got such a cool bag!
1,These are the small gumballs ...,"Be aware these gumballs are the small ones. Half of the machines Amazon has matched to them are for the large gumballs.'TheNewMall' that sells these is aware of this fact, but will not issue a return once you order them.Until Amazon fixes the problem and finds a more honest vendor, be aware of what your getting.At the current price, even if your looking for the small ones, your not getting much for your money."
2,"Pricey, but worth it","If you have a Honeywell electronic air filter that uses these, it is worth replacing them once or twice a year. I vacuum them occasionally in between."
1,Not so good..........,I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like. All I know Is I've stoped.The novel and Movie is really good!BATTLE ROYALE 2 was not that good.Later.........
1,II only wish the whole CD was as good as the 1st 3 songs!,"I bought the CD after hearing ""Barely Breathing"". I couldn't believe how wonderful it was during the first three songs and was making a mental note of the number of CDs that I was going to buy to give to friends to share his great work. Then..... the rest of the CD played. It put me to sleep and I was emarrassed that I was going to buy this to hand out to people. I am very hopeful but hesistant about ""Humming."" And I thought I had found my replaement for Toad the Wet Sprocket. I hope the next CD has a lot more spunk."
1,Beware,I was fairly happy with the unit until it refused to copy files from my Kingston Elite Pro (50x) SD card. Their tech support blamed the card that it used outdated technology and I needed 80x or faster card. They should probably put correct information on their product page about which cards actually work with this unit. I do not appreciate being misled.
1,"You, sir are the dufus.",I don't know. I don't get it. I would strongly encourage you to spend your pennies on something else.
2,unbelievable,this album has such a fresh sound.it's good to hear people are still making great music.would recommend it to everyone
2,Pure joy,"If you are a science fiction fan, then this book is among the best there is. period. The quality of the book, its characters, classic setup and clean science all make this a pure joy to read.The plot is the age old story of colony-fighting-for-independence-from-its-mother-country except that the colony literally stones the enemy to independent!The author uses a specific style of writing (mix of English slang with Russian mix) that unsettles you a bit early on, but actually becomes very much a part of the theme.Mike (our co-protagonist) even surpasses HAL (2001 Space odyssey) in terms of character depth. The part where ""s/he""tries to think up jokes is really hilarious :)Just pure joy."
1,aunt bam's place,This movie was scary and I did not like it. Do better on this because it was not the best
2,At the Top of His Game,"Roberto Carlos is truly an amazing artist and singer. This is an MTV acoustic/live recording album in which Roberto sings 14 of his most memorable hits of his entire career. It is unquestionably his best work in a long time and one of his best CDs ever! The musicians are top notch, the crowd is enthusiastic, and Roberto's vocal performance is nothing short than stellar. This is a must have for those that are familiar with RC's career. There is no doubt that you'll love it."
1,"""I Spy"" in Name Only","Once again, a classic TV series receives shoddy Hollywood treatment. ""I Spy"" (2002) takes the show's name and trashes everything that made it memorable. Failing to click as a team, Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson never display the smooth rapport associated with Bill Cosby and Robert Culp. Meanwhile, director Betty Thomas struggles through depressingly routine material. Avoid this fiasco and track down the 1965-68 episodes (which the screenwriters never bothered to see)."
2,Strong xmas film,"If you enjoy films with Reese Witherspoon, then you should buy this and watch it ASAP. She shines in this movie. Well done!"
2,Libby 4 1/2 Ounce Spice jar with lid,"I LOVE these jars! I read other reviews and some of the info wasn't quite accurate. First of all, the full McCormick spices do fit in these jars, but just tap them a bit. No big deal. Secondly, to remove the stickers, just open the box from the bottom to expose the label, squirt with a bit of Windex, let sit for a few minutes and the labels rub right off. They seal nicely. My only gripe is that labeling the front of the jar doesn't work because of the curve. Avery makes label 22825 that fits PERFECTLY on the top of the jar, which worked well for me. I have my entire set of 48 displayed on a tiered shelf in my kitchen and they look amazing. In my opinion, these are the best I have ever found, and I have been looking a long, long time. There are others that cost a ton more money, but for the price they are perfect."
1,garbage,The author should be ashamed of himself for writing such misleading information...especially to parents who are in such a vulnerable state. Please consult a real doctor before spending and funding this Author. BY buying this you are only opening more doors to this type of quackery.
2,Andis hang up dryer,"Excellent. Combines all the elements that you could possibley want in one. Ionic, Quiet design, compact wall mount, built in night light. I'd buy it again. Can't be found in the usual stores."
1,a marketing ploy,"In short, do not buy this movie. We got it since it seemed similar to Tinkerbell, which our 4 year old loves (and we do too), and because of the Thumbelina name. But ever since purchasing this movie, my 4-year old daughter is walking around the house imitating the words and tone of the rich kid snobs in this movie. We are very careful in teaching our daughter to use nice words and to speak in a kind manner. I winced every time I heard the dialogue - including a few choice phrases by Thumbelina.It is a total rip-off of the Thumbelina name. This movie is already in the donation pile."
1,101 trees of indiana,"Too technical , does not use the commen names , does not show the limb paterns of tress , a booklet from Perdue will give more useful info for the person in the woods."
2,Excellent deal for multi-region,"Two minutes after plugging it in I was watching my region 2 DVDs. The price is great, but I haven't explored any other features yet. I bought it ONLY because I have region 2 DVDs and can't play them anywhere. If this only gives me this functionality, I'll be thrilled. If I get more out of this machine, I'll be THRILLED!"
1,"ok, flimsy, doesnt fit quite right","This product is a little flimsy and doesn't fit quite right under the sink. I think it's a little too bulky for something that is supposed to increase storage. Works ok, but is too much of a hassle to return."
1,Not Funny,"""Uses for a Dead Cat is NOT funny and promotes cruelty to cats. If you buy this or think its funny you need your 'head examined'.c"
2,They work,"I was hessitant at first but was desperate to protect my furniture, I gave them a shot. They absolutely work. Just make sure to clip claws before applying them and make sure get the right size. I got large when I really should have gotten medium. They still works but I had to clip part of them to work. Now with the. Right size they are perfect. So far 5weeks and only a few have fallen off my 2 cats"
1,Wow... Such an original plot....,"A poor, defenseless Chinese woman immigrates to L.A.'s Chinatown to seek a better life, but faces oppression from those around her (Asian Americans), until she is ""rescued"" by her (white) ""knight in shining armor.""If you enjoy movies which stereotype an entire group of people, then you should buy this.<sarcasm>"
1,This Game is Horrible,"If you are looking for a cheep but okay DS racing game, stay away from this game. For anyone, buying this game is practically burning money. It's that bad. It is probably the easiest game I've bought."
2,"Not sure that it does what it says, but my boyfriend likes it.","I use this stuff mostly for the scent. It has a very pleasant, soft scent that enhances my regular perfume. My boyfriend really likes it, but I think it's mainly for the scent, not because of some attractant power. I don't get hit on more or anything.I've read that Pherlure and Athena both really do work if you are looking for something effective. They are both more pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,a disgrace,"This is far from a railfan video. It celebrates a very dark period in New York Subway history,the late 1970's early 1980's when the thugs and vandals too over. It celebrates graffiti, which in reality is blatant vandalism. Thankfully you can visit New York today and ride subway trains virtually graffiti free, and see them for what they are, a true work of art."
2,Incredible Digicam Bag,"If you are looking for a camera bag, this one is it! We got ours nice and cheap at amazon.com. It has separate hand and shoulder straps, several interior pouches, including two that are set up to store 4 AA batteries. It offers plenty of protection so that stuff doesn't spill out--the bag's cover is fastened with a velcro strap, and over this you can fasten a buckle that adds a second layer of protection. The main inside compartment (where you will store the digicam) comes with a moveable/removeable boundary that you can adjust so that however wide your digicam is, it will not bounce around. These guys thought of everything! This bag is well built, with what looks like very strong, water-resistant materials, and should last a very long time!"
1,Present,I was very dissappointed. Bought as a present for an older relative. Letters/numbers too small--programming too difficult.
1,Boring conflict,"I read the description for this - dragons, vampires, Atlantis - and I was hooked into buying it. I'm sorry I did.The hero is a guardian of Atlantis; the heroine is a human wondering around trying to find her brother. She stumbles into Atlantis, meets the hero, love at first sight, but! He's got to kill her because she found out the secret that Atlantis exists.That's the conflict - he's got to do his duty and protect the secret. But I know that since it is a romance novel, he's not going to do it. The hero killing the heroine doesn't scream happy ending. The plot goes on and on, his dueling emotions drag out until I want to smack him. Then finally, three quarters the way through the book, he decides he can't do it. What a shocker, let me tell you.The worldbuilding, the setting, the imaginative story were all wonderful. The conflict between the hero and the heroine ruined all that."
1,"Negative, one-sided, unforgiving","Noble provides a wealth of information about good nutrition, birthing practices, and the risks of multiple pregnancy. The problem is that the factual evidence is smothered in a heavy handed, one-sided viewpoint that seems to originate from the fascist regime of down-with-all-modern-medicine. This is my second pregnancy, and I recently found out that I'm carrying twins. I was interested in the possibility of a vagnial birth with minimal intervention, but I'm more shaken than encouraged by Noble's stance on the evils of c-sections and other possible complications. This book was NOT the one I needed to help me discern what was best in the upcoming months.The nutrition information had a solid core, but Noble pushed the envelope with her own agenda of anti-dairy pro-vegan diets. This would have been much better received and better understood had it less of a screaming banshee tone.Good luck, and you might want to find a different book."
2,beautiful & affordable! WOW!!!,I got these to match the curtain rod - and both items are exceptional in quality and beauty. It's refreshing to find quality made items at a reasonable price.
1,"Horrible, manipulative, does damage to the cause of Christ","This book, along with anything else written by C.S. Lovett, is a terrible, evil example of evangelism. The author cites specific techniques to manipulate people into making a serious decision. The ""evangelist"" walks away thinking he's done good for the Kingdom. The ""convert"" walks away feeling bruised, bullied, confused, and glad it's over. This is a great technique if you want numbers. It is a horrible technique if you want changed lives. There is no magic prayer that makes you a Christian. Repeating some words because somebody put their hands on your shoulder and said, ""Repeat after me. Lord... I'm... a sinner...,"" doesn't make me a Christian any more than reading Marx outloud makes me a communist."
2,Handy addition to yard work,Has worked very well around the yard. It could be a little wider at the handle for my large frame.
1,Nice Try...Move On,"Please don't waste your money. This CD, though an admirable effort by a vocally talented artist, is one of the worst attempts at a breakout album ever recorded. The simple lyrics and dated, electronic sound might pull some weight overseas, but the good ol' U.S. of A. will not embrace mediocre writing spliced with poorly synthesized accompaniment. ""Just close your eyes and count to two/dive on in just me and you""??? Who counts to TWO? Why not ""Just close your eyes and count to three/dive on in just you and me""? And who can overlook the cheesy phone conversation played at the beginning of one of the songs? Come on, Mr. Thomas, we know you can sing. Now prove that you can write."
1,Nintendo DS Lite Adapter,"This paticular DS Lite power adapter is quite frankly garbage. Yes it charges the DS Lite, but it also creates feed back noise in the speakers and a line runs from bottom to top on the screen. The Picture representing the item wass that of a Nintendo Certified Product. This is not what I recived...Also the cord is really really short only about half as long as the one that came with my DS Lite. Very dissatisfied with this product. I won't return it because the shipping is possibly more than what I paid for it."
1,Disappointing and Over Produced,"There was not much to impress on this album. If you're a Rafferty fan, then this should be the last album to buy in your research or listening enjoyment on the musician. Track after track is rife with over production traits like heavy drum machines, and keyboard/synthesizer riffs. The only standout was the hard rocker ""Does He Know What He's Taken On"" A solid song is ""The Light of Love"" but that's only because it's a soft tune sans the hard over-bearing drum machine. Throughout the album are the typical pessimistic views of the rock industry as a whole. This is especially clear on the opening track ""Time's Caught Up On You"". The low price on the album is the best thing about the work, so if you do choose to get this one, just chalk the seven dollar loss up to a venture."
1,Good night light but comes stays on all the time,"We ordered these for my son's nursery hoping it would come on at night & go off during the day, but it ends up just staying on all the time. It is also not very bright, just enough that I can see where I am going, but not enough that I can nurse him by that light alone."
1,This is silly.,"Mad About You is a fine tv programme... I'm English and happened to catch an episode on freeview by accident and was completely hooked by the sharp script, witty set-ups and general easy raport between the two fantastic leads, Helen Hunt and the fantastic Paul Reiser.It shows how great the show is that I am willing to wade through this unfamiliar American website to see if I can buy all the series... and I am appalled by this so-called ""Best Of"". There seems to be very little in the way of extras on the first two releases, and I refuse to be conned by the studio into shelling out the extra cash for this.It's almost as though the studio is using the love dedicated fans of Mad About You feel for the programme. Shame on you!"
2,harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban,I like the book Harry Potter cause I like wizard cause have power. Harry is a powerful wizard and smart and quick at fling.Harry is a good but he has lots of problems and even Harry has learn all the things and he a good person.
1,Not the same,"Wife is saying that the product is not the same since they changed the packaging and ingredients. She has extremely curly hair and is complaining that it ""doesn't hold the way it used to"""
2,Excellent resource for teaching and research,"Great stuff. McIver neatly reviews anti-evolution (in the broadest sense) before and after Darwin. Thought provoking in that is shows the mental tricks critics will turn to avoid contradicting the Genesis account and agreeing with Darwin.It's a shame the revised edition wasn't updated. Still, highly useful.As an aside, it's highly unlikely that the comment above attributed to McIver is true. McIver comes across as one who _always_ belived in evolution (see, for example, his articles in ""Creation/Evolution"" and ""Skeptic"") ... methinks I smell a hoax."
1,Useful as a doorstop,"John Hodgman is an accomplished writer and has good comedic sense and timing, so why did he release this truly awful book? I'd accuse the editor of malpractice, but there is no evidence an editor was ever involved. Maybe the joke is on us, the people who foolishly purchased this wad of paper and ink. My only consolation is I bought the paperback."
1,Christian fundamentalism!,"This is NOT a book that someone should care to read, that is, unless you are a cynical fundamentalist Christian who believes that whatever is not ""good Christian values"" is the sign of the Devil. There are plenty of better books out there that deals with religious perspectives on UFOs in general and extraterrestrials in particular.Dailey believes that ALL occult and New Age movements have one thing in common; destroy Christianity. No wonder people turn their backs on a religion that refuses to accept other values. It is not an investigative book, but rather a Christian manifesto filled with Bible citations and cynical ideas.People shouldn't talk about Satanism unless they know what they're talking about, and Dailey clearly does not. Don't bother buying it."
1,It's the History Channel so of course it has a conservative slant.,"Definitely a top down 'Great Man Theory' production without any real information on how normal, average people like you or me lived. After all, it is 'The Story of US', right? Or supposed to be. In short, expect more bland stories about Lincoln etc. fitting for an elementary school aged child than any real meaty discussion of 'The Story of Us'.This kind of streamlined storyline that accentuates the leaders seems oddly conservative to me.Maybe not."
2,Really nice,"This is just a lovely jacket, it is nice when its heat, it is nice when its cold. I think if it ever comes in black I definately will buy it. Also it is a fair price"
2,A Claustrophobic Depiction of the Life of U-Boat Submariners,Madness drips like salty water squeezed from the creaking seams of the U-Boat death traps this gripping narrative describes in all-too vivid detail. The author takes you where few can imagine going...and lets you feel the crushing hammers of depth charges and the suffocating terror of impending death. If you want a glimpse into the reality of U-Boat life...or the insanity of war...this is the book. I couldn't put it down.
1,Not what I thought I was getting,I don't think there is anything wrong with the product. But I thought I was just buying Couscous I didn't know there were different types also there were NO instructions how to cook It.
1,This Stunk,"Sam Yeager - the truly despicable Quisling wife stealer in the first series, is now the main character. To my great disappointment, he has not been executed for treason, as he deserves.Instead of dealing with the alien invaders the way would really would have as soon as we gained a technological advantage (attack and complete subjugation of all survivors), Turtledove has us all trying to get along for some reason. The result is an utterly boring novel. I kept waiting for the shooting to start. It never does so don't bother reading this dreck."
1,What the heck!,"Okay? I see a lot of great reviews for this game. Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game. I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics! then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive. Plus people say how shinobi looks cool???? I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while. And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics. Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2. This game really blows! It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone. Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short! The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it! Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it. Trust me!"
2,Proof you don't need a fancy gym to work out,"This book should be taught in schools. I have learned things from it I never thought possible, and really enjoyed it.This is a true ""low cost"" type workout book, it really focuses on solid workouts to build strength and burn fat, but doesn't rely on expensive machines or equipment to do so. Most of these things can be done easily in your own home!It really focuses on ""adult"" schedules and I like that. When you're juggling a job, family and who knows what else you dont have a lot of time and that is the focus of the book.The author knows the subject well, and it shows. It also focuses on hard work, not fluff or BS. This is not a ""get skinny quick"" scam book by any means. The author is very honest about what you need to do.I'll definitely be coming back to this book and getting even more serious about it. It's worth the price for sure!"
1,stop the bickering and follow the rules!,"This Colonial House was my least favorite of all the House series. The volunteers were not well chosen because they belly ached and refused to make it an authentic experience. Some did not play by the time period rules--very aggervating. I would love to be a part of these experiments and I can't stand when someone wastes the opportunity.While still a fascinating series, I wasn't drawn in like some of the other House series because of the constant conflict."
1,Embarrassed!,"I once read that Grishom said he would never write anything that would embarrass his children or his mother. Well, I bet his whole family is red-faced now. The Brethren took us on such a twisted, depraved path that I stopped after 100 pages convinced I could find more edifying material to fill my mind! This was such a disappointment following The Testament which offered hope to the weary and worn-out. John, you must have had a terrible year. Don't leave us with this trash...you owe it to your self and to us."
2,Good Camera for a Business Traveler,"I bought the Fujifilm Finepix A500 as a camera to pack in my PC case on business travel. I use it mainly to get candid snapshots in business meetings and conferences. It is small, discrete, and works well for the purpose intended. The 5MP resolution allows me to get quick shots without much care for composition, background clutter, etc. since I use a photo editor to take care of those tasks later-on. When buying this camera note that it does not have a case or much on-board storage. An XD memory card and a case are necessary. I also recommend getting a NiMH battery charger to keep battery replacement costs low."
1,So disapointed,My son received this as a gift and it took 2 adults and glue to put it together! Totally defeats the purpose of having this toy. We found it would not stay together without the glue. The lightest touch would cause the entire thing to collapse. If he hadn't seen the toy out of the box we would have thrown it out or returned it. With all of the initial positive reviews I seriously wonder if there has been a recent redesign from the initial product. Quality of this product is terrible.
1,Poorly bound history book,"The history is nice, but that's something the professor should be interjecting. Also, this book is poorly manufactured. I bought it brand new and several pages had fallen out of the binding just weeks after purchase."
2,Scarf Review,"Pretty good, but this scarf is itchy and a lot wider than I thought it would be. It's not really practical for every-day use, but for a costume piece this is good. The emblem is just a patch, so if you find a striped scarf and can buy a Slytherin patch for less money, I would recommend that instead. But this is a cute scarf if that's something that you're interested in."
2,A Good Price,Everything works and after 10 movies I have had no problems. Everyting was ready to go from the box.
2,GREAT CD! I love it!,"The first song on this album had me hooked. I loved the sound of Headroom.Besides bringing us Addicted to Bass, which everyone should know and love if they like the dance circuit, they bring us some other aspect of their style, which is all really good."
2,A toy for every preschooler,"My three year old can't get enough of this learning toy. She sings, repeats letter noises and loves the different levels (ie. games, learning colors and music.) She really like having the two interchangable face plates for different activities (coloring plate and numbers with Leap and friends) The fact that it comes with three sets of the letter coloring sheets was great. I don't think I could have imagined the fun she is having. The positive feedback when correct numbers, colors or friends are found is great. If she can not find correct color or number it encourages her to keep trying by giving her little hints. (ie. the number 8 comes after 7 and is the color yellow.) The only problem- My 16 month old wants to play with it too!! I will be purchasing another one real soon. THIS TOY IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY PRESCHOOLER"
1,Not what expected,These pads do protect your knees WHEN they stay in place. Regardless of how tight I make them they slip down and then I must move them back to where they belong.
2,Great basic holster!,"Love this holster! Simple design, easy to use! Its also way cool that it comes with not just the belt attachment, but the paddle as well, which is super comfortable. I have an extended mag release on my Glock 22, and a lot of people complain that it rubs your side when the firearm is holstered... not true at all. This holster rocks! Cant beat Serpa CQC holsters!"
2,Great Stockpot,"The Calphalon Stockpot is fantastic. It is the perfect size for making large amounts of soup, but not too large like the 20 quart sizes that you normally see. It heats up quickly and evenly and cleans up easily. I am now considering buying other Calphalon cookware and I would recommend this stockpot to anyone! The shipping was very fast and it was packaged well and secure."
2,Pretty good.,It's a good translation which was easy to follow. A good book if you want to learn more about Han Fei Zi.
1,"don't buy, brakes too easily","Three weeks after I bought this headset, the plastic inside the microphone handle broke. I fixed it with tape, but it affected the quality of the call (people would not be able to understand me properly, unless I would hold the handle). I emailed the company and sent them pictures of it. they were really nice and sent me a new one. only a few weeks later the new headset broke at the same place as the old one. I emailed the company again and got a second replacement, which is now broken too!the quality of the plastic that holds the microphone handle in place is not good enough.if you don't mind fixing the headset with tape once it brakes and then hold on to the handle while you're talking, this is a good headset ;-)"
2,This is not that bad.,"I missed Teknoman when it originally aired in the States, but I was introduced to it via Tekkaman Blade II, and then, Wikipedia when I tried to find the original.As someone who saw a more.. shall we say, faithfully translated.. branch before I saw Teknoman, I can say that while the name changes are annoying to a point it doesn't change my enjoyment of these collections! I still want the Japanese-only subbed version (I have season 1) but I like being able to get the gist of the original story without having to wade through it all.Purists will find a lot to pick apart - heck, even I do - but I still recommend them. :)"
2,The Best Album of the Year,"Every song on this cd is excellent , the 2 songs that can be heard on the radio ( heavy and run ) simply make it better , every song on this album is great . A must buy . A+."
1,bad business,"i bought this book brand new from amazon.com an within 3 days of class 8 pages fell out the front of book !! i dont know if its amazon or a poor publisher but this is rediculous !!! now the front pages fell out 3 weeks ago but just last night while i was looking up a definition in the glossary more pages are falling out the back of the book !! danm !! i took the plastic off this book, it was new an now its falling apart ! this has never happend before with me but i dont know what to do ! i need the book for class but its falling apart ! i should get a new book from amazon! IF U KNOW WHERE I CAN EMAIL THIS PROBLEM TO GET RESULTS PLEASE E-MAIL ME !!! gdelelli@student.southgatech.com !!!sincerely gerard delellis jr"
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,I live in Oregon. I bought this set and could not play the DVD. It will not play on the DVD player or on the computer and we even changed regions. I love James Blunt and have his CD (the CD in this set is great too after you get used to it being live) but I found the DVD impossible to play. I paid for something I can't even use!
1,Misfits don't live up to the hype!!,The new misfits box set is kind of a clunker. It's like they're still in the 70's. The recording sound extremely dated to say the least.I say keep the $60! Jason B.
1,The Sound and the Fury,"Most over rated writer of all time. I have tried several of his books and do not like any of them. Try Fitzgerald or Hemingway if you want authors in his timeframe. If you want short stories, try Alice Munro or William Trevor. For my money, they are two of the all time BEST....."
2,Very Good Book,"This is a very intresting book that gives you glimpses into what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling and how she delt with them by her faith in God.However, it does bother me that this book is an adaptation of Rachel's journals and that the reader may not be getting the whole picture(and this only adds to my personal skepticism of some things surrounding her death and why she died) and this is why I gave the book 4 stars.Overall, this is a very good book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling."
2,Brings back good ol' memories of Texas and Oklahoma!,"As an old Okie who grew up in the '50s listening to the Texas/Oklahoma variety of western swing music, Hank Thompson always stood out as the best ever. His band was always top notch, tight and tasteful, with a sound that made people want to dance. Hank's singing, with that warm sincere voice, always pleased the ear. On this new CD he sounds exactly the same, if not better, and the band is great. His unique songs like ""Green Light"" and ""I'll Still be Here Tomorrow"" show his mix of humor and simple sincerity, with musical taste."
1,good for a few years,"we got these a few years back, and i loved the way it looked. however, after a year or two, they started breaking. if you used your fork to cut into somthing, the round meTal part that holds the fork/spoon/knife head, cracked and one by one all our forks broke. we have had it for 4 years and all our forks are broken, the round metal cap at the bottom of the handles have come off, and the round metal part that holds the utensil heads have all rusted and turned brownits good for a short while, but not for daily use. i regret buying these and will now only buy all metal utensils that can't break"
2,Not bad for the price,Works great and sounds good. If anyone needs an external card like me who doesn't have an extra pci slot to spare this is definately the way to go.
2,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:","JLO IS A CHICAGO COP WHO IS EMBITTERED BY HER OWN FAMILY LIFE OF SPOUSAL ABUSE. SHE MEATS CATCH, WHO WOULD APPEAR TO BE A TRANSIENT STREET WALKER BUT HE SAVES HER LIFE WHEN SHE IS ALMOST KELLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING EYE'S THAT DRW YOU RIGHT IN. SHE BECOMES MORE AND MORE ENTRANCES BY CATCH. IN THE END SHE FINDS OUT THE SHE HAS SAVED HIS LIFE. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. JM"
2,Fantastic Book,"I chose this book from several options for a class. Tovani has insight into what stands in the way of students' reading comprehension and useful strategies for how to prevent ""fake reading"". Best of all, though, Tovani uses examples as 'models' for how to put her strategies into action in a classroom and what response to expect when you do."
2,good compilation,"This book is well organized, and gives a lot of pratical exercises very usefull for those who works with the frail erderly, but i didn't found anything new in it. On that matter,i was a litle bit disapointed"
2,If you want HEAT buy this heater,Wanted to suppliment our old baseboard heaters in our basement and looked around at brands. Delongi seemed reputible and we had an old oil filled radiator we used that worked well so we tried a couple. Got the retro model and the safe heat one was back ordered. The retro model was fantastic and warmed our large baement real well. Couldnt wait to see how well the other one works. Other one finally came but I didnt mind the wait since it was summer. Well let me tell you - it put another model of radiater from Honeywell that I had found on clearance at Home Depot to shame. The Delongi Safe Heat Dragon warmed our huge family room and the other did not warm a small bed room - maybe I can return the other to Home Depot!If you want HEAT - buy this model - it is great for the size. I was amazed!!Tammy
2,If you love Trains,"I love the Milwaukee Road! And this all about Milwaukee Road Steam, with a plot thrown in, that will make ya cry!"
2,Many true-to-life scenarios,"I was very entertained by this book--by the genuine feelings and actions of the main character--Joey Becker. Jo's rationalization of her actions and her criticism of those rationalizations was something many female readers can relate to. However, I did find Daniel's character a little too saintly and the daughters a bit too nasty. I was enthralled however with the youngest daughter's explanation for the nastiness in the twins. This book was filled with many experiences that are true to life!"
1,ghost in the shell game,"Beautiful animation, absolutely incomprehensible story. I felt like I was watching the Matrix after someone had arbitrarily scrambled all the scenes. It has to do with dolls that kill (for reasons I couldn't figure out), which for some reason had a need for human souls, and are finally tracked down by a detective based on clues that don't seem to be explained in any way."
2,My son loves it!,"My 2 1/2 son recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!"
1,Ignore the review from Robert C Taylor,My copy is packed with essential information on purchase and body restoration. I have bought and restored two MGBs using this guide and in both cases got slightly better than I was expecting. Can't speak the the later issue entitled 'MGB Restoration Manual' but have been assured by others that it contains more or less the same information. It is an *essential* resource for anyone contemplating buying an MGB.
1,"Terrible Book, Buggy Code Samples","For an introduction to Internet programming techniques, this book is too narrowly focussed. It only covers and implements a proprietary Internet control completely ignoring Wininet and Winsock. On top of this the code samples are extremely buggy and are not supported by the author's VB website! Avoid at this price, might be useful at bargain basement prices only as alearning exercise in debugging terrible code."
1,"....Y como dijo la cancion, ""POR QUE?""","Este cd contiene canciones NO EN SU ESTADO ORIGINAL DE GRABACION POR LOS ORIGINALES ARTISTAS. No ay como las canciones viejitas pero con el sonido original. Desafortunadamente, este cd no es asi.....Bueno, pues ya minimo aprovecho para saludar a mis parientes alla en VICTORIA DE CORTAZAR, GUANAJUATO desde aqui, CHICAGO......SALUDOS!!! ~DJ LUPE AYALA"
1,Fantasies,"There is no doubt that Christ suffered, but there is absolutely no biblical or historical evidence for much of the content of this film. Impressive visuals and sound cannot change the fact that this effort is overloaded not with historical truths, but with Gibson's fantasies. Of course he has the right to display his version of events, but the rest of us need not be fooled."
2,A new frontiere from the past,"I think many people will not love this album. But I think they will be wrong. I mean from the beginning of the cd to the last note you are in touch with the soul of bjork. The emotions that it gave to me were so beautiful and I can't tell you how much I felt happy. It's not really only vocal cd, there are many electronic effects and percussions and choirs. If you love "" An echo a stain "" You will Love this record. It is the natural step after Vespertine, is hard but so deep, so human, so different each time you listen it. I'm so curious to see how she will make the next tour. Buy it and sorry for my poor english !!!!!!"
2,Exhilarating,This album is one of my all time favorites. I may even go as far as to rank it right up there with Aenema from tool. The songs are emotionally charged seamlessly blending together beautiful melody with hard hitting guitar riffs and earth shattering bass. Just an all around superb album.
1,Poorly done,"I can only compare this to the Laurence Harvey LP that I lost 20 some-odd years ago, and it is a poor imitation. It becomes apparent immediately that Mr. Prysock is an amateur when it comes to dramatic reading. This poem requires a skilled professional, such as Mr. Harvey, to provide the tonal nuances and subtle changes of cadance that bring these words to life. Also, the music is inappropriate and in many places overpowers the speaker. Use your money to buy the book."
2,excellent belt. definetly will continue to use it on future travels.,"Used this in Italy. Kept our cash and passports in it. Has a waterproof plastic pouch inside. It rained really hard one day in Rome, and surprisingly nothing got wet. I will definetly use this on future travels."
1,Nepotism at its finest.,"I don't understand the hype about this book. The writing style was amateurish. The ending was telegraphed right from the start, the only shocking think was just how over the top it was. The only reason this manuscript wasn't thrown in the trash where it belongs, is clearly because of his father who just happens to be the editor of Sports Illustrated."
1,Mahogany - skip it.,"ALthough it looks like a pretty piece, be advised that the back made of two pieces of a cheep material held together with duct tape. This is more MDF covered with veneer than one would expect at this price. The pre-drilled holes do not match up and, as a result, it is difficult to get the magnets to hold the door together appropriately. The cabinet took no less than five hours to assemble. When ours arrived one door was slightly warped - warped enough to make it so the magnets don't hold the door shut. Although the company promptly sent a replacement door, it will be another 30 minutes of work to replace it."
1,What is this stuff?,"Woah... From blistering hella good guitar rifts to this hardly rock, pop stuff--one can only ask: what where they thinking? There is really no song on this album where you get a feel for what the Scorpions are actually known and loved for: their heavy, driving beats and melodic harmonies. I am a HUGE Matthias Jabs fan, and I don't even hear one guitar solo on this album where he really gets to show his amazing talent. Where are all the guitars? Where's the rock? Where are the Scorpions?!"
1,Really?,"This is just a repackaged edition of the same book. I read it 10 years ago and was not impressed with its religious overtones. That aside, where does Rick Warren come off calling this non-fiction? These writings are his opinion and nothing more. No thanks."
2,Great package deal!,"I bought these locks for my kids to use at school. They are a nice looking and functional way to secure school bikes. I particularly like the interchangeable keys. The new rule in our house is ""if you loose your key, don't call home, find your brother"". They work fine, even my 6-year old can lock and unlock his bike.I almost didn't buy these because of the comments about cable size here on Amazon. If you have some zillion dollar bike you probably want a thicker stronger cable, maybe with GPS tracking and some of those dye-packs that tellers throw in with the cash in bank robberies. These locks are extremely strong, no one is going to break them without serious bike-theft tools. They will certainly deter any but the most ambitious, professional and prepared thief."
2,Great Foodsaver,I have had this machine for about 2 years and had trouble free operations. Could have a faster seal cool off system for faster operation but satisfied the way it is.
2,It's A Twisted Killing,"This movie is a fun Russian mafia heist movie. Lowly Charlie, a russian immigrant gets caught up in a diamond smuggling job only to have his friends flip on him and try to take the diamonds. Figuring out where the switch happens is fun and when Charlie fights back, he fights back hard!!! The twists and turns at the end are fun and worth the watch. Check this one out!!!Date Movie (Unrated Edition)"
2,"Good Quality, Excellent Price","For the price, this is a top notch set. Have not used them, but look very solid!"
1,Not what I thought it was,"Although as a teacher I appreciate the literature included, I was under the impression (from the title) that this book would have sections for children to read, and complimenting sections for parents to read. I bought it for my young readers, and it is basically a read aloud book."
1,A good record book for the first year.,"For my first son I found such a complete book that records memories until age seven, that I wanted the same for my second baby. However, since it has been impossible to locate, I found this book which I think is O.K. No doubt is more complete than many I have found in my search, but I think its title is misleading since it says ""A record of your early years"" and it actually covers only the first year. Also, I think there are sections completely unrelevant (for instance too much on the grandparents instead of information to complete about the new baby). If you are the kind of person who would like to record in detail the physical and social development of your child, this is not the book to buy. If you are looking for a book with very nice illustrations for the first year, then it is o.k."
1,mother looking for all the answers,"I have to admit that I read this book all the way through, and tried all the suggestions only to find that my son did not respond to any of it. He is eight weeks old now and only waking once through the night after my husband and I tried our own method. And I think thats pretty good. This book says to wake your child to get them on a routine which made him more irratable and less apt to fall asleep for more than 20 minutes at a time throughout the day and the night. Now I let him sleep as long as he wants. He is much happier when he wakes up.I wouldn't tell anyone to pratice the methods in this book."
2,Very good!,Im using this bed rail as a headboard for my dorm room bed so my pillows dont fall off. It works perfectly! It is the perfect size and isn't too high that is seperates the room. I'm glad i got it
2,A Great buy!,"I love my Zen. I've had it over a month now. The software is included, but you can use windows explorer to load it.Music, Videos, storage, Date Book, calander, Alarm Clock, Voice Recorder, and an FM Radio!It does way more than they advertise.It works with Windows, Yahoo Music, Audible Books and more.Right now I'm downloading videos from YouTube!I have never had to use the reset button.Right now there are hundreds of songs stored on mine, I lost count at 250!All high quality audio.Now the bad news. It is a little slow to start up.Go ahead and buy the (expensive) charger from the manufacturer.I have found nothing else that works.The screen it VERY bright in the dark, but still hard to see in sunlight.Most files will have to be converted. I've found free software for that.( www.Downloads.com ) YouTube Grabber, YouTube FLV to AVI Suite.This has been a good product for me. A Great buy![...]"
1,Not for serious readers,"If you truely wish to learn the tarot you must choose a deck that speaks to you and derive your own meanings from them. This book gives you a 'set' responce to each card with no room for personal insights. Also it does deal more with numerology and games, as a reveiwer recently stated, than the real tarot. Some of the spreads, however, have been useful."
2,The best!,Spider-man is the greatest game boy game you could possibly make!The only thing I don't like is its to short I beat it in like one week but its still cool cause you can still play the game over and over. And after you beat the game you get level cheat were you can skip levels. And if you beat the game with over 15000 points you get super strength. I recomened this game if you like spiderman or not. This game will make you love spiderman.
1,Junk..,I ordered the heater to help heat my basement. It sure is a disappointment . It has no thermostat and can not be left unattended. Who ever heard of a heater without temperature control. Will it burn my house down?
2,Good fun,"We ended our weekly poker session with these hilarious cards the other night. The captions are too funny. We couldn't stop laughing... or arguing.Half the cards are pro-Bush and anti-Kerry, the other half are pro-Kerry and anti-Bush. There are two copies of the major candidates and party personalities; one complimentary and one less flattering. Cleverly done. ""National Insecurity Adviser"" Rice and ""Control-Al-Delete"" Gore are my favorites.I'm sure these will make more appearances at the table."
2,Can't Wait,"I am looking forward to getting this dvd. The special features may not be good, but at least we are getting the season (better than the volumes)!"
1,item is described inaccurately,"Received, but was disappointed that it is Kwikset Security, not Kwikset MAXIMUM Security as described. There is a big difference between the two."
2,From a network administrator's perspective,"I read this book as part of my first course in a Ph.D.-MIS program. I thought it was a great overview and history of MIS, and provided insight into alternative IS management styles and strategies. The case studies were relevent, current, well written and interesting. I recommend this book for all network and systems administrators. It gives insight into what thought processes should be occurring at the CIO and IS manager levels."
2,Exactly what I needed,"Yes, I agree setup is difficult if you are not computer saavy. But I got it opened, configured, and playing music/slides on my family room TV in less than 2 hours while working on other things.I haven't done playlists, but overall I like the performance and interface. A great low cost option for people who have a wireless network and want to display photos or play music. Now I can move my CD Carousel to another room in the house!"
1,"Good, but........","I am a beginner soap maker and found this book to be extremely informative. There is a great amount of information regarding the different types of oils and additives you can use. But, being a beginnger, I found the recipes waaay to intimidating and extremely large. I almost got turned off of soap making thinking that I would need a scale to measure lye to tenths of grams! (i.e. lye weight 567 7/10 gm) Also her recipes call for you to make batches of at least 40 bars each, an amount I was not interested in making. There is a lot of good information in this book, but I think that this book is for people extremely serious about soap making."
1,Anemic and incorrect,"From having played professionally for many years, this little guide has some very serious mistakes on the care and filing of the fingernails. This is most detrimental to the welfare of the playing of a nylon string guitar, for anyone who evers wants to play well."
1,Stuck with Brother's Ink too,"if you print a lot and try to save ink expense, do not buy this one. I could not refill it with low-cost-bottled ink; I have to buy the expensive original Brother ink which runs out quick."
2,guilty pleasure,"VERY fun game. it also has many interesting features that are never been seen in video games. such as real time. You cant play one week and return the next month. The other townspeople would miss you, people would move out and move in. people would be mad you didnt return your shirt, etc. Also if you screw up, you cant just restart the game. this mole screams at you when you try and return to the game. I was a fan of harvest moon which made me draw myself to this game and this has many features that hm doesnt have that makes it a real guilty pleasure. Oh the hours spent decorating my home.......t_t.. and theres still not enough room for the fishtank.."
2,the Ultimate Collection Is the Ultimate!,"Even though it says 3 seasons it is the ENTIRE COMPLETE SERIES!!!!!i AM A PAUL GROSS ADDICT AND THIS ROUNDED OUT MY COLLECTION OF HIS WORKS QUITE NICELYI'm disappointed that such fin acting is put on the cheapest easily damaged plastic disks Dvd's used to be on high quality polycarbonate if it scratched you could use a little Carbona dry cleaning spot treatment ruib it on and buff any scratches away. tjhat won't work any more because a german co. bought carbona and stopped making the dry cleaner spot treatment and are selling their mediocre enzyme treatments instead so handle with care.I didnt seat a disk properly and it played but now 2 episodes are ruined becauise it rubbed the loading tray as it played and therre are really deep scratches otherwise A+ for good solid entertainment without simulated sex scenes and gratuitous violence Youll love Benton Frasier and Diefenbacher, his deaf wolf, and their escapades!"
2,Smooth quick shave,"This is my first electric shaver. It is quick and easy. My beard isn't particularly thick, so this does the job just great."
2,Good Deck - Good Value,I replaced my 20 year old single deck Onkyo tape deck with the Dual deck Onkyo TARW255. I didn't buy it for the dual decks. I bought it because I was pleased with the quality of my old Onkyo deck which eventually had a problem and parts are no longer available. Also the price was right. I've only had it for about a month and have not used it often. It appears to work well and has more features than I'll ever need. I find the controls a little confusing but then there is a learning curve for all new electronic devices. I'll climb the curve as I use it more often.
1,Too much of a good thing,"I was quite dissapointed in this book, particularly given the hype and the other reviews. While the introduction was well done, I thought a surprising number of the recipes were mayonnaise-based, and that the portions were all over the place. In one recipe, two -2lb pork tenderloins (no waste) feed four people (pg. 144) as does 2 lbs. of ground beef (again no waste; pg. 156) yet in another, two 1 lb. bone-in T-bone steaks feed six people (lots of waste). That seems off. What also seems off are the calories. I noticed that on several of the recipes, by the time you end up figuring in calories for fat and various other caloric ingredients (e.g. avocado, cheese, nuts), you're close to the nutritional analysis calories before you even add the meat (e.g. pgs. 166/67 & 130/31).I guess it's just not my thing!"
2,Nice toothpick holder,"It's three and one quarter inches long, three eighths in diameter not counting the pocket clip, and will hold 7 or 8 round toothpicks without being too tight to get stuck.Since I am used to carrying other things in my pants pockets, this toothpick holder is not a problem for me. It can be clipped on a shirt pocket as well."
1,I do not think this filter works well.,I have this filter. When the water is used in a humidifier it leaves red slimy deposits. When the water is left in a Poland Spring bottle for a week it smells like dirt. So how can it be filtering the water well?
1,Beach Music may be the worst book that I have ever read.,"So much of this book was unbelievable, beginning with the characters' names - Ledare, Shyla, Tee, John Harlan, Dallas - what kind of names ARE those? The scene with the four friends lost at sea for two weeks was completely unbelievable, and became laughable when the boys were rescued by holding on to the antler of a swimming deer that led them home. The scene where Jack was in the hospital bathing his mother and shampooing her hair because she had become violently ill;shouldn't he have called a nurse? It's frightening that such a book could become a best seller."
1,the broken shoe strap!,"the same day I tried themthey broke @ the strap & they are hard to keep on your feet when walking on your lawn, i would buy these again if they were to make them more comfortable & extra durable!"
1,Speed Train Your Own Bird Dog,"I returned this book the day I rcvd it. All it took is for me to flip through the pages and see the trainer recommending giving a knee to teach the dog not to jump up and then the very disturbing picture of him teaching ""whoa"" using a rope thrown over a tree while tied to the dogs neck while standing on a barrel.I have worked around horses and dogs for many years and certainly advocate force when necessary. However, I feel that there are many more ways to train a dog than using the types of methods mentioned above-hence why I returned it."
1,"Bad, very bad.","Do whatever you can to find a text that more clearly explains the theories and theories in practice of language teaching. I am currently using as a textbook in an introductory Teaching ESL course. We read out of it, but most of the material is omitted, corrected or adjusted by our instructor."
1,This Movie is Terminally BAD!,"Boring, slow, Dull, one of the WORSE movies I have ever viewed. Save Yourself some precious time and watch a good movie, i wish i did. how the heck could a studio allow such rubbish to be released. it makes you wonder."
2,Sony battery,I received the battery in good time and in excellent condition. I am happy with the transaction.
1,Is this a Soap Opera?,"I'm reading the Tower books with my kids, and I'm about ready to call it quits! Number three...yet another book providing little satisfaction in the story. I'm feeling like this series is more about selling books than anything else! I feel like we're tuning in to the never-ending soap opera at several bucks a pop. At this rate, Tal's mom will die of old age before he ever gets her out of that coma!"
2,Works well,I installed this in an auxilliary diesel fuel tank on my truck. It was easy to adjust to the specific tank size & gives accurate fuel level signals on a Sunpro gauge that I purchsed at the same time. The only negative is a lack of signal damping resulting in the gauge needle swinging about when driving on rough roads.
2,My all time favorite Coffee Maker,"I've owned many coffee makers, this is by far my favorite... I was searching for a replacement and was disappointed to see they don't make one like it anymore...Pros: Keeps coffee Hot. Easy to fill the water tank. Makes really good coffee. Durable. Easy to use.Cons: Almost impossible to pour without spilling a little bit. Takes up half the counter unless you mount it."
2,Excellent craftsmanship!!,These earrings are a piece of artwork. The craftsmanship is great. The only issue I have with these earrings is the size / weight. They are quite heavy and you have to put the backs on very tightly if you want them to hang nicely. They come nicely packaged and NOVICA does an excellent job of communicating the status of the order.
2,It's All That,"Mainly just want to give this 5 stars. Before I bought the CD back in the 90s, I already knew I liked The Cure, but this CD elevated them in my mind. I became protective of the CD and didn't really play it around other people or any of that because, you know what happens when people want to ""borrow"" a CD. Anyway, I eventually let a relative borrow it once and, of course, it's gone. That thing was still completely playable after all that time... Well, here I am now looking to get a replacement. But yeah, the CD is more than just a mix, it's like a reworking and to be perfectly clear, the songs are just plain better on this CD than the prior versions (IMNSHO). Worth every penny and then some."
1,not new cd's just a package of allready produced cd's,These were not newly produced cd's. They were a composition of cd's that had been put out before.
1,Defective Copy,"Many unprinted pages (114, 115, 118, 119,122, 123,126,127,130,131, 134,135, 138, 139, 142, 143) that neither Princeton Paperbacks (not sold directly by them) or Amazon (more that 30 days) would stand behind.This is a book that gave me additional prspestives to i."
1,Check out the individual reviews of these books,The TCP/IP book is good The IIS4 Books is useless The Proxy Server 2 Book is useless The Windows 95 Book is alright - plus you shouldn't be taking the 95 test anyway. You should take the NTW test instead.STAY AWAY from this set. THE CORE PACK is good. THE ELECTIVES PACK IS USELESS!
2,A funny movie!,"HoodWinked is about someone stealing all the goodies and the suspects are,little red rideing hood,the wolf,granny,woodsman.If you love fairy tales and action you should go see this."
1,"yes, he's a handsome vampire","Title says it all... and that's what 60% of the book is about.The vampire is handsome.And just in case we didn't mention it, the vampire is handsome.Oh... let's throw in some action at the end to kinda-sorta have a story...Please don't hate me, I read the book, I just didn't like it so much.In an ironic twist, the movie was better."
2,A Masterpiece!!!,Combine the genius of the late Stanley Kubrick (probably the best director of all time) and Steven Spielberg and you get the must moving piece of story telling ever. This movie will outlast all the dumb criticism thrown against it. Truly a masterpiece.
2,"Excellent, fits perfect the Mp15-22","I asked arround at the SW Forum and i had my option limited to 2. This was one of them. Its really a straight up installation, only consider that you require a 3/16 Allen before you start to change the Grip. It behaves very good at the range, even at high summer Temperatures...Changing the grip was really easy, no modifications required as you will need with other brands...You will not go wrong if you are looking for a new grip for your MP15-22."
1,Inaccurate outdoor temperature reading,"Looks nice, easy to mount. Overpriced and outside reading is affected by heat inside the house radiating through the window pane."
2,A CD for fans and collectors,"I would recommend buying this CD in addition to the US release of ""Under these Rocks and Stones"". Not only are there four bonus tracks, the packaging features completely different photos and a better layout. Leaving on a Jet Plane (the final bonus track) was performed better by Peter Paul and Mary, but Chantal is much more personable, and has more fun with it."
2,Thought provoking,"First class writing - Ruth Rendell is one of the best writers of this genre. Great plot, truly believable characters and despite being written decades ago, it still rings true to today's world. Rendell's characters are real people in life-like situations and Wexford is one of the most down to earth detectives ever imagined who comes to life on the page with a humanity that we should all strive to achieve in reality.I recommend this book to all readers who appreciate great writing, great characters, intricate plotting and an author who understands the frailty of human existence and the nuances of human interaction, both intellectual and emotional, in our daily lives.LR"
2,Very good Lindsey!,"I know some objected to the beginning with what Rowena did to Warrick,but it was the times. All in all it's one of my favorite of her books. Lots of steamy love scenes. I recommend this read."
1,"Donny, what were you thinking?? Why do ""Muzak"" 70's songs?","Oh Donny...what were you thinking?? This album is absolutely horrendous! (Which is heartbreaking for me to say, as I'm such a huge fan of yours. I love everything you've ever done...except this.)Perhaps if you'd tried new, fresh arrangemets for these tired, tired 70's songs, it MIGHT have worked.But why pick songs that have been relegated to elevator/grocery store ""Muzak"" when there are so many great songs out there to cover??? (And adding insult to injury, to do them with arrangement virtually identical to the originals??) I don't get it.Perhaps next time Donny will cover some classic Motown songs with cutting edge arrangements (songs he performed extraordinarily well during the concert segments of the 70's ""Donny & Marie"" Show), Stevie Wonder or other songs. (Or even more Broadway tunes, such as ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miserables and other classic shows would have been wonderful compared to this.)"
1,does not work too well for small amounts of gas in tank,I tried to remove gasoline from my snowblower tank and couldn't maintain a continuous flow to siphon 'all' of the gas out of the tank. It doesn't work for small amounts of gas in the bottom of the tank. I'm going to try Terapump rotary manual drum pump which has good reviews.
2,As honest as music will ever be.,"When you posess the talent that Townes Van Zandt obvioulsy does there is no need to add anything to it. This is about as bare as music gets. One microphone, one guitar and one great songwriter. This album offers music that is as pure and honest as anything commited to vinyl or tape or laser ever has been. Many of the Van Zandt standards are here and a few covers as well. This was recorded live in 1973 in a small club in Houston. All the atmosphere is there and the listener is drawn right into the middle of the evening. An excellant album from one of history's truly great songwriters."
1,2 for ease of use,"I bought this stroller for our three year old daughter yesterday and will be taking it back tomorrow morning. It took my husband and I to snap the pieces together and a lot or re-snapping to get them to stay in place. Once we got it together, our daughter could not switch it to any other position...nor could I. The pieces kept snapping out and the plastic pieces that hold the frame together are already showing signs of stress. While pushing the stroller through the house, the front tray simply fell off. We were quite upset with the wheels also. The wheels are simply hard plastic and do not turn well. I was disappointed that I had to take this toy away from our daughter, she was so excited to get it. Spend a bit more and buy the graco car seat stroller combo, much higher quality."
2,"Good, but not on their own.","I'd highly recommend these books in conjunction with the 'Transcender' exams. Together they cover basically everything, and if you want proof I managed to become an MCP with no hands-on experience."
1,Many Laughs,"You would need a calculus formula to calculate the amount of breakdowns on this CD, and a strong will to find a part of a song that isn't a breakdown. Typical mosh pit nonsense, with intense militant lyrics to back it all up: ""Nowhere to hide, searching for a piece of pie!"" This disc will leave you hungrier for a good song than the singer is for a piece of pie."
2,It looks easy but aint!,"This game is though...but not for me!i beat the game !lol!i have mega emg,belzelga,wonder A,rokusho,zorin,and many more...have trouble beating samantha at the beggining?Well use your head(Antenna)then the right arm(sword)and again right arm AND then left arm (pipo Hammer) yay!trouble agaist Squidguts??use anti sea !!"
2,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I enjoyed Where the Red Fern Grows because of the courage,glory,and love that Little Ann and Old Dan gave to Billy.Wilson Rawls is a great writer and keeps me on the tip of my seat the whole time I was reading it.If you want to know more about the book,read it and you'll never forget this book.(#16)"
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would","Yuk, Yuk and Yuk. Lindsey loves to bring old characters from previous novels into more recent novels. I think this is an excuse she uses not to have to develop new characters. This book took the cake on revisting previous characters. In fact the book was more re-introducing you to them then it was a new story.Her conversations were too frequent and boring. I did not like the Brittany or Dalen. They had no chemistry as far as I am concerned. I could not even finish this one, what a waste of cash."
1,No,"I will buy anything even remotely similar to this band. I will praise even sub-par releases from this band such as Love Beach and In The Hot Seat. I will defend this band to my last breath knowing they have been bashed and maligned relentlessly by the music press and so called ""rock critics"". I have seen this band perform live so many times I have lost count. But I will never understand the logic behind this release."
2,plane insanity....,"An interesting read from a flight attendant's perspective of his 16 years on the job. Some parts will make you laugh out loud, but when I picked it up from the library the other day, having never seen the book before, I didn't expect it to be insanely funny (despite the praise on the back cover), but more a FA writing about his experiences. A look from the inside, if you will. And that's what I feel it delivered. It was interesting and well written with the right amount of humor."
1,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman","I was going to order the 2nd volume of Mary Hartman only to find out: #1 It's not on DVD, but VHS! I don't have a real problem with that since I have a combo-player. However, the reviews have showed that the tape is a rip-off! Missing episodes which obviously makes it harder to follow the story.Also, it is extremely short, timewise. Why doesn't someone create a decent, professional Volume 2? Then, and only then will I by it!Marilyn Murphy"
2,Excellent edition,"I think I speak for many when I say that after many years of enjoying Tolkien's book, I wanted to have a nice copy for my library. The books I read as a boy show their age and as Lord of the Rings is one of my ""must have"" books, I wanted an particularly special edition. Sound familiar? For like-minded individuals, there are essentially two choices: the single volume with Alan Lee's gorgeous illustrations (he later became artistic advisor for the movies) or the 50th Anniversary Edition. I got the best of both worlds -- bought the illustrated version for myself and this one for my finacee! As nice as the Lee watercolors are, the 50th Anniversary really is the better book. The binding, paper, cover, and feel are amazing... THIS is what a great book should feel like. Also, this is the final revised text, so it is marginally better. Don't let the price discourage you, it is definitely worth it, and this is a book to treasure."
1,A Poor Product!! Not Worth The Money!! Don't Buy!!,"I am embarassed to say that I have purcased 3 Litter Maid Mega 900 Models and every single one died and untimely death right after the warranty period had expired. I liked the idea of the Litter Maid even though there were some ""issues"" with it. Like clumping of poo on the rake that would cause it to go over and over again. Cleaning the unit was a nightmare! I must say though I will not be buying a 4th one after the failure of the 3rd one I feel like the biggest fool in the world! Whats the old saying Fool me twice shame on me! Well after 3 SHAME ON ME! I wonder how many of these are clogging up landfills across the country?? I won't be buying a 4th one!"
2,Must see!!!,Great movie!!! Must see! Music CD will be the best!! Well done!!! Will become a great franchise!!
1,Dead in 5 days,"During the first four days of its life I liked my Gigabeat 60. Its interface is intuitive, and the sound is good. In fact, I ordered a second unit for my wife. I don't play videos so whatever problems there are there is of no concern to me. The only problem during this honeymoon was that the battery was dead every morning. I assumed this was due to operator incompetency and wowed to plug it in every night.However now, on day five the unit is dead. Toshiba service does not answer the phone, I cannot find any helpful information on the web. They are both going back.at in Florida"
2,so very pleased,I have been looking forward to having a copy of this to call my own since viewing a friend's. Reading the books only makes the movies better.
2,A Must Have,"What better subject for a talented artist to explore than the beauty of youth. As usual, Hamilton, presents his subject in a compelling and idyllic fashion. I also just recommended the Rituals of Summer DVD at Amazon for the Hamilton enthusiast. Perhaps Hamilton will follow the lead and create DVDs from his numerous video titles."
2,A wonderful reminder...,"These beautifully written cards allows the wisdom of the books to apply to us in an easy, daily fashion. I simply pull a card from the pack each morning and know what it is I need to focus on throughout the day. The quotes were chosen perfectly, and the calligraphy and design is simply beautiful. What a joyous way to get daily guidance!"
2,"Art Therapy, Inner Child, Internalized Parent...","This book has Art Therapy exercises and dialog exercises with your inner child (who can be playful, vulnerable, angry, etc). For instance you might be instructed to ask your inner child a question by writing it with your dominant hand. Then you answer the question with your nondominant hand (e.g. for many of us our left hand that we don't usually write with). There are also exercises that involve your internalized Parent (nuruturing, protective, critical, etc.)The exercises seem to be a blend of Art Therapy, Transactional Analysis and Gestault Experiments. As such the exercises can be somewhat risky since they bring up intense feelings. I wouldn't use some of these except under a therapist's supervision.However, this book seem VERY useful for adding to the tools of a practicing therapist."
1,Not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy,"Knowing the controversy surrounding this book, I bought it anyway thinking that the story might be a good one, even if it had been fabricated. I kept that attitude for about 2/3 of the book. At that point I got tired of listening to Frey, an admitted criminal, additct and all around loser, criticize those around him who had been able to do what he was incapable of--stay sober. His attitude that he was better and more sophisticated than the program he was participating in sounded like the immature rantings of an adolescent. I found it laughable that someone whose life was so obviously out of control had such a sense of superiority. I was also left wondering how he managed to maintain this sense of superiority when it was obvious that the program managed to help him, seemingly against his will. In the end, not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy."
1,Not as described.,The product description and photo show a three piece rod set. You only actually get one rod with handle. Returned.
2,"If Stranded with Only 2 Cookbooks, This Would Be One!","Without a doubt, this book delivers. Easy, tasty food from the very best chefs. Try the Roasted Peppers, Potatoes and Onions or any of the Pork recipes.A real favorite. In fact, I find myself going back to this over and over again, and am never disappointed."
2,Bob Dylan,"Bob Dylan Live, 1966.It is nice to go down Memory Lane and I am glad to have purchased the CD. I do have to say, though, I love his new music as much as I love his music from earlier years. For me, ""Dylan"" will always remain ""Dylan"".Ursula"
2,great bamboo resource,"I stumbled upon this book before I was about to purchase a bambusa vulgaris. This book was well written, informative and visually appealing. Since, I live out near the water, I needed to know how to care for and successfully grow bamboo in my backyard. With the help of this book, I have maintained a couple of potted bamboo plants outside and a giant one indoors. Helpful to a novice bamboo grower like myself, but also a good reference to keep always."
2,"Worked for me many years ago, and still works today for younger ones!",I had a copy of this many years ago and loved it!Bought it for a very creative grandchild.Suffice to say not of all the recycle goes to the recycle (at least right away). :^)
2,Another success by this renowned Oxford academic,"Once again the world's academic community is faced with a new, exciting and challenging study, in this book edited by the world-known Oxford academic Ngaire Woods (along with lesser known colleagues), with contributions from some of the world's leading names in this field. The editors' and the author's views come across vividly in the chapters, yet subjectively and impartially. The style is fervid, the prose is amene, and the book is overall enjoyable, also readable by the average cultured person and not just the expert."
1,Less than meets the eye.,"Games should be challenging. Humor should be funny. This book is neither. When the revolution comes, someone must answer for this."
1,don't buy it,"Besides being light on details, the copy I got had several key pages missing - there but just blank. Shows a lack of attention to detail. If you are just getting started in the tanning/leather/rawhide business it is an OK read about history and techniques but there are better books on the market. Get this one from the library."
1,sketchy concept overview w/ many wrong answers.......,"I grabbed this book from my local library to do some brushing up on some old high school concepts before reviewing some more serious calculus. There is very little intuitive development for what ""may"" be intended as prep material for standardized tests such as the ACT or GRE. For example, the proofs for geometrical volumes or surface areas are laughable at best,if existent at all. As an electrical engineer, I feel very confident in the answers I obtained...especially after double checking my own scratch work. I am seriously considering writing my own book based on the material that was thrown into this one....."
2,Good Overview of Training..,"I guess that's what the intent of this book and it gives examples from an expert in Training. The articles from several experts in the field of training also supports the content and adds value.Recommended if you need an overview, although in some chapters goes into details. Yet, there are several other books that focus on preparation, presentation, evaluation etc. which might be more focused on these topics."
1,Too abstract for a children's book,"It is much too abstract for a children's book. My 7-yr old was very disappointed and frustrated, despite my explanations of what the book was trying to describe. Thankfully, we only checked the book out from the library. If you're thinking of buying it, click the ""peek inside"" feature on Amazon to read a passage and make sure you will like it."
2,"This will do you right, son.","The aforementioned work by said ensemble can have a profound effect on one's prophecy. Jazz is not dead. Backstabber's Ball is most refreshing. 'Tis swung. 'Tis conceptual. 'Tis sinister. Above all, this album is sincere by some of the H ippest musicians in NYC, the carolinas, and the world. I highly recommend this album for all who love that which the world calls jazz. Check out the melodies. Discover the harmony. Listen to Neal Caine and Jason Marsalis. Hear Stephen Riley and Ned Goold. 'Tis a ball For Sho."
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"I bought this book thinking I would get some new and exciting information about the Powershot G5. Some tips and tricks on getting better photographs USING the G5 features. Instead, this book is just a combination of the EXACT same content from the Users Manual and any basic book on photography. Nothing new. Nothing exciting. Nothing interesting.It was also a big let down when I saw it. It's actually a bunch of black and white photocopies (Xerox) bound together in a spiral. Like a school report from the early 90's. It shouldn't cost more that five dollars.I believe the auther and publishers just put it together just to make some easy money. And I fell for it. I should've known when it had no reviews.After this, I will NEVER buy another book from them and I strongly suggest you see it before you buy it. No wonder you can't see the inside in amazon!!!"
2,KILL THEM ALL!,"A quote from Johny as they prepare for battle against the bugs. Most people think this movie is nothing but a bunch of people getting chopped into pieces. That isn't the case. This movie is very interesting when you consider the way the world is run (Like a giant military base) and also the characters actually make you feel something for them. Unlike most action movies you really don't care if one of the characters die. They take the time at the starting of the movie to show you what the characters were like before the war and how the war effected them. I'd give this movie 6 stars, one for every time I've seen it. END"
2,An old but still good book,"This book has been written before the Internet era. So the author talks about the newspaper and other ways to receive news, but no Internet. However the underlying mathematics is still valid if you extrapolate it for the Internet."
2,Styling and clean sound at a low price,This is a perfect unit for a small room. Don't expect too much out of it.
1,Horrible,Loved the design to these. After a short period of time they were all scratched. Pfaltzgraff sent a cleaner that was suppose to remove the scratches and it didn't work.
1,SHOULD BE PRESENTED UNABRIDGED!,TO MUCH IS LEFT OUT IN THE ABRIDGED. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED IN UNABRIDGED. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY PUBLISHERS THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE RIGHTS WILL NOT RELEASE THEM. THAT IS NOT RIGHT TO THOSE OF USE WHO A WAIT THE UNABRIDGED STORY.
1,mill is a problem,"The mill over grinds beans. For a ""flat"" filter versus a ""cone"" filter the grind should be on the large side. If you set the mill to the lowest setting the beans are hardly ground at all, on the next setting the beans are ground into dust, i.e. espresso grind.The latch over the mill broke on mine.When this machine finally dies I'll go back to one without the integrated mill."
1,Wheel of fortune,We found this version of WoF didn't have the correct drivers as part of its installation and needed some Micromedai Flashman 3 drivers. In our particular case we had to organise another graphics card to cope with what was required. Not very IT friendly.
2,Thornetta Davis,The CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thornetta Davis' music should be a part of every blues lover's collection!
1,Didn't last more than 2 months!,Would not recommend this light for the money. Did not last. Bought this because liked the fact it had lighter charger. Unfortunately it died quick and didn't even get to use it much.
2,Real Eel Skin Cigarette Case,I am very happy with this product. I received quickly and it was just as promised. I plan on purchasing another after the first of the year.
2,Perfect every time,This book was a lucky find for me. It's difficult to find a book with recipes that turn out well the first time you make them but this book has saved me countless times when cooking for a crowd due to its recipes that are universally enjoyed (sometimes difficult to accomplish with a roomful of guests) and very easy to follow. I think the Strata might be my favorite so far. Highly recommended...
2,mario kart,"first of if u have read any of the other reviews nocking this game dont listen.they say the ai is hard?that it takes 200 hours to unlock everthing?on the contery, the ai is unfortunately a bit to easy and its too easy to unlock everything.BUT this game was made for multiplayer and its the best multiplayer game available on the 'cube.you just have to practice.if you and your mates are fairly similar in ability on this game, the ai is more of an anoyance, as you and your mate battle it out with seconds to go and the a computer lobs a blue shell just as your mate hits a bannana.he recovers more quickly and takes the checkered flag.this kind of thing is a regualar ocurance in this game and thats what makes it great................................Matt Clough"
2,"Great item, but a bit pricey",Like my tittle say this is a great item but it is rather expensive for the amount of bags you get. But the Quality is great! This is a must have when camping!
2,trish boots review,I find great comfort in wearing my Trish boots. It has been over a month since I purchased them and I am commpletely satisfied. I am planning on buying another pair in a different color.
2,Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone,Great reading for all ages children and adults the book is better than the movie in my opinion. Read on
1,Hitler's Rise to Power,"Hitler rose to power when his book Mein Kampf, meaning My Struggle in English, became popular throughout Europe. He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke. Hungary was bought out during WWII and along with Austria was a big turncoat- Sweden remained a neutral country. I wasn't around during WWII, I don't know what it was like. Transylvania was bought out during WWII."
2,great movie,"Great movie and handled well with equal arguments and funy. But had to pay thirdy dolllars for it, mainly because I should have search elsewhere,"
2,Format makes good use of my time,"I really like this program and wouldn't change a thing. The ""audio flashcard"" format really works for me, and addresses the fundamental difficulty of learning any language: gaining critical mass of vocabulary. Over the past three months I have fairly well memorized the 1500 words and phrases of level one, and will soon start level II. Mostly this has been on my commute. Two disclaimers: this is an invaluable supplement to some other course-- it will not teach you how to make a sentence in Swedish. The other is that there is no effort to make this entertaining, so those that expect an enging story or song might be dissappointed. Me, I find anything that makes such efficient use of my time enjoyable, and I am grateful for the help the course has been."
1,WHAT THE *&^*?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I just bought this cd and popped it in my cd player, first song sounded familiar. I continued, next sounded familiar and the next one and the next one, what the hell?! I just got ripped for 13 of my hard earned dollars! im getting my f&%*ing money back. BE WARNED! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!Frukwan your as dead to me as poetic! YEAH I SAID IT!"
1,Gould? Where?,"I must admit I dislike calling this work a real performance since it is not more than a series of MIDI sequences (there are many other sequences - and better - in the world!).Interpretation of the great ""Art of the Fugue"" here is sometimes poetic; the sound is nice, not excellent, and often the Author falls into something ridicolous, such as too much staccato at the end of Contrapuncto I after a lot of well balanced phrasings; or when he marks each theme with a lot of flourishes which have no sense in piano music, above all in the Disklavier music, etc.But the biggest mistake is to compare these ""performances"" with the Glenn Gould ones (see from the web). Also these are too metrical, too sequenced, too false. Sorry; and Gould was not a machine as the Author thinks."
2,Belongs in every critical thinker's library,I disagree with the previous reviewer's comments that the book is largely of use to the legal professioin. I find the law case serves as a great backdrop to understanding science and judging scientific claims. Many great principles are explained in this book.
1,Nothing New,"This movie was nothing that we haven't already seen with Hide and Seek or Secret Window. This was an unoriginal, predictable, below average film."
2,I only wish there were more...,"Shame on A&E; for canceling this excellent series! With the talent of Hutton, Chaylkin and the revolving set of strong character actors this was one of the best shows on television. Although the core characters (Wolfe, Goodwin, Fritz, Kramer, etc...) were consistently played by the same actors, the varying supporting characters were played by a revolving cast of actors. This meant that the client of one episode might be the villain in the next. Although some have complained that this was confusing, I think that it was an original idea that worked quite well. In fact, it reminded me of an acting troupe that would change roles for each stage play.IF you are a fan of the original Rex Stout novels, you will love these shows. The characters, dialogue, and general feel of the series is faithful to the original stories. Conversely, if you enjoy the show you will enjoy the books which are very similar."
2,"Riveting, and very emotional...a real gem!!!!","A rather complex bible story (there is nothing ""linear"" about the life and work of Moses) made simple, stunning and very emotional. This movie is a rhapsody of visual delights and beautiful music. It is a treat for all your senses!No doubt this will be a classic.Highly recommended.Cris"
2,"Just as described, basic and a-ok!",This item is just as described and it works perfectly in the toilet room in the space between the toilet and wall. Good gift for Dad!
2,Works great with Zaurus,"I wanted a CompactFlash Ethernet card for my Sharp Zaurus (the SL-5500), and this was the cheapest one I could find. It wasn't listed on Sharp's compatibility list, but I saw someone online had mentioned that it had worked for them, so I gave it a try. Plugged it in, configured it in Network & Sync, and it worked right away. (This isn't actually surprising, of course; CompactFlash is just miniaturized PCMCIA, and Linux has great PCMCIA Ethernet support.) Makes a huge difference in installing software; I can use the ""Install from Network"" button in ""Add/Remove Software"" to download from package feeds, or use the browser to download package files that aren't available in feeds.This is with version 2.0.37 of the Zaurus ROM, the one that came preinstalled.Now if only I can convince my wife to let me put an Ethernet drop in the bedroom. :-)"
1,Steel 4.5mm Screwdriver Security Bit Open SNES,Item shorter than the screwdriver in the picture. Started to strip screws on my SNES. Stopped as soon as that happened and now I have to find another screwdriver to replace this product. Got what I paid for. :( Lesson learned and moving on.
2,Holes Louis Sachar,"I would recommened this book to a friend, because it is easy to understand and it is a very good book for teens to rea. It's about a boy named Stanley Yelnats and he is under a curse that began all because his great great grandfather. He gets sent to Camp Green Lake because he was accused of stealin sweet feet shoe's from a shelter home. He notices that at camp their not digging holes to build character but to also help the warden look for somthing and he tries to dig up the truth in this humorous tale.huda@dhs"
1,Ridiculous,"This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from. Fossils exists don't they? So there's proof of my alien theory. It makes just as much sense as ""intelligent design"". Hey, the aliens were the ""intelligent designers"". That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too."
1,nothing new here,"Lose weight, stop smoking, drinking, coffee, become a veggie, yadda yadda. Nothing interesting or new here. I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
1,Not so much,"really the game just isn't all that great to begin with. So when thy come out with the remake of the it and then add somemore levels and better graphics, you might think it is good? Wrong."
1,Last House on the Left,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, the storyline unbelievable and the production values zero!! Save your money!!"
2,Consumer Reports Correction,"Another reviewer said: ""Consumer Reports who compared Bose with other products that it sued (and lost)""Bose won... the ruling said: ""The District Court found that Consumer Reports ""had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard..."". The ruling was later overturned only because the higher court did not find ""actual malice"". [In short the courts agree with Bose but didn't award any money because there was no proof that Consumer Reports did the report to be mean.]Reviewers don't like to be sued. Every since the law suit, reviewer tend to be bias against Bose.With that said... Bose aren't worth the retail price but are great speakers when you can get them on sale."
1,"""Ecco the Dolphin"" Sinks","This game has great graphics, great underwater AI, and Ecco is just like a real dolphin, but this game is TOO puzzling. I only managed to get past the first level. I regret buying it. Don't buy it."
2,Was Great Series,"This was a great series, Great Acting and and a very good Script. It kept you interested , Should have never been cancelled."
2,Best book light out there,This one is by far the best book light out there. I read every night and the batteries need replacing about once a month.
1,junk,"Small amount of rain collapsed side, stretched awning and bent legs. I bought the name brand as I thought it would be more durable that say a Dick's brand, wrong answer. Not to mention that two feet on each side is not the roof, but where the legs go out too. Total disappointment, total junk. I've owned many canopies, gazebo's and awnings, for the price this was the worse value."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"This album sounds like it was recorded under the worst possible conditions. From what I can hear of the music, I imagine this would have been awesome if it was listenable. It isn't. It sounds as if it was recorded over a telephone wire. Awful awful, awful. ONLY get this after you get all the other VdGG albums. And maybe not even then. I no longer have this one, and I don't plan on re-purchasing this headache. And that's coming from a seasoned VdGG fanatic."
1,MORE LIKE DROOPY EYES,"EVIL EYES is a derivative a la Stephen King/Dean Koontz variety. A failing screenwriter (Adam Baldwin) is approached by a mysterious ""agent"" (Udo Keir) to write the screenplay based on a true story of a screenwriter who went mad and killed his mother, father and wife. As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding. Vague film making at the least."
1,Not the actual poems,This was a critique and write up on the poems on the early poems of Tennyson. I could not actually find the poems I was wanting to read.
1,It isn't a bad guide,I don't have a huge problem with the guide other than that it is not needed. The game is very short and you could beat it in a rental. They aren't any powerup item to miss. I got lost twice and the guide did help me out then but that isn't worth the cost of buying a guide. Go to gamewinners if you stuck instead.
2,Grab this grabber!,"I have had two other grabbers before and this one rocks my world! I just got done with a heavy-duty abdominal surgery where bending is a challenge. This grabber has helped me keep my footing at times (not recommended as a cane, but I have leaned on it a little) and has reached places where other grabbers cannot go.The construction is awesome and the accuracey (preciseness) of this grabber is fantastic. Would I trust it taking a jar off of a shelf? I don't think I would trust any grabber for that. This one is perfect reaching for that kleenex you dropped, keys, cell phone, whatever. It's really a nice grabber.Highly recommended."
2,"The ""Difficult"" period of Steely Dan","Although recorded flawlessly, and with another top notch stable of rock and jazz musicians, the only flaw in this disc is that it failed to break new ground for Fagen and Becker. Also, conside the fact that it was their follow up to Aja. That is a tough act to follow."
2,IT'S NOT A WAR MOVIE!,"If you want to see a war movie then rent one. Also, this is not a documentary. It's a movie, not a factual account of anything. If you don't appreciate Chapter 1 of this movie then you have no appreciation of great acting, brilliant dialogue and great film making. True, a lot of unnecessary gore but gore is always a part of Tarantino's movies and you should expect that before you watch it."
1,"Album is ""burned"" CD-ROM without liner notes","If you purchase this item ""new"" from Amazon, look carefully to see if it's listed as ""manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" The CD itself will be a greenish ""burned"" CD-ROM, not a standard factory-made CD. The burned CD-ROM bears only a generic ""Naxos"" label on it without any identifying album name! And worst of all, there are NO liner notes - none of the excellent scholarly Naxos liner notes that I have come to expect when purchasing their other classical albums. Caveat emptor!"
2,Best Bond since Goldeneye,"Agent Under Fire is the first playable Bond game since the groundbreaking Goldeneye. Although I like the N 64 controls much better, and I really wish I could make cumstom controls for AUF (there are several controller settings, but none of them are what I would like), this game still manages to beat out the laughable games of ""The World is Not Enough"" and ""Tomarrow Never Dies"".I have yet to decide if this game is better than Timesplitters. Mainly because I have not yet had the chance to play multi-player against anyone other than my 12 year old brother (he's good, but not that good). But the single player is deffinately better than Timesplitters, and although different, ranks up there with Red Factions single player."
1,Maybe later...,My 14 month old LOVES sesame street and doesn't like this video. She actually opens the DVD player and throws the DVD whenever I play it!
1,stay away,"i have purchased 4 or 5 recordings all blu ray from this manufacturer (they go by two names that i am aware of ) all had terrable audio, most did not play at all, most were returned .. this is the only review i have ever written guess i should write a review of the many very fine recordings i have purchased probably more than 75 are blu ray format"
1,Not that great,The case has a nice tight fit. Almost too tight. If you ever need to get it off - you will struggle. The main complaint I have with the case is the plastic that covers the front face is so tight that it makes bubbles on top of the phone's plastic front - making it difficult to read. The thumbwheel is also hard to use when in the case.I don't think this case would be much protection if you were to drop it either.Overall I think there are better case options for this phone.
2,Got me off the couch,I had seen some country clogg dancing and thought it was wounderful. So I decided to start my self. Very good dvd to get you stared with the basics.
2,I've NEVER read a BAD book by Nicholas Sparks !!! He's AWESOME !!!!!!,I've NEVER read a BAD book by Nicholas Sparks... I finally purchased about 6 of his books... I could NEVER get them at the library... they were ALWAYS out.... Now my friends can read them once I'm finished reading them :) GREAT reading !!!!
1,Not a do it yourself guide,"This book is good for parents of kids who are new to or in speech therapy but, it's not a do it yourself guide. I was hoping to, teach my child how to say it right. This book gives some background and helps a tiny bit but, it didn't help in the least with teaching my daughter how to say her ""r"" sounds properly. On the speech therapy I go. Save the 10$ to apply to your deductible unless you just really want to learn more about speech problems."
1,What's the point,"There is an occasional insight here, but ultimately this book is embarassing. You know that horrible scene in Bittersweet Motel with the two guys sitting talking about the difference between girls who ride in the jeeps and girls who ride in the microbuses? Imagine if those people went on tour and wrote a book about it."
2,little miss sure shot,"i enjoy American experience series about characters like Annie,Mary picford,F.D.R. Rockefeller's a lot of persona's you were interested in but never had time to research are presented well in this program and when i was a kid i had such a crush on little miss Oakley after seeing the movie with barbara stanwyck another fave .the series is still being produced and on the older episodes you hear the beautiful musical theme witch cannot be purchased believe me I've tried"
2,"If your hard core furry fan, you'll like this",An excelent book with plenty of worth while pictures in it. but it is not 100% furry though with two of the artists not having a single furry pic in their section
2,Pure psycho-noir,"This one surprised the hell out of me. At first, it seems to be a rather typical P.I. story, featuring a stalwart hero with an overdeveloped sense of justice a la Mike Hammer. But slowly, over the first half of the book, Zeltserman starts revealing ugly little bits of the ""hero""'s psychosis... and by the time you're halfway through FAST LANE you begin to realize you're reading about a real messed-up bastard. As it all plays out toward the inevitable end and Johnny Lane's predicament gets worse and worse, you almost want to cover your eyes. This is pure psycho-noir here, expertly told, as if Jim Thompson or Charles Willeford had taken a stab at a Mike Shayne type novel. Beautiful and terrible."
2,The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,This was a great book! Great for a little comic relief sometimes.
1,Drowned in Detail without Insight,"Despite all the hoopla, this is a bad, bad book, which reads as if two dozen researchers had gathered every scrap of information on the first part of this century and then the most unimaginative of writers had just put them in chronological order and called it a history."
2,Do Not Read the Editorial Review,"Do not read the above editiorial review if you want to fully appreciate this film, as it gives away the plot. Ed Harris plays an American spy, Gus Lang. He works for both the British and Germans during the period immediately before DDAY. He is sent to Paris where a young but brilliant American officer, one of a handful of allied soldiers who knows the actual DDay plans, has been captured and is being interrogated by the Germans. The Allies direct Lang to prevent the young American from talking. The Germans use Lang to try coercing the American to reveal the Allies DDay plans. The fun of this movie revolves around not knowing Gus Lang's real intentions. Add the fact that one of the German officers involved in the interogation is working for the Allies, but which one? This is a smart, well written script, with strong characters by a fine cast."
1,"Should be called ""Advertisements for Kids"" ... where is the Geography?","I ordered this magazine for my son expecting the same level of quality articles as National Geographic Magazine has but, written at a kids level. After seeing two issues full of advertisements pushing things like: junk food, Video Games and Movies and even a review of video games, I am cancelling the subscription. This magazine is very disappointing and not at all up to expectations. All parents should cancel and send a message to the owners of this junk magazine that is doing nothing more than pushing advertising on our kids. Stick to a high quality magazine like National Wildlife's Ranger Rick."
1,Noise Noise Noiise,"Purchased this 4port after using the 2 port for a long time. However, I can't even use the audio jacks because it creates a high pitch sound that irritates and won't go away. It is in the box itself. While this is enough to negate the function of the audio plugs, to add to this problem the kvm apparently still passes noise coming from some peripheral that wasn't there before. I am going back to my 2 port and just deal with the physical changing of cables."
1,These do not work on candy melts (for Cake Pops),"I should have read the reviews on here before purchasing but I assumed it would work on another Wilton product (the candy melts). It does not and now my ""spooky"" eyeball cake pops will just have to be regular eyes. I can't believe I wasted almost ten bucks on these markers."
2,The definitive Sherlock Holmes,Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes. The Granada series is a collector item and I recommend it to Conan Doyle fans everywhere.
1,Worthless,"I've had two sets of Memorex DVD-R discs and no matter what they last a year at best, burned or not. Save yourself alot of headaches and spend an extra $5 dollars on another brand that actually works."
2,A Feel Good Movie....,"What a great film! Stars Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown. You keep a steady grin throughout the first half of the movie. From catching the bus to NYC, to going to class with young Flanagan, through looking for work on Wall Street, and then finally meeting Coughlin. Later, a 25-year old Shue appears. What a great young woman! She's smart, fun, good sense of humor, and of course, very pretty. Any guy would be lucky to meet her (Oh yeah, we find out later that she's an original ""rich chick"").You'll love the scenes of the old New York skyline and the beautifully breath-taking beaches of Jamaica, mon. A classic movie that everyone should watch and enjoy. Good songs and memorable quotes throughout as well."
1,"I COULDN'T GIVE ""0"" STARS","THE ""ANTIQUE BRONZE"" IS BROWN PAINT. THE ARMS PLASTIC. ONE SNAPPED RIGHT OFF. IT WENT RIGHT BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD HOWEVER, THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT."
1,Could not stick with this one....,"This movie was not funny in the least...boring, stupid, and in some spots down right vulgar....do not let you kids watch this movie if they are under 16....IMHO!!!"
1,L is more like an XL,the mountain's shirt sizes are not accurate but their artwork is amazing. 8 more words required to post this review
1,Blatant Attempt to Cash in on Reader Interest,"What a waste of money and time. Couldn't even finish it...flat characters, dumb plot. Written just for ""jolt value""."
2,"Little known album, yet one of the greatest of the 80's","I was shopping at a record store in the 80's and saw this album in the dollar bin. It looked kinda cool, and even though I never heard of The Headpins, I bought it. Probably the best dollar I ever spent. This has to be one of the greatest 80's rock albums made. Tight musically, well arranged, and Darby Mills' sexy vocals make this one a must have. I wore out the album in the 80's, wore out a tape, and am trying to wear out my CD right now. Do yourself a favor and listen to the best thing to come out of Canada ... you won't regret it."
2,disney movie,"It is a good quality movie, arrived fast and is what was expected. Love the movie and so do my children. Good time to buy while the price is down, before it goes into the vault."
1,Save Your Money,"I played it one time and threw it away. This is not traditional ""honky tonk"" as most of us understand it. The style is a kind of ""herky-jerky"", improv version of all of the old songs.---not the way they were written. It's not the Johnney Maddox that I was familiar with."
2,American Orthodoxy is greatly indebted to Fr. Seraphim,"While so many Orthodox theologians in Fr. Seraphim's day were writing left-leaning works that looked as though they had come from Vatican II, monk Seraphim was earnestly laboring to bequeath to the tiny American Orthodox flock the rich patristic inheritance of the Church.The Soul After Death's chapters upon the tollhouses contains large quotations of St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Macarius of Egypt, St. Leo of Rome, and St. Mark of Ephesus. Those who slander Fr. Seraphim and these teachings are usually from the school of one Mr. Puhalo, who deeply resented Fr. Seraphim's vast influence upon Orthodox Christians of America, Russia, Greece, and elsewhere.Fr. Seraphim was a great luminary of the Orthodox Church who truly struggled for Orthodoxy. You will not be disappointed with this easily readable, insightful volume."
2,Works,Used it in a Cajon Drum I built. Worked great and not much money. Just wish it was super saver shipping eligable. As for all things from Mucisian's Friend.
2,Very helpful during a stressful time,"I bought this CD for my cats for Christmas. During the holidays one of my cats began losing her battle with heart disease. We basically hospiced her until she died peacefully. This CD seemed to really calm her and the rest of the cats (as well as me). Once I began playing it for her, she seemed more relaxed and comfortable. It helped us all out during a rough time. I play it still for my other cats who really do seem to listen. If you have a cat, you should give this a try. The music is all very beautiful and well performed."
2,Prefer it to the replacement bought last year,"We purchased the special unit (with the metal frame) and found it to be too narrow. This one, at considerably less cost, fills the space and seems to be doing a much better job."
2,WOW!!!! - fresh,"awsome, includes two different styles, ""stimulant DJ's"" and ""superfast OZ"" ....i do not OWN a mix better than this 2 hours of kicking, drum rolling HARD HOUSE....ONE of the best CD's i have ever balsted at a party.....still trying to get a hold of(volume: 1 3 and 4), damn tidy trax had to set up in the UK!!!"
1,Doesn't arrive in one piece,I order this shovel and had to ask for a replacement twice. Each time the shovel arrived with a broken handle. I gave up and ask for a refund. Can't say how good it works because I never got a chance to use it.
2,This cartoon rocks!,"This is a cartoon about four planets (fire, rock, ice and bone) coming together as one to defend their solar system against the beast planet. This cartoon has great animation and action."
1,Horror Remakes Suck,"The original Night/Demons was a classic 80's horror film. The 2010 Demons is a steaming pile of horse pucky. I really don't even know where to start with this muddled mess. But I'll try...1. Shannon Elizabeth as Angela, really?2. Eddie Furlong looks like a bloated reject from Fraggle Rock3. The most un-erotic lesbian make out scenes ever4. CGI that looked good in 1997on the plus side I liked the soundtrackAvoid at all costs"
2,Smith's Genius,"Elliot Smith has never written anything but beautiful, listenable music and this first release is no exception. His fan base should only grow. He was a genius."
2,This book can answer all your fertility questions!,"I have been telling my family and friends that my husband and I have been actively trying to conceive for 5 months. Well...after reading this book (I read it cover to cover in 2 days, by the way!) I realized that we really had not even begun to try! As educated as I thought I was and as knowledgeable as I thought I was about my body, I didn't know NEARLY enough about conceiving until I read this book! I am so happy... not just because I KNOW it will help me conceive but because I now know all about my body! This is not a book for those people looking for gimmicks, tricks or old wives tales. This book simply teaches you about your body so you will have everything you need to get pregnant (or avoid pregnancy). My husband and I loved it and we will continue to refer to it as we try to conceive our first child...something tells me it won't take long now! Thanks Toni!"
2,Subtle Charmer,"Okay, it took a while for this album to grow on me, but wow! once it did, it simply knocked me out! The album is a bit on the long side (over an hour) but weaves in psychedelia, reggae, electronica, classical, funk, avant-garde, and personal politics all into a kaleidescope of colors and tones that will have you humming at the most unusual times of day. After a few listens, you will very likely find yourself actually relaxing more each time you listen. They may not get the press of groups like air, but they have easily as much talent..."
2,Cheap and versatile - this thing is cool!,"What a great little addition to my lenses.IT doesn;t have the best optics, the bag and caps are crap, and it's hard to thread onto my lens, but I'd expect that kind of cheapness from this price point.But the pics I can take with it are really cool! I bring it to all my informal events because it makes the party more fun. Zoom into someone's nose and take a pic. You'll laugh, and so will they. Kids love this thing.Take pictures of dogs, also. They're awesome.The lens extension clipped on my 20D when I had it zoomed all the way out. I have not tested it in my 5D yet.It's cheap. Go ahead and get it! You won;t use it much. But when you do, you'll like it."
1,probably nothing but garbage,"this is what the idiots in hollywood churn out nowadays. Mindless fodder for mindless numbskulls....vampires are nice people, and you want to be in love with them.........NOT!!!! If memory serves, vampires are ""MONSTERS"", and want nothing but to kill you and drink your damn blood!!! That's why I laugh at this moronic, mindless crap turned out by hollywood........MAKES ME SICK!!!"
2,Love this Show,I always loved The Pretender and Micheal T Weiss. I was not disappointed in buying the DVD series and rewatching them. If you loved this show when it was on the air you will love it on DVD.
2,See this movie,"Everyone should see this movie. I saw the cover and waited to purchase as it is not what I gravitate toward, but saw it and passed it on to many to watch. I see why it had everyone talking and being shown everywhere. We need more movies like this today. Thank you, Alex Kendrick and crew!"
1,"Promising title, disappointing DVD.","First, the technicalities. The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows.Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie."
2,"""Mac Not Afraid To Venture""","Word Of Mouth is not your typical Mac McAnally recording but when you think about it what IS a typical Mac McAnally recording? It is almost impossible to categorize Mac's music and that is what makes him so interesting. His willingness to venture into new unexplored fields is so refreshing and welcome. I'm sure that the fans of Mac's earliest recordings will be quite surprised at ""Word Of Mouth"" but give it a chance before writing it off. Mac's songwriting skills are again the highlight of the project and his warm, friendly voice always brings a smile. Be sure to pick up a copy and remember that on July 27 Mac's first two albums will be released on CD for the first time. Well worth the 20 year wait!"
1,A Nice Table if you could assemble it,"The finish and design are nice, but it was impossible to assemble the shelves. The grooves to insert the wood into were machined too narrow. After returning the item to Toys-R-Us, the manager informed me that he had seen 3 of these come back for the same reason. He said he had even tried to help someone else assemble it with a hammer and sand paper with no luck! Maybe they got a bad batch? I'd stay away anyhow."
1,I Am Not,"Really quite awful. Mostly it got my attention because it incorporates music from various of John Adams' orchestral compositions. Now that I have sat through this bland drama, I am shocked that the composer consented to this appropriation. And the torrent of praise given this film, from even our most insightful professional critics, confirms simply that a tale about a woman who feels trapped but escapes in the end will milk, without fail, any faux-progressive's heart (like auditing coursework from a women's studies program). This is basically a second-rate revival of Tilda Swinton's early feminist film ""Orlando"" in a rather different era and with much less subtlety. The cinematography aspires toward epic luxury but basically conveys a lazy, digital aesthetic with awkward coverage shots and uninventive tracking shots. As a low-budget film, ""I Am Love"" needn't have bothered trying to look like a vintage studio picture, admitting ""I Am Not."""
2,What Marcel saw,"Maybe has-been harlots of the Belle Epoque affected, entre elles-memes, the wit of Wilde characters, which American actors render under direction in fleeting Hollywood Edwardian. The accents come and go chasing the screenplay's segues first to Colette's very different style and then to more modern takes on women's wares and tears, all to dress up and down what two people are deciding nobility obliges. Together Hampton, Frears and Friend keep the tale's surprise. While Lea has been no nanny but doubly nude throughout, a delicately draped performance by Pfeiffer, Friend's dandy shows himself, in retrospect, the moralist at his wit's end. The only touch missing is a real picture of Kathy Bates when she was an ingenue of the first water, as her character in the corps de ballet."
1,Poorly made (didn't last a week!),I received these as a Christmas present and they didn't even last a week. They came unsewn at the seams around the toe area on both slippers. It is obvious they are very poorly made. I would defintely not recommend these.
1,Missing Product ID Code... Could be Fake,The box appeared to have been resealed. The unique product code on the inside of the box has been removed. There is no way to verify that this is not a fake... DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON
2,Keyspan Presentation Tool,I am a very avid technology user and science teacher. My students are involved with many professional presentations and I am a lead teacher and mentor for many proffessional teacher groups. My students and I believe this is the easiest preentation tool we have found. It is rock solid. I beieve in Apple computers and this is the only presentation tool that works with Apple products right out of the box. I have purchased three of these gems. Two were used by first year teachers without any training.Best buy in a presentation tool.
1,Keep looking,"I am transitioning to tailwheel aircraft, so I am devouring all relevant information. I thought I would love the book, but it was average at best. A real disappointment, especially considering the price."
2,V-1 Flying Bomb,"This book deals with the V-1 Flying Bomb,from its inception,its development,and its strugle to become an operational weapon of terror.This is a very short paged book with excellent color diagrams and period b/w photos;a good introductory book."
2,Arrived fast and as promised in excellant condition.,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift, and it came very quickly and in excellant condition, as it was advertised."
1,One star for special effects...,"Great specials effects, decent direction, OK acting but (and this is important I think) no plot."
1,Ship of foolishness.,"I just don't get it. The production team behind DARK CASTLE films are reputable movie makers, however, so far all three of their flicks fail to do anything but produce lots of eye rolling. As with HOUSE ON HAUNTD HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS, GHOST SHIP starts out great, then falters. Great production values and decent premises are there, but all three films progress into either the absurd, or are just muttled by a confused plot or lack there of. Lowest common denominator movie watching especially for fans of the genere. Pretty much before GHOST SHIP left port, it sunk."
1,just a box,My daughter was so happy to get this but when we pulled it out of the box it was just that a BOX - No cords etc..
2,Ever wonder....,Where some sitcoms shows you watch today get their ideas? Watch this show. The stars as well as the supporting cast give lessons on how to be funny!!!!!
1,Boring and potentially dangerous.,"What is the fascination with fasting, in the u.s. especially? How about a properly balanced diet with exercise than trying to fix things asap in the easiest way possible. I was waiting for Ron Popiel to jump out at the end with a special offer on a juicer. Not inspiring to anyone with common sense. Sorry, but drinking juice is not a magic cure-all. Stop stuffing your face with burgers and corn syrup and exercise once in a while."
2,Great blu ray movie,"Awesome price, fast shipping, A great way to expand your collection without going broke. Awesome internet seller! A++ Thank you"
2,Only thing my rabbit eats,"Only food my rabbit will eat consistently. They stopped selling it at the local stores. Glad I knew I could order it online!Tried to switch him to a new food, one with more seeds and what not, he didn't like it at all.When I switched him back to this food he wouldn't eat the brown pellets for a month or so...Now he eats them all again."
2,Just for the fun of it.,"Whereas Jake Shimabukuro is a master at showing what a uke can do using shock and awe, Gerald Ross shows what a uke should do by playing very pleasurable music."
2,Best Price Router,I have shopped locally but can't match the price I paid for this router. Reviews have been very good. I believe it is what I need to fabricate and install new kitchen cabinet doors and plan to use it soon.
2,I Dreamed of Africa-- a review,"This book is the type of rare work that draws its readers into a whole other world by making them see and feel everything that the storyteller does. We become almost a part of the life of this extraordinary woman and her passion not only for Kenya and Africa but simply for life and living. Each one of us dreams of some place or ideal as we grow, but few of us are fortunate or determined enough to turn those dreams into realities and go on to live them. Kuki Gallman along with her husband and children shows us what it is like to achieve and live our dreams and at what cost our dreams sometimes come. ""I Dreamed of Africa"" is a lyrical, magical account of one woman, her family, and the people and customs of the last continent in our world that truly has a soul. The message of this book and Kuki's continuing mission to preserve that world will stay with all who read it and they will be better for it."
1,Leaking,"Like some others, I had a leaking problem on install. It doesn't seem to be a great design, the parts don't seem to quite line up correctly. After playing with it for a while I did manage to get it to work with only a very minimal leak, but after reading some other reviews here I might go back and try some of their ideas. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone though, a shower-head should be a very easy thing to install without any problems like this one seems to have. I'm no expert but I've installed shower heads, faucets, toilets, kitchen sinks and a few other things around the house, this one should have been a 5 minute job."
1,I lost another 85 minutes of my life,"What's the point of this film? A girl trying to find out the meaning of love and pretending it's a documentary. So what. I think Charlyne Yi is the only thing decent about Paper Heart. She is funny in an adorable kind of way, but even her ""performance"" wears thin over 85 minutes. The movie description didn't really interest me, so I knew I was taking a chance going in. I was hoping for a nice surprise and I ended up just waiting for it to be over. It's not all bad, but the good moments are few and very far between. Oh, Michael Cera in real life acts the same as M.C. in every movie he does. What a range."
1,very disappointed,"My 89 year old mother loves Claude King's Wolverton Mountain. Hasspecial memories for her from 1961. So I was pleased to see it here with some other good country hits. I didn't realize I was getting a tape, thought I was getting a CD but that was my fault for not paying attention.What wasn't my fault, however, was I thought I was getting the original recordings but they are all remakes. They're awful. I think they should put that in BOLD LETTERS-REMAKE! Don't waste your money."
2,One of the Greatest Films Ever,"talk about a film that brings it from start to finish? also the supporting Cast was on point.the pacing of the film,style&feel ruled the way that films in the years to come where made to appear.this film is timeless&just gets fresher with every new viewing."
1,i hella love hyphy,"and this aint it. on a jazz rating this gets deez nuts. so cereal. its subpar wack jazz at it's crapyist. and making hip hop digestible for non hip hop audiences? don't listen to hip hop if you dont like hip hop. hip hop sampling is nothing like these garbage guitars and keyboards over a beat and hook. and if you don't have the musical intelligence to understand that... then i have a pair of kenny g tickets for you.im not intending to be defamatory according to the review guidelines.. but im calling it like i see it. from someone who has little jon next to the john coletrane and duke ellington album recorded on impulse! in his record crate. (read: records, vinyl, albums, LPs)ps, i think i got jipped out of the one star i was forced to rate this."
1,Confused Ending,"The ending was so bad I felt insulted. The first 80% of the book was a 3-star. I am a chronic reader, so I read a 3-star without complaining. When the surprised ending was revealed, it was like walking into a brick wall. The surprise was bad, but the chapters after the surprise were worse."
1,One Star is TOO much,"I gave this book one star because zero wasn't available.Anne Rice has always been marvelous at drawing mental pictures for me as I read her books. This one drew mental blanks.Actually, the story line is very good. The ghost, the history, the intertwining stories of the Russian prince and the New Orleans Socialite were intriguing. But the excess of words! Rice's flowery writing has always caused her stories to soar. In this one, the prose was a boat anchor. For a while, I reread every paragraph trying to figure out what she had said, but finally gave up. I had to force myself to finish it."
1,Derivative with subtle homophobia,"It isn't even that much of the elements have been done before by better writers. Or that the few original ideas don't logically track. It's that the author runs a subtle but nonetheless disturbing homophobia through all three novels.(Every time there's any hint whatsoever of some ambiguous character, this person is always repugnant) And yet she seems to have no problems whatsoever with rampant incest. Disturbing."
1,Failed within a few days,"The unit stopped chirping within a few days. Fresh batteries did not revive it. Willing to try another, but there seems to be a quality control problem."
2,Great Kind of mushy but ..... it is Great,"IT is a pretty good book .I am only ten but I think it is too mushy and gushy it is easy to read for me .which is about sixth grade level if you think that death and kissing and all that this is the book for you it talks all about the wakefeild twins history and the same family name falls in this book three times the first time Alice and Theodore wakefeild, amanda and Ted wakefield , and alice,and Ned wakefield. This is the First Sweet Valley book that took memore than an hour to read"
1,trite and predictable,"This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and guessed the plotline from the bookjacket summary... not surprisingly, I guessed correctly a very predictable storyline. Though love-obsession is a scary situation to be in, Sparks' writing did not make me feel compassion or empathy for protagonist Julie. I found all of the characters to be very shallow and not well-developed, mostly stereotypical.Sparks' writing style is clean but uninspired, filled with stock phrases and a bland rhythm (the shouts aren't shouts, the italicized thoughts don't have any weight). Hope that standard writing formula isn't prevalent through all of his books, if I should ever read another book of his again."
2,Excellent camera,I have had the c-5060 for almost a year and am very happy with the camera. The wide-angle lens is great for landscape photos. I find that the amount of post-processing I need to do with photos from this camera is minimal. Sharpness is always good right off the camera. It also handles contrasty scenes very well and doesn't overexpose as much as other cameras I have owned.
1,"Snoozle, no way! I like the Bumpil pillow and baby play combo.","I had a snoozle for two days and returned it. It was a pain to get comfortable with. It was like a tube that needed flattening. My mother bought me a bumpil from this little boutique downtown and paid about the same amount that I paid for my snoozle. This pregnancy pillow is awesome because it is so easy to get comfortable with and when baby gets here in just a few days, he can also enjoy the pillow because it opens up to a baby play area. Just My Opinion."
2,Well Made Product,This item was exactly as advertised. It is a well made and accurate measuring tool. A must for any upper extremity surgeon. It was shipped quickly and at a very good price.
1,"OK she's funny, but very cynical & dangerously inaccurate.","This book is clever and after four births (everything from being knocked out to completely natural childbirth) I admit I recognized most of the experiences she describes. However, anyone with girlfriends like this should get birthing advice from somewhere else. Few women ever have a chance to do anything even half so important as giving birth to a child and they deserve far better support and advice than they get in this book. They should get the Birth Book by William and Martha Sears. Cynicism does not enhance a beautiful experience."
2,Good book,Good book funny lines I can't wait to tell you guys how good the second book will be with the power of the juniors.
2,Very informative,This book is excellent. It presents a very good overview of how to run a small corporation in a manner that will keep the IRS happy. Very thought provoking.
2,Addictive,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsI was so happy to find this game, it is one of the only 3 harry potter games available for mac. I literally couldn't stop playing it until i finished. The graphics are pretty good, and the storyline is fairly interesting. It is definitely an improvement on harry potter and the sorcerer's stone game!"
1,Short-lived,"Total disappointment! Initially, it worked great. 4 months later, dead in the water! Talk about built-in obsolescence! $45 dollars X 135 days = stealing!"
2,Best dog & cat brush you can buy.,"I have 5 dogs and 2 cats which generates a whole lot of pet hair! The FURminator is very effective in removing the undercoat and helps to eliminate shedding. I highly recommend it, and you will be amazed at how much hair you get after brushing your pets!"
2,"Ignor the ""philosophizing""","I'm a long time Gabriel fan. But before purchasing this title I read a bunch of reviews to get an idea of what to expect. There's an awful lot of ""philosophizing"" about you have to listen to this CD half a dozen times before you get it. After that, you'll love it. Based on some reader comments and listening to the samples, I was expecting a bizzar and interesting new Gabriel album--but tough to listen to. Well, the first listening for me was fantastic and not abstract nor strange at all. If you enjoy any of Gabriel's albums, you'll love this one just as much--at least I did."
2,happy,"initially i was disappointed because the rings appeared larger online, however i am satisfied with my purchase. the necklace has a good weight to it and the chain is of pretty high quality- i tend to break stuff and wear this necklace every day! my clients compliment me on it all the time.ignore the other review for this product."
1,Why the perfumy odor?,"These spoons have a nasty perfumy odor. I have to wonder what smell are they trying to hide with that perfume? For myself, I will return these rather than take a chance."
1,Worst movie ever?,I would rather be water-boarded while someone poured hot wax on my nut sack than watch this chunk of poop again.
1,Fun for one season,The kids had lots of fun on it for the first season. Took it out this season and it will not hold air and is coming apart at the seams. I reported this to toyquest.com and am waiting for them to respond.
1,Beware! Amazon is selling an unidentified back level version.,"Six weeks after purchasing US Topo National Parks, I called Garmin technical support with a problem. I was informed the version 2 sold to me by Amazon had been upgraded to version 3 in April 2006. Garmin also said they would not upgrade my software to version 3 because I had not paid the MSRP. Since it was over 30 days, Amazon does not provide an return option or upgrade to make this right.With other Garmin products on Amazon's web pages, it is stated that there is a more recent version of the product. This is not the case with Amazon's webpage for the US Topo National Parks. The web page does not identify the version of the mapping software.Buyer Beware !! Amazon is selling a back level version of this mapping software."
1,this book made me cry,I had originally bought this with two other books.The other two being Meg and The Trench.I read this book first and it was just a disgrace to the shark itself.Besides switching scenes every other sentence the author treated the shark as nothing but a soulless beast. i read up to the last five pages and couldnt bring myself to even finish the book because it was so bad. Stick with Steve Alten
2,My review,I like the story of Les Mis It is a classic story and a good one. I have never read the book.
1,Gigantic : the story of the author's ego (0 stars),"This is the worst biography ever published. The author is not clever or witty as i'm sure he believes himself to be. (he refers to himself as ""Gigantic"" in the 3rd person; what else needs to be said?) Clever if you consider that he's probably making money from the sale of this book on the strength of a great subject (pixies) and a cool cover. In addition to having no interviews with the band that weren't lifted from other sources, half of the book isn't even about the pixies. Every other chapter of this book is a short fictional work about a fan who becomes obsessed with Charles Thompson (Frank Black). This is just a cheap bait & switch to increase the thickness of the book and make it appear as if the author actually has something worth saying. Trust me no pixie fan, no matter how huge, could possibly find anything of value in this book."
2,"Informative, Well Wrtiien and Documented","If you are a genealogist and have ancestors in North Carolina in the mid 1700's, you have to own this book! This is more about the inhabitants that settled the region and not a dry history of the area.I found wonderful information on both my paternal and maternal lines. I had no idea that both sides of my family were living next to each other and attending the same church.This is a must have for anyone doing genealogy in early North Carolina."
2,What fun!,"At Christmas I found all sorts of fun and useful food gifts to make from this book. Homemade liqueurs, jellies...If you like to cook and hate all the extra ingredients in processed foods, this one's a keeper."
1,Hornet Flight,"It's hard to believe Ken Follett could write a book this amateurish. It reads more like his first rather than his latest. The sentences are simple; basic statements are explained; the situations rather simplistic. The storyline is credible; the characters are not...much too naive. It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote The Eye of the Needle; The Key to Rebecca; The Pillars of the Earth (which I loved) and many other really fine books.If you must read it, check it out at the library and save your money for his next book. Hopefully, he'll return to his former style."
2,A great CD.,"First of all, I just read a review of this on this site that said ""Manson is so obviously gay, just look at the cover"" oh well gee what kind of, (I can't say anything bad here can I) piece of trash are you. He's into gay, and if he were why would it matter. Nor does he worship Satan, just becasue he hates Christianity does NOT NOT NOT mean that he worships Satan. Now onto the music, I think this is one of his best albums. I don't blame him for going more pop, and changing himself considering he had a nervous breakdown after the making of Antichrist Superstar. One would think that The Dope Show and I don't Like The drugs are the best songs since they are th single, but I don't think so. Buy the album and you won't be sorry, maybe he isn't being to to true to his real goth obbsessed fans but like I said if he kept going in the direction he was he'd be dead by now probably."
1,THESE SUCK,"EASY SET UP, WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. NOW WILL NOT WORK WITH REMOTE CONTROL MORE THAN 4' FROM TRANSCEIVER, EVEN WITH NEW BATT. IN REMOTE. TOO BAD, NICE SET UP IF THEY WORKED. WILL RETURN THIS SET.OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS FOR THOSE PAST RETURN/WARRANTY DATE."
2,"i heard it,..but uhh where are the song titles","it was an outstanding cd, i personality wish i had my own copy of it, well i really enjoyed it so keep up the good work"
2,Tranquility System offers valuable advice for modern living,"Having worked in a fast-paced, high stress environment, I quickly learned the importance the stress relief. The Tranquility System was an invaluable guide to me in my quest for relaxation. It is filled with useful tips on how to relax even when you are in a stressful situation (which of course is when you really need it) and how to incorporate stress relief into your daily life. I particularly appreciated the anecdotes the authors share about the individuals they have worked with, as they personalize the damaging effects stress can have on our relationships with others, and on our own spirits. The relaxation techniques outlined by Forest and Light are clearly explained and easy to practice. This book has taught me that it is possible to achieve a sense of inner peace no matter how chaotic my environment - I highly recommend it."
1,Doesn't work in stereo mode.,Bought this for my cell phone so I can have hands free and stereo mp3 access. The first one didn't work in stereo just mono. The company promptly sent me another one ( didn't want he broke one back). Got #2 and the same thing was wrong. I tried it in 3 different cell phones and even 2 different 2.5mm house phones with no luck. You get what you pay for but you should get what is advertised ( Stereo ). Company was top notch though.
1,leaky mess,Overall the product looks very nice but it didn't work well. The sealant that keeps the nectar from leaking was not placed right so after you fill the cylinder with nectar it leaked all over the counter. I would not purchase this product if I could go back. Now I need to put more sealant in order for it to work properly. Thumbs down.
1,Terrible,"I'm a huge fan of Katherine Heigl and watched this to see her. I was so disappointed! This movie is so bad that it could literally ruin a good actors career. I like movies that start out good, and this one does that, but it goes downhill so fast after the first 20 minutes that it's barely watchable. I almost quit a few times but wanted to see what happened when she found out that she married a killer. It was ridiculous how quickly she took it all in stride, even though at first she acted like she was going to leave him. Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara are MUCH too good for this flop, too. Don't waste your time.And, all those people who are supposedly ""trained killers""? They certainly are terrible shots! When the lead characters are running out in the wide open with machine guns blasting away at them, they don't even get touched. and yet she hits people with one shot even though she's never shot a gun before? Just plain stupid."
2,"Fascinating approach, could use more meat","I liked the book, I like the approach, but it falls short of what needs to be done to be a truly useful tool for job hunting. As I read it the burning question in my mind was, would What Color Is Your Parachute be a better tool? I actually pulled my two year old copy of Parachute off the shelf and it is a better tool.Still the book deserves a flip through if you have a chance to pull it off your neighbor's shelf or check it out from a library. My favorite chapters were 3 and 4, if there is any chance you might be looking for a job, don't miss those."
2,Love it!!,"fast shipment product exactly as described, would highly recommend this item to all...Fun and very exiting to use and enjoy"
1,No call back (beware),"I bought this board, (post to be new) recived the board gave it to the computer store to install into my system, (old board worked off and on) the store is telling me the board looks like it was used, or some one had tryed it, and the install book pages were looked at you can tell when you look and a new book if some one and looked and it, the pages have been folded open, thats what the computer store told me, there have build me many custom computers, there is not a dout in my mind the boad is bad and the person (guye) or what ever he is call, knew the board was junk, its been a week since I email him, this person is not very responible sell, and should be avoided."
1,not very good at all,not sure what the point of this book was ... not enough details were included to make it at all interesting
1,Don't buy it,"Well, i never write reviews but don't buy this thing. i had a norelco but i broke it. i bought this as a replacement and the battery life is HORRIBLE. fully charged, it didnt even last through one trimming session. by the way, u cant use the cord as a power source. all it does is charge the battery so when its dead u have to wait until it charges some to finish shaving. if i can save a few people from buying it this review was worth writhing. buy a norelco"
1,CASBAH HUMMUS,"AGAIN, KIND OF A DOWNER COMPARED TO THE FANTASTIC FOODS BRAND. I KNOW THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR, BUT SOMETHING IN THE TASTE AND CONSISTENCY IS JUST NOT SPOT ON. LOOK FOR THE ""FANTASTIC FOODS"" BRAND AND DO YOURSELF A FAVOR."
2,Favorite Christmas Movie,We have an old colorized VHS version of this movie and I wanted to upgrade to a DVD. It's the only movie we have watched in which I have seen my husband cry.
1,Disgusting.....,"This book is horrendous! Developmentally speaking, babies need to eat more than 4 times per day, this includes night feedings. Expecting your baby to suffer just so you can get some sleep is purely selfish. You shouldn't have had a baby in the first place if sleep is SOOOOO important to you that you'd be a neglectful parent. Sleeping through the night isn't worth putting your baby through this misery!Read some REAL books that don't glorify child abuse and neglect. This is dangerous advice to follow and I certainly wish I could have rated this with zero stars!"
1,Brother Toner TN 430,Product works properly as supposed to work.Only concern is the yield. Not happy with the yield.Lasted about 1000 pages and now it shows toner low.For 1000 pages of yield I would buy a compatible one forhalf the price.
1,total rehash!,"be warned! the anthology cd is mostly just a compilation album taken from the previous 5 wwe albums. the wwe could have made this cd special, instead we get mostly all theme's that have been released prior to the cd. there are SO many older theme's not present, such as the brutus "" the barber"" beefcake's and what about booker t's wwe entrance theme??? no wcw theme's are present. this album is not worth the time or effort. hopefully the wwe will release a true anthology cd with the rare theme's and wcw theme's. stay away from this one!"
1,requeim from the darkness - turmoil lf the flesh (vol.1) + series box,"this is one of those scams they tell you about. this is one disck. and a box that holds 4 discks. you can buy the only dick in this set for much cheaper and not alot of extra cardboard.so to review, scam scam scam."
1,Disapointed,"Ordered this for my wife as a Christmas present She was excited to watch these with my daughters, but upon closer examination there were two copies of the second movie and no copies of the third."
2,Unbelievably good,"....for several reasons. First, though the main character is a woman, the author is a man - yet you completely believe that a woman is telling this story.Second, Lott's writing style makes it seem as though ""Jewel"" was written in the 1950's - yet, according to the copyright page it was published in 1991. The country was just starting to get into political correctness around that time, and it's hard to believe that a book that uses this sort of language (implied and explicit) could have been written in 1991. But the fact remains that it was - and it's one of the best books I've read so far in 2003.Yes, a good deal of the book is depressing - considering the major plotline it can't help but be depressing. But while not every thread of the story is resolved, there's a lot more positive than negative feelings when you finish the last page.I'm not exactly a fan of Oprah Winfrey's book club, but in ""Jewel"" she picked a winner."
1,cheaply made,It is impossible to purchase these in the store. This is the second time I have had to order one from Amazon. The quality is extremely poor. The handle broke away from the carafe and it is impossible to use it without the top. Krups used to be know for quality now I suggest to look for another brand for espresso!
2,An excellent book which teaches the basics of ventriloquism.,"Have you ever wondered how a ventriloquist can ""throw his voice""? Wonder no more! ""Ventriloquism in a Nutshell"" teaches you the basics of ventriloquism in ten easy to follow lessons. Hillarious illustrations make studying this interesting more even more fun. Plus, Maher Studios entitles anyone who buys this book free help, information, and advice. I've learned ventriloquism from this excellent book... You can too!"
1,The money driven purpose,"Complete and utter pile of religious tosh. The only ""purpose"" this book serves is to line the wallet of Rick Warren. Its repetitive drivel. How to completely enslave your mind to a doctrine. Rick Warren doesnt live in the real world.But like all scam-preachers, the real world to them is how much money can they fleece their audience by. Avoid this book."
1,Lexmark INFO IS MISLEADING!,"This printer is only good for xp/vista. It is on the box as it works for older printes but when you open box, only cd for xp/vista. They advertise a website, but it no longer exist. When contacting Lexmark, It's tough luck, get over it. Advised that Windows won't allow them to support the older version. This is wrong of Lexmark and Windows if this is correct. They should stand up and make things right.. They are the ones who are advertising this incorrectly...... support should be there, as long as, item in still being sold....SHAME SHAME LEXMARK!! I do not support the purchase of Lexmark products.. Lexmark is not doing what's right. Bad customer experience... after hours of searching was able to find on website, but not because of Lexmark.. Thanks to other customers for information.. I appreciate YOU!"
1,Broken Words,"I am familiar with the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition and Sacajawea. I bought this book so that my wife could learn about this brave woman and of the fun of Kindle. Both of us struggled through it. The read was confusing at times. It seemed like the first and second halves were written by different people or at different times. But the worse was the messy formatting of the Kindle book! Spelling errors! Badly placed sentence breaks! ...and more!! There was no editing of the final eVersion whatsoever! It was an extremely bad conversion from print to digital. It was very very distracting to encounter so many format and grammatical errors. I would recommend it only if Amazon cleaned it up and then I might give it 3 stars. As it is, not worth one cent!"
1,I'm sorry I watched it.,"I guess with Steve Carrel in it, I was expecting / hoping for some comedic twist. And, early on, there was some, like the meeting at work, looking to replace suddenly available positions in his company - ""Any one want to be CFO?"" I kept watching hoping for some kind of miraculous turn around, but nope - Earth is vaporized. And two people that finally found love get to share about three minutes. I found it too sad to call entertainment.One redeeming thing - I did find myself thinking about how lucky I am to be with the ones I love."
2,Good,"smallville is one of my favorite shows, so i can't say nothing negative about it.. at least of the top of my head lol. the product came onetime, if i remember correctly i think i did the one-day delivery.. so that was good."
2,Wonderful! Inexpensive.,"I grew tired of the stainless steel gas grill with its unavailable or pricey replacement parts, complicated design that is hard to clean, and wanted to go back to charcoal. I found this grill on sale for about 95 bucks and it is worth every penny. It looks great and has the weight and quality build that should be expected from this type of old school barrel grill. The grill surface is huge so feel free to cook for an army! The real plus is the simplicity of the design and construction. Parts are easy to replace but that probably won't be necessary. A lot of bang for the buck. I found the ash receptacle very easy to clean. It might be awkward for grandma to move around but this is no behemoth that is frightful to negotiate. My grill was already assembled so I cannot speak to the assembly complications of the other reviewer, that said, the design is so simple that I find it hard to believe that it could difficult to do. Enjoy!"
1,Guess I'm not enough Deadhead,"'Cause I just can't ""hear"" this music.Garcia was a musical genius, but maybe this albumis a bit too self absorbed, for certain it's too advanced for me.For others maybe a hit, for me, a big miss."
2,Marshmallow blaster was silly and fun for summer birthday party,"Ordered a couple to have around with other gadgets (water pistols, etc...) for use at a summer birthday party in our back yard. Once we got the regular size marshmallows it worked great, and the kids were able to get the marshmallows to shoot a decent distance. Would buy a pair again for the same use - silly fun and laughs."
2,Durable and Fun!,"Lots of fun and SUPER durable! Our friendly big blue puppy is about to celebrate his 6th birthday and he doesnt look a day older than 1! My older children loved this dog, my youngest is under the recommended age for this toy but is already enjoying it very much with some assistance. Besides the durability my most favorite thing about this toy is the fact that it doesnt require batteries as there are no electronic parts to it! Ive heard many delightful and imaginative sounds being made while my kids are/were enjoying this fellow."
2,Recipes are great.,"I really liked the idea of a year of recipes, but having tried this out for a week so far, I've found it lacking. Although I loved the idea of a weekly grocery list, this makes skipping recipes impossible, which I have to sometimes because they call for equipment that I don't own (like a BBQ grill) or foods that I can't eat, and the portion sizes vary tremendously. However, all the recipes for the first week I tried were delicious and not too complicated."
1,Total lack of detail,"The book constains too little useful information both for newbie and for experienced administrator. The author is running through the different parts without in-depth explanation or practically useful information. The only reasonable part is Chapter 1 which covers HP-UX installation. I bought this book as preparation tool for HP-UX test but it won't work. Also, about 1/2 of the boot itself consists of hardcopy of man pages. Probably this is the most expensive you to print the man pages. Conclusion - don't waste money on this book, use the books from LDP, HP Instant Information CD or buy ""Unix System Administration Handbook"" by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein - the best overview of UNIX and it's flavours I have ever seen."
2,Original and Outstanding,"Everytime I hear this CD it takes my breath away. The last track ""Ojos Asi"" is a fabulous blend of latin and arabic influence."
1,Adding my results to the din of 1000+ voices already heard on this filter,"Frankly, I'm surprised that this filter has so many positive reviews on Amazon. Maybe you can attach it to your lens and the extra glass will help prevent scratches and dings, but it's not going to improve your photographs.A more expensive filter, in the $50 range, will undoubtedly include better UV filtering that will really help you with spots or haze.If you have an expensive lens with fast glass, don't even *think* about this filter. This filter can easily take your paper thin glass down an entire f/stop. You'll need to look in the $100 filter range for optimal aperture operation with your lens.Bottom line - I would not recommend this filter to anyone!"
2,WONDERFUL,"I'm not really a movie buyer but this is one movie that I had to go out and buy! Fraser and Weisz are a great team. Im in love w/ this movie. You wont be dissapointed with this movie. I watch it everyday! Im a little obsessed with it! Its all I think and talk about. I have the book too, its also good! This movie is amazing. The comedy is great so are the special effects!WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! I can truly say that I loved this movie and I think YOU will too. Its not a waste of money, AT ALL!"
2,Very Good Indeed,"This is a very good soundtrack. The use of piano for Celtic music is not ""celtic band-like"", but the accompanyment by James Galway on whistles and flutes makes it fly!"
1,item not up to standards,"I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS ITEM, INFACT THE CHAIN IS ALREADY BROKEN!!!"
2,Great Product!!!,"My 6yo daughter wanted a fountain for her birthday party. I researched different products and found this one was the best for the money. I used simi-sweet chocolate chips and it worked perfectly. The kids dipped marshmellows, strawberries, bananas, pretzels and animal cookies. The adults found this a hit more then the kids did. The set up and clean up was eazy, the motor is not noisy and the flow of the chocolate worked the way it was supposed to once I got it leveled. I am so glad I bought this product."
1,"I'm not made of money, guys.","I've had it with movie studios releasing movies, which everyone runs out to buy because it's the only version of the film available, and then the studio almost immediately releases the better version that everyone wanted in the first place.You double-dipping c*********s. Knock it off."
1,"Direct quote: ""Pure rubbish.""","Three Oingo Boingo band members have already commented elsewhere that this book contains more opinions and assumptions than actual fact, but it doesn't take that fact to notice it. Keith Breese skates through his mis-information and lack of simple research; filling in the blanks with his own imagination. He can't even keep low-level information, something as simple as dates, correct. Three quarters of the book is merely quoting other people's work, i.e. reviews and interviews. As one O.B. member said in an online review that is easily found, ""pure rubbish."" I think that says it all. It is no wonder why respectable publishers would print this; he had to print it himself through Xybris books (a pay-to-be-pulished outfit). The book itself is full of misspellings, bad typeography, misuse of quotations and punctuation, and is devoid of any form of proper grammar. Yes, you can say this isn't the pulp it was printed on, especially at this going price."
2,Broccoli Power - ENERGIZE!,"A blistering indictment of all that is evil, phoney, and cruel in the world. But just because this comic's heart is in the right place and it's targets are well-chosen doesn't mean it's any good.I could go on and on about the plot's coherence, the high-quality artwork, and Mickey's moral complexity; but what really makes this comic good are the little touches. Here are a few of my favorites:1. Hali Bossi's Turkish ""pants of many patterns"",2. The exterminator's tiny wiener,3. ""I am purified! Now I am ready to kill! Kill! Kill in Jesus name!""4. A Central American palindrome5. Fatima (that chick is hot!)6. The coolest cereal box cover ever!7. Zombie rehabilitation8. The proud look on the duck's face after he bites the rabbit's ass9. The Hateful Bread10. Winger, Asia, Poison!This comic is superb."
1,Bad product - worse customer support,"I purchased this drive for its security features and it was a big mistake. Software did not work so I contacted Iomega support. After 20 minutes of 'try this', 'try that' and 'try another computer' the end result was the same as the issue. Imoega promised to replace the drive if I return the defective drive. It has been over a month since Iomega received my damaged drive (sent via registered mail) and I still do not have my replacement. I keep getting the run around. Do not purchase this product unless you are a masochist that loves when a company runs all over you with lies. Whatever happend to the Iomega I once liked?"
2,Just what I need!!!,"After researching for months I found this great machine. It is easy to use and a awesome price. Why bother with features you will never use, I already own a great digital camera (Canon Powershot S100)and basically wanted a camcorder for video. If your looking for a great looking cam at a good price search no more Samsung is the way to go. Great job Samsung!!!!!"
2,So much for the money!,"I loved this DVD, and wish Reader's Digest would make many more like it. The photography and narration are excellent, and the DVD highlights so many different and fascinating locations. It has three very long segments, so you get your money's worth. (I keep it on the TV in my kitchen and watch it over and over as I cook, and I catch my kids watching it as well.)"
2,Original series,"Take Jurassic Park and turn it into a program about the development and life of the Dinosaur and you'll get an idea of the quality of this program. If you like the subject matter, then this is a must to watch, graphically superb with the history of the dinosaur to boot. The BBC at its best."
2,Billfromthenexis,I enjoyed the read. I would recommend the Micheal Whitman books as a nice complement to this book.
2,One of the best New England Cookbooks,"I have had this book for several years. After travelling around New England, I found many of the true recipes for meals I have had right here in this book. It also has a lot of Portuguese recipes familiar to Cape Codders. From chowders to wonderful seafood recipes for haddock, cod, lobster and clams it moves to blueberry recipes, cornbread, jams, cakes, punches...the famous knock-your-socks-off Fish House Punch. Ever been to Galilee in Rhode Island? Find the recipe for their clam fritters here. Beach Plum jam, oysters, mussels, pea soup, roast venison, gingerbread, candies, fig pudding...all real ""people"" food. This small book packs a lot of punch."
2,Informational,"This book really has practical information to get started your attic reno. It is not a pictorial design idea book. Its a good, ""cut to the chase"" sort of book."
1,GREATEST HITS COLLECTION BY THE EAGLES IS WAY BETTER!,Take my advice I recommend Eagles Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 volumes one and two is the definitive collection for the hardcore music fan out there. Because I have all these classic songs on my CD albums!
1,Not the very best.,"Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo SpeakersIt was easy to install, and the sound is good. I have a problem with a popping sound. Even when the stereo is off. One or both of the speakers will pop on and off, for no apparent reason."
2,THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO!,"THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO! Be prepared to read the whole book once you start because you won't want to put it down until you finish it!I met Michelle Whitedove when she was doing research for this book at The Lodge in Cloudcroft, New Mexico where I work. I found her to be a very exciting and intriguing person.Ms Whitedove has the uncanny ability to include you in the saga as you travel with her, so that you experience what she experiences as she travels from California to Louisiana visiting famed ""haunted places"" in Ghost Stalker. In many places you can feel the hair on your neck stand up as you participate in the adventure!I am very honored that Ms Whitedove saw fit to include my non-fiction short story, ""The Unruly Guest on Friday the Thirteenth"" in Ghost Stalker."
1,Weak power supply,"Antec has dropped the ball on this one. My power supply came in DOA.If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.The case weighs 25 pounds. It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles."
2,Whats with the price HIKE!,Its sad to see the price HIKE on Superpump 250. Superpump Max is a little cheaper but I dont like it. I tried the same flavor ( Blue Ras) and did not taste the same as the 250 and did dot anything for me.It also looked almost pinkish instead of blue. The flavors are not even close in taste...Booo! for raising the price I will no longer be using it also unless the price goes down to what it was before.
1,Just got mine an hour ago from Amazon,"Started off with a positive attitude until I got to the screwdrivers. After breaking my thumbnail in a couple places I finally gave up and got a small screwdriver in order to pry up any of the 3 blades. I've worked them back and forth and still the same. The smallest is the worst, no way to flip it up with a fingernail. The Phillips head on the other end is just fine. Guess I'll Email Leatherman tomorrow, if possible, and see what they say. I bought this under my wife's account, so if the review is under her name, let it be known we are talking a man's somewhat bigger, tougher thumbnail, not hers."
1,Ginseng,"This product did not seem to work for me. In comparing it with other Siberian Ginseng, the one without alcohol worked better. This is about 50% Alcohol."
2,One Hell of an album,"Buy it! Simple as that. This album is very dynamic... melodic, rockin and punishing."
2,Genuine Man and his Fascinating journey thru Jewelry design,"I read the book and enjoyed all the photos from cover to cover!Robert Lee Morris is such a great natural designer, very genuine as human being.I found many similarities with his life and mine as a jewelry designer.I discovered that my first pieces were much like his style, when I didn't knew who he was and never saw his work before.Totally inspiring. You can be tempted to tear and frame the photos of the book as art pictures!Benjamin P.Puerto Rico"
1,Didn't do what I wanted,"I bought it to get rid of tall, thin, wheat-like weeds, but the instructions say it works for weeds with foliage. I sprayed it on them anyway just in case, and now I have a bunch of brown circles in my yard (most of my yard is crabgrass) with the weeds I wanted killed still standing tall. I sprayed it on some other weeds with lots of foliage, and all it did was wilt them a little."
2,Why is this book out of print?,"This is one of the best publications on the Aztecs, a major historical source that is accessible and fascinating. University of California Press made a mistake by including color illustrations and giving this a high price. It was always pricey for assignment for college classes, and now its out of print. It would have been better to give up the color illustrations and lower the price. But in any case this book it is worth looking at for anyone interested in the Aztecs, Mesoamerica, or native American cultures."
2,This book is to long for college classes,"This book provides a great deal of indepth information. It was required reading in Chinese History Studies At Oklahoma State University Under Dr. Park, who completely tried to destroy every reasonable rational the book provided and used certian passages to distort history to fit his idea of it. So buy the book, stay out of Any classes taught by Dr. Park and learn on your own."
2,good produce,a good sturdy nylon belt to do weighted dips and pull-ups...waist lengths are adjustable using the chain latch. good bargain price.
1,Not Loud Enough,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. Definitly NOT loud enough, I tried them with my Ipod and my Garmin - neither was loud enough. I had to go with in ear phones."
2,Need to learn german language.,"I think that this is the most important work into XX century philosophy. But if you really want to understand ""Sein und Zeit"" is very important that you read the book in Heidegger's maternal language: german."
1,Good season but bad quality of the DVD,"I am a fan of Criminal Minds and I own all the seasons.However, I am surprise to find that the quality of this Season DVD is really bad...almost like a VHR or VCD quality... =("
1,worked great until it broke,"Worked great until it broke. Had it for about 3 months, always handled it very carefully, but then it just stopped working right... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird, and ultimately unusable. :("
2,BUY THIS,"The first ep on the tape deserves a 5 star in itself! It's very emotional and sad. However, it loses a star because I HATE the english singing voice for Priss. IT REALLY BAD!"
2,All your favorites,"Classic CD. This cd has all of your favorite Van Halen songs, you will not be disappointed. Good classic rock and roll. Solid."
1,Aburrido y pedagógico,"Este libro intenta narrar la supuesta historia de un chino que viene a Occidente, pero este ""choque"" entre dos culturas (en vez de tener la fluidez de otras novelas sobre el Lejano Oriente como ""Memorias de una geisha"" o ""La esposa del dios del fuego""), se convierte aqui en una historia aburridisima y torpemente contada. Es evidente que la autora buscó información en diversas fuentes, pero no tiene el vuelo literario para convertir esos datos en una historia interesante. Es el tipo de autor que pretende hacer una novela ""historica"", copiando lo que dicen libros de textos, pero nunca logra integrar la información de las fuentes con la ficcion. Peor que esa información impostada es la trama aburrida y sin vuelo alguno. Tuve que hacer un esfuerzo enorme para llegar al final. Mi esposa dejó el libro en la página 23. Consejo: No pierda su tiempo. Busquese otro libro."
2,Riveting History,"The Company is one of the most riveting modern historical novels, especially for people who have lived at the time of events from the early 1950s to the 1990s, which are covered in its span.The depiction of many real-life characters in American Government and in the CIA are quite chilling in Littell`s description of the madness and incompetence that has pervaded much of the CIA`s history, none more so than the hapless James Jesus Angleton, who for years told Kim Philby everything the CIA was doing and yet still managed to hold his post as CIA Cheif of Counter-Intelligence for decades after Philby`s unmasking."
1,Worthless,"It's funny that I see two reviews that say the book is lousy, and several others that sound like a commercial. So, what's the truth? The truth is this book is little more than a pamphlet hyping the used car biz. It offers very little in terms of specifics. Those reviews praising the book as some sort of godsend were put there by the author. This book is filled with vague and very obvious information. I have found all the information in this book and more on the internet for free. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Ani's Worst Album,"She's been on a downslide for the last couple of years, but to judge by this cd its getting worse. She tries to ryhme words with themselves, she continues on the completely mined-out vein of politically complaining that has replaced all her other subject matter lately, she's forgotten any way to show emphasis or go for emotional impact other than just repeating the first verse as the last verse, apparently...I can't find a good thing to say about this one, which is a real shame because Ani is one of the only artists out there today who could fairly and without exaggeration be called both a poet and a geniusShe needs to take some time off and get some new material and new inspiration though, and until she does I'm afraid all her cds will be as bad as, or worse than, this one. I would give it zero stars if i could"
2,Not great but worth,"I ordered this to get a special discount by meeting the minimum order. However, this was useful but not a great product to resolve my flosser needs."
1,DON'T LIKE,"I usually do my research before buying new products. But, didn't do as much when looking for a sippy cup. I thought this one would be better when compared to the others. I did speak with one parent and she told me it was okay, but showed me a defect with another well known brand. Well, I'm not pleased. The spout leaks and collapeses and is a bit too large for my son's mouth. I've tried loosening it a bit, but that doesn't help. I only use it when absolutely necessary. Will definitely not recommend this one..."
2,GREAT REMIXES OF OLDER TUNES!,"I AM REALLY ENJOYING THIS CD. I BASICALLY HAVE THESE TUNES ON WHEN I AM IN MY WORKOUT ROOM, RUNNING ON THE TREADMILL, ETC.LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AND DREAM WEAVER ARE MY TWO FAVORITE CUTS ON THE ALBUM, THEN VENTURA HIGHWAY IS A GREAT CUT TOO...BUT IT IS AN ALL AROUND GOOD CD!!! I HOPE WARNER COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER ONE SOON!"
2,nice,nice little radar for the money. does what it says it does. kind of loud and sends alerts right away.
1,Insert Batman to sell comic books,"Wow what can I say about this graphic novel... I honestly didn't like this book, but just because I didn't like this book doesn't mean I can give it a 1 star. It was a book, it had color and technically it was completed. After reading this book I felt like the author's just wanted to shock me. It didn't feel like a true batman story, and the ending was a joke. I don't want to give anything away, but the way they made Harvey look in this book was horrible. Took his coin away and moved him Tarot cards, give me a break.On the extra content, it's nice to have, but it's completely unneccesary. Infact after reading through it I was certian that the author was just trying for the shock and aww effect."
2,front end service kit,Bought this for my son as a gift. Primarily for heavy trucks. Works great and makes the job of replacing front end components a lot easier.
2,Awesome read - Amazing CD!!!!!,I was amazed by the power of this technology! Within minutes I knew something profound was happening to me...it felt like I was going to levitate at any minute. Very powerful stuff.
2,The Family That Preys,This was Tyler Perry's best movie. Kathy Bates and Alfrey Woodard were great !!
2,System not too bad,"Not a bad product. It works better than standard litter boxes. True, the unit and the cartridges are somewhat pricey, but it does the job. I have three cats and have had some trouble with one of the cats not wanting to use it at all. Also, I did have my entire unit fail but the company was prompt in replacing it via snail mail after I call the 1-800 number. Be careful cleaning the unit and don't get water inside the electronic components because its NOT sealed. The cartridges are very convenient"
2,AMAZING!!!!!!,"I could not believe this was The Queen. I am a retired singer and always loved Queen Latifah's music, even rap:), and as a gifted actress. I was amazed at the versatility and sultry sounds that came from her wonderful voice. My nieces are teenagers and when I let them here this CD (I didn't tell them it was the Queen), they said that it was good, who is it? I told them Queen Latifah and they did not believe me until they sat there and listened to the entire CD and realized it was her. They have a new appreciation for jazz and blues and see it in a different light. Hail to the Queen!! Music has an amazing affect on teens. My nieces listen to this CD constantly. WOW!!!"
1,Vomit Inducing!!,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!! I can't think of any other words to describe this disgrace of an album! From start to finish, this is truly horrendous! If you think it's a good album, you truly need to consult a psychiatrist and get a hearing check! Avoid this any way you can, it's AWFUL! The worst album I've ever listened to in my entire life, bar none!!!"
2,Missing accessories,"The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!"
2,Excellent resource for how to take the test,"If you are looking for a last minute study session, this is not the place to turn. They give you excellent advice on how the test is scored and methods of marking answers but there are few passages in it. They do provide an excellent list of authors you should know and quick overviews of some classic literature but nothing extreamely specific. I used this book in conjunction with my own study program and found the book really worth my while. It's a little light on Lit theory though, so you may want to brush up on that part of the test. Overall I would buy it again. It's written with a dry sense of humor and a drive to see the student do well"
2,Part Of 3 Rarities Comps,"Derek Lawrence produced alot of bands and sessions in the 60s, this collection featuring many gems some of which are unreleased. Included are rarities from Richie Blackmore solo and with his bands Green Bullfrog and The Outlaws, Jethro Toe (Tull), Albert Lee, Hot Chocolate, and others. 20 tracks in all from 1965 to 1970."
2,Interesting but not her best work,"I have read ALL of Alice Hoffman's books and was very excited when this one came out. I have to admit though, I am a little disappointed. I am about half-way through the book and finding it not a compelling read (I keep hoping I'll get hooked)HOWEVER, I would urge any reader - whether you are loving this book, or hating it - read her other work, ESPECIALLY ""TURTLE MOON"". That was my introduction to Hoffman and really blew me away. Don't give up on Alice, every book can't ""hit a home run""."
1,a book obsessed with technologies,"The very idea that all the technologies serve the purpose of businesses gets lost here in this book.If one wants to look for help for their work, look somewhere else.If one wants to learn some jargons to impress his/her date, this one is the ideal one."
1,Horrible,"The product came packaged nicely, I went out to the car popped the cassette in and plugged the aux jack to my phone. The sound coming through my stereo was complete garbage. It sounded muddy and staticky. Don't buy this product it's a complete waste of money."
2,Something to think about.,"The world-building in this book was superb. Set on the home planet of the only other sentient species ever found, the characters in this book are anthropologists who are trying to understand this new kind of intelligent life. In the process, they discover more about themselves than the objects of their studies. Listed as a Utopian novel in many reviews, it is not. However, it does include a distinct future Earth (in the human anthropologist's memories, actions, and attitudes) that could be described as a Utopia of sorts. This is a book for those of us who like to think, and it's one of the best books of this kind I have ever read. Do try it."
1,IOGear USB Hard Drive,Problem with this drive. It does not work with a standard USB cable included. Must have a Y cable that was sent to me after several calls to IOGear's tech support. It took a return and 30 days to get this product to work. After that it is working fine! Good luck!John...
2,"The biblical story of Moses, with illustrations & commentary","This 50-minute program from A&E;'s ""Biography"" series tells the biblical story of Moses, illustrating the story with footage from relevant locations in the Middle East and with artists' depictions of biblical characters and episodes. Jewish and Christian biblical scholars and others add background information, explanation, and interpretation.One commentator seemed overly confident that he knew what was going on in Moses' psyche, but other than that, I found the commentary interesting and helpful, and it didn't overwhelm the simple telling of the story.This video does a good job of bringing the story of Moses to life. I have used excerpts from it in teaching Judaism and Christianity to undergraduates and high school students, and I think it would also be an excellent resource for Bible study groups.(Also recommended: Orson Scott Card's ""Stone Tables,"" a novelization of the life of Moses.)"
2,Clever Script and Stellar Acting,"I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to fast-forward through the video, but found myself kicking back and thoroughly enjoying ""Get the Gringo."" It's not easy (and actually risky) to attempt mixing comedy, action, and drama in a film, yet the writers (including Gibson), actors, and director pulled it off here. I agree with others that Mel is at the top of his game in this one, and his co-stars, Kevin Hernandez (as the boy) and Dolores Heredia (as the mom) shine as well. My favorite scene involves Mel...nah, I'm not going to spoil it. :)"
1,A limp and hurried retelling,"Read the book. The movie is terrible and only hints at the depth and beauty of the story CS Lewis wrote. I am sorely disappointed. I imagine it would be a hard story to bring to the screen, but good lord, if they can put ""Life of Pi"" on the big screen, they could do this one. The movie only vaguely recalls the plot of the book, which is so much fun to read, and the movie jumps quickly and shallowly from point to stupid point. It makes me worry that an entire generation will miss out on the book, because they won't be inspired to read it by this lazy hack job."
1,"Hoffman, what happened?","I loved ""Practical Magic"" and ""Turtle Moon"", but this book was such a disappointment. Nothing about how March reacted to Hollis made any sense, beyond her girlhood dreams about what might-have-been. If he'd been waiting for her all his life, he had a funny way of showing it. And nothing that we knew about March would prepare us for how downright silly she is. The man is an abusive creep!Some of the writing was her usual wonderful(The entire first chapter, for example), but I never got over the Kathy/Heathcliff/Wuthering Heights story. There was something ridiculous about them, too. Way too much melodrama, not enough insight."
1,DON'T BUY this CD,"I spend hours, like 12-15 at a time in airplanes. I love my Ipod. I love David Grey. I can't transfer songs to my Ipod from this disc. SONY needs to get a message. I will buy the bootleg version when I get to Asia in a couple of weeks for $1.50 . I never do this because I believe that stealing income from artists is so wrong. A special thanks to Amazon for the warning.MJD"
2,A Thinker,"Excellent, well casted movie. Probably best viewed with someone else so that you can discuss your findings. A movie that needs to be watched more than once inorder to formulate your final conclusion. A real thinker!"
2,Touching,"This is a very touching movie. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is an awesome actor and this movie shows his talent. I won't go into the details so I won't spoil the movie. However, there are many life lessons in this film. Enjoy."
2,Nova Developments Print Explosion,"Simply the best software for creating personal projects. Contains hundreds of ready made templates for just about anything you would need or want from cards to banners, signs to crafts, labels to envelopes . It is easy to navigate with the graphic interface. Thousands of clipart images and photos are include for just about any occaision and all are 100% scalable"
1,Rod too soft,"the rod is too soft and thin. I need this to support cable wire and hang the shower curtain at a L-shaped, but the rod is too soft and actually gets bend in by the tension."
1,Worthless,"This router NEVER works and is always slow. I've had it for several months, and I am constantly starting and restarting it. A complete waste of money."
2,"Classic Cornell discs - American Bird Songs, Vols 1&2 on CD","This is a CD transcription of the first two record sets of bird songs ever recorded and released in this country. Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology created two six-78 rpm album sets (a total of 24 sides) back in the late forties- American Bird Songs, Volume One and American Bird Songs, Volume Two. They translated themselves to lps in the late 1950s, then went out of print, never to appear on cassette and not on cd until now.Each band of about 3.5 minutes each contains a set of three or four birds, identified by Dr. Arthur A. Allen, grand old man of Ornithology at Cornell. I grew up on these and they are a great introduction to bird song for young people. I'm glad they're back.I wish Cornell's other lps (African Bird Songs, Mexican Bird Songs and Songs of Insects)would emerge. In addition to 12 inch lps, they produced a series of 10 inch lps and 78 singles which have also disappeared."
1,Earbuds failure,"The product arrived in a timely fashion. The sound was good for the price point, BUT, one ear bud has failed within a 4 month time frame. You get what you pay for."
1,Saucony Grid Triumph 3,"I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight. Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line, size twelve and a half. They aren't the same and although the fit is good, they're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead: pricier but considerably better.For God's sake: don't buy runing shoes on-line!"
1,Vague,"I was expecting more information than this book offered. It did contain some basic generic information, but bottom line was go and find out how to take advantage of foreclosures in your area by yourself. The entire book took an hour to read."
2,What I wanted,I bought a couple for my boys and they were easy to install and have worked beautifully. I'd buy them for myself if I didn't already have others.
2,beats the sh*t outta ANTS,"great dvd... animation is all too realistic, extremely funny and entertaining... definitely worth it"
2,Catchy and worth owning,"I've had the CD for about a year, and her vocals are amazing. Check out the hidden acoustic version of ""Burn"", it'll sing to your soul. That track is worth purchasing the entire thing alone."
1,Didn't work for me....,"So I set this up. I even read the instructions. The instructions say to place it at the entrance of your yard rather than near your garden. Well my yard is wide open, no fence, hence the problem with deer in the first place. So I can't do that. maybe that's why it isn't doing it's job for me. The shocker definately works, I tried it. the logic that a deer will smell the scent, shock themselves, then be detered makes sense unless you have 4-5 deer that travel together. The unit takes 15 minutes to charge in between shocks. IF one gets shocked, there are still other deer that can keep eating my vegetables. I don't even know if I'm shocking one of them. I just know that this isn't working the way that I hoped. I gave it two stars because mechanically it works, I just don't think the product concept it as sound as it is made out to be. I will get one of those motion detecting hose sprayers that amazon sells, that is pretty fool proof. Next year will be a better season..hopefully."
1,"Cool idea, terrible controllers.","I loved the idea of the glowing controllers. They look cool when lit up and work pretty nicely. Except for the fact that the joysticks break off of the metal part after about 3 months. It seems to be just a cheap plastic housing that connects the joystick to the actual metal piece that moves. I received them as a gift for christmas with my xbox. I loved them. The white one broke after about 3 months, and I thought I had just gotten a bad pair of them. I bought another package and they worked great. Until they both broke. Cool idea, complete waste of money. Too flimsy and the joysticks are barely held onto the controller."
2,More and Funnier Stuff Yet.,This is Lewis Black at his outragous best. I didn't think he could do better than his last album. I WAS WRONG!!
2,Good Music..........simply beautiful,"I have only heard about 15 seconds of each song from the sample but is already crazy about this album.Can you believe that!?!?!Believe me,I know a good song when a hear one.This is defintely going into my collection."
2,Celebrity Cameo,"Could not care less about Sara Evans' music, but my best friend is the ""Looker, smooth talkin' son of a gun"" from Suds in the Bucket. This alone warrants a 5star review."
2,thoughtful and entertaining,"Although some people who reviewed this book felt it was sub-standard for Haldeman it fit my criteria of a good book. First, it was a good read. Second the plot had substance. Third, it made me think about the central issues within the novel. I'm happy when two of the three standards are met. As for the politically correct business I don't think so. Haldeman has never been that kind of writer, he has often brought about the ambiguity in relationships and of possible futures. Characters don't have to be likeable to be interesting or engaging. The issues of the cost of peace may be handled better in other books but Haldeman's take seems honest which makes this a book I'd suggest to others."
2,"Hey, What A Concept!","Rachael Ray delivers yet again! Before she was a Food Network favorite, this hard working former server and PR genius wrote up a number of recipes for genuinely appealing meals that could be prepared in a half-hour or less. She used to go to supermarkets and do demonstrations and sell her books that way. She's earned her current status as one of America's favorite cooking personalities and this book shows why. Unlike so many cookbooks, everything in here is kitchen-tested, it works, and it's absolutely worth the time it takes to make. Rachael Ray has kept food preparation simple and she really goes the extra mile in passing on her time saving tips on how to prepare fine meals in today's hurried world. This is a fabulous book and I recommend it without qualification!"
2,Must Have!,"I'm a mom with T1 diabetes and this book covers just about all of the concerns when one is a parent with diabetes. The great thing about the book is that its filled with tips and advice from other parents with diabetes.The book is a nice easy read too. Not too medical and Kathryn Gregorio Palmer's ""voice"" is like that of an old friend."
1,Don't waste your money,"Thankfully I checked this book out of the library. Since I hadn't been impressed by ""Noble Intentions"", I didn't want to take a chance buying this one. I can read about anything, but this was such drivel I just skimmed over the book. From what I read, the writing was poor, the characters annoying, and the ""love scenes"" insipid. I won't waste my time with another book by this author."
1,Incredibly bad product and service,"The kit was supposed to be complete except for batteries. It arrived without: memory card (so would not function even if it worked), serial cable, wrist strap, camera case, quickstart guide, users guide. The camera will not even power up on batteries (does using an AC adapter). SO NO VALUE at all. Obviously this kit had ZERO inspection. NO REPLY TO EMAILS. this is the worst experience that I have had buying from an online vendor."
2,worth it,"I've used several of these now, on several different bikes. They seem to do a pretty good job of keeping stickers out of my mountain bike tires... though a goathead recently went thru one of them. Only negative I'd give is that they don't cover any of the sidewalls, so if you get a puncture on the side, they're worthless. I've now gone to slime tubes, and so far, so good."
1,Las Canciones Son Malas,"I'm not sure what's worse: The CD sound quality or the songs themselves. I'll give it to the songs - at least you'll remember the wretched CD sound quality; the songs are formulaic and forgettable. Whatever spark of creativity the Outlaws rediscovered on their previous release (Ghost Riders) had abandoned them for this effort.One wonders how ""Running"" and ""Easy Does It"" (the only tracks here that are even vaguely interesting) might have sounded in the hands of the original band."
2,An Excellent Read,"This is a very entertaining book. It may start out a bit slow but picks up quickly. I ususally read to put myself to sleep, but this one kept me up past my bedtime!"
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!,"It is an understatement that this novel was just plain ridiculous! After reading the section about ""what really happened to Hoffa"", I felt like I swallowed a golf shoe. The character suffers the tired old adage...a hit man with a tortured soul. The love scence between the main character and the single mother on the run is straight out of Penthouse Forum. I need to gargle. There is still a bad taste in my mouth! Hint: A little less Dungeons and Dragons and a little more research into the field."
1,What a disappointment!!,I bought this vacuum to replace one just like it that I had owned for two years. I returned the first replacement because it was impossible to use on rugs; the brush was too long and hung in the rug. The second replacement was the same so I returned it also. It looks like the quality control in these vacuums has disappeared. I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemy.
1,Not the same,"I love Thymes Filigree and when it disappeared from the stores I was lost. Then I decided to try on line. This is not the same fragrance. It has hints of the original but is ""thinner"" and something is missing. I will not order this way again."
2,Wow Nick,"I bought this CD just because I'm a pop music fan and I figured it would be an ""ok"" buy. But whoa! This is a whole lot better than I anticipated. Truthfully, though, I have not heard every song on the album because Just listening through on the first listen, a few songs really popped out that I continuously play over and over again. ""Help Me"", ""My Confession"", ""Miss America"", ""Heart Without A Home"", and ""I Just Wanna Take You Home"" will have you hooked for months (or at least until Timberlake's album comes out)! Especially Miss America. There's hints of rock on the songs Nick cowrote and the songs by others are more pop-ish. So there's lots of influence on this album. Overall, a Top 10 of 2002, at least until the pop scene erupts which started last week with Nick and Christina and will be going on for a few weeks now."
2,Alternative Learning,"As a homeschooling mom, I found this book very informative and well-designed. My children (1 high school-aged taking college classes and the other elemntary school-aged) both enjoy the book and find it interesting. If you're looking for something for creative minds who have to have a reason to study a picture for a while to more fully understand concepts, this is the way to go. You can color the pictures or not and still get some useful material from this book."
1,Babylon5-The Lost Tales,I absolutely loved the series but this new 'movie' stinks so bad I think I want a refund. Boring! ANYONE who says they liked it must work for theproduction company.
1,WHY ???,"I never bought this item so why is it appearing on this list, please let me know the answer ok??"
2,Can't Get enough!,"I can't get enough of this series...please, please make more! Very classy, accurate for the era, like eating a wonderful dessert."
2,Classic Compilation,"Baby Bash's classic compilation, Before He Got to be Huge (Suga,Suga). A Must for Baby Bash Fans"
1,Keeps going downhill,"I have read every book in the series, and despite the fact I was not thrilled with the 4th book, I was excited to see the 5th one had come out. Unfortunately, as far as the series go, I feel the first one was wonderful, the second ok, the third excellent, and the fourth and fifth nothing to write home about. Auel needs to get herself a good editor to tighten up her work. There is a good novel in here somewhere, she just needs some help to find it. She also needs to remember that what made the first book so special is that Ayla was human. She's become such a superwoman I sometimes just find myself shaking my head.I'll read the 6th one when it comes out, it is as if I can't help myself. But here's to hoping Auel recovers the magic she seems to have lost."
1,flaky products,"A retractable usb cable seemed like a great idea and for the first few weeks I loved it but very quickly items I plugged in were no longer recognized by the computer. I thought it was the computer for a while. One day while switching usb jacks in frustration I noticed that if I held the cable at a certain angle it worked. Quickly, the necessary angle got narrower and narrower until a week or so later, the cable no longer worked at all. The materials these cables are built with are not up to the stress of repetitive extend/re-track movements."
2,I like this book.,"This is an easy book to read.Mr Rankin has written this book from his unique perspective of Theater, Philosophy, and Sales. He is, of course, also a very successful businessman. He has provided us an insight into the interrelationships of these disciplines, and the tools to use them.The reader doesn't need to be an experienced sales professional to enjoy and benefit from this book. Although the book is easy to read, it is also full of good ideas that experienced businesspeople can learn.Don't be scared off by my review. The book is well written, and besides providing us with tools to live with - it is a good story."
1,Mediocre,"I thought this would be a great deal for the price, but cover was incredibly wrinkled upon washing and had no duvet ties to secure it. I've had it for a year, and buttons have popped off, etc. Seems cheaply made. However, I used it for one year in a dorm and it served its purpose. Just don't expect to use it for an extended period of time."
2,God's desire for a Love filled Marriage,Wow! We are so excited to have this in our home and in our hearts! The Lord is using Ken Nair to change lives forever!
2,Awesome!,"This sheet is an great deal! Its very soft, washes up well and very well priced. I very much recommend it."
1,Tiny quantity Cheapie applicator,"The review title pretty much says it all. The quantity was not sufficient to fully lube my admittedly very dry belt and platform. I think it is probably .5 oz and not the .05 oz listed in the product specs, but even so there are much better values out there."
2,This is the one that started it all.,"This is the first one in a series that really started the entire fantasy craze. The Hobbit and the subsequent Lord of the Ring Series really launched an entire generation of Fantasy readers. I loved this book as well as the books that followed. While this is more light hearted than the ones that follow, it certainly is just as great as the others."
1,Rough cooking surface,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008GKDJ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI've used this skillet everyday since receiving it hoping the cooking surface would improve. The rough cooking surface is still casting off iron colored 'muck' when I wash it. I know how to Season a cast iron skillet so this isn't the problem. I'm very unhappy with the pebble like cooking surface.
1,Lasted less than 1 minute before it died...,"i wired it up, it worked, so i was going to wire up the light next, nothing worked, then i just did the unit itself again w/o the light, nothing worked...dead in a couple minutes...not the best product in the world..."
1,Lots of fluff,"Not easy to understand. Sometimes it is difficult to follow what the author means. There is too much detail, which I feel was getting in the way of understanding CGI.I was initlally exicited , but after reading the first few chapters, i think i will have to look elsewhere."
2,Exceptional!,"Since I heard the song in Highlander III movie, I decided to download MP3 files from audiogalaxy.After I downloaded those files, I had no doubt that I need to have this album. I went to Amazon and ordered this CD (with also a book of Douglas Adams).I don't think that this music is like Enya. This is totally different quality and flavor."
2,A wonderful learning tool,"I have had the Kindle 2 for about 2 weeks and I have really enjoyed it. I have been reading a lot more than I have in the past, more rapidly and 2 or 3 books at a time.I have used the Read to Me feature which I have also enjoyed. The voice needs a little work because it will state quotes and it is a little mechanical, BUT it is amazing. I like the fact that you can choose a male or female voice.I have enjoyed the Kindle and I say this is a great option for people who like to read but have run out of shelf space. If I wanted a new book. I had to sell others from my collection to make room for the new editions. I also like the fact that not all of the books are $9.99. Once you purchase the Kindle and get over the sticker shock then it is nice to get a book for $0.99.Overall a wonderful product and I hope to own this one for years to come!"
1,So so very sad,"I watched the remake series of Land of the Lost when I was a kid and loved the series, and later I watched the original as reruns on tv land. They were both great, adventurous, entertaining shows. This movie is horrible. It simply makes fun of the stories that were these great shows. I knew the moment I saw the advertisments for this movie that it was going to be bad. Especially when it was announced that it would star Will Farrel. At that point I knew that this movie was going to be nothing more than stupid jokes aimed at making fun of the original shows.So glad I avoided going to see this in the theater."
2,Wow,Just returned from El Salvador. This really gave me perspective. Acting was superb and the story line was similar to one I heard while there. Afraid it was all too common
2,A quiet revolution!,"""Recovery from Childhood in America"" is radical in the true sense of the word: It goes to the root of the being human problems of anxiety, self loathing, hate, and violence. And not just in a theoretical discourse, but by proposing simple clear steps and exercises one can take to eliminate the source of unhappiness from one's life. Doesn't pychotherapy of all kinds propose that? Yes, but it can't deliver because it's message is incomplete and really only half formed. As one who has tried many types of therapy in my search for happiness, and found them leaving me with a ""now what"" feeling, I find relief in her method; an answer that works simply and beautifully. I am grateful she wrote this book, that I discovered it, and that it works for me. If you get this book and do what is suggested you will have all the psychic and spiritual tools you will ever need."
2,Still using these forms 7 years later!,These forms are extremely extremely useful to a photographer starting out. I've used them for about three different companies and recommend this book to all my assistants... Bravo!
1,"Good Ideas, Bad Choices","The story starts well, and drags you in, you can't help but start to like the characters. Among other reasons, thats why I had such a hard time with this story. I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief. There are several parts of this book where as I was reading I simply had to say, huh?The overall romance and story is enjoyable enough. I simply wish the author could have changed a few minor plots, and perhaps removed or altered a few scenes to make the story more believable."
1,travel help,"this was my second version of Streets & Trips - loved the first one! not happy with this version at all. wouldn't allow me to update it, no contact for technical issues, and then, when I tried to load it on a new computer with Windows 7, it wouldn't work at all. Microsoft's lovely website for compatibility issues says it does work with 7, but it sure doesn't with mine."
2,"""The Dr. Is In""","I don't know why some say this was not as good as Hellraiser. I seen Hellraiser and the hooks where pretty much the sickest thing in the movie. This one on the other hand goes over the deep end. Not to many movies dare to show a viewer what a trip in hell might look like. I remember way back in the day seeing this for the first time and it was one of the only horror movies I could remember keeping me on the edge of my seat. No I wasn't scarred, just so into it I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Definitely own this movie!!"
2,Best toy for the price,"I've had my Gigabeat for 2 weeks so far. It's heavier than the Ipod, but that makes it feel more solid to me. I'm not a big fan of the controls, but I may need to get used to them. The program isn't as awful as everyone makes it out to be. I wish Media 10 worked with 2.0 uSB, but that is no fault of Toshiba. The nice feature on the program is MusicID, if you have any songs in your library with any missing info, the program finds it and fills it in. There is also a great feature for downloading CD's directly to the player with the press of one button. Put the CD into your computer, press a button on your player's cradle, and in about 2 minutes the CD is on your player. Very Nice, great bang for your buck.By the way, order the Belkin Portable Music TuneCast II FM Transmitter. I play my Gigabeat through my truck's radio and cleaned out the clutter of all my CD's in my truck."
1,Poor Condition,"The recipes are good. I ordered this one for my daughter so she doesn't need to keep borrowing mine, but it is in awful condition, so bad it should not have been sold to anyone."
2,Not for the average joe,"I think in order to understand this movie, you have to have some semblance of intelligence. It's not for your ""average joe"", blue collar, working class kind of person. But if you have what it takes to watch and get this movie, it is one awesome movie. I love movies that make you feel, make you think, and this is definitely one of those movies. Like someone else mentioned, it's not about addiction per sea. It's about hope and dreams and how easily they are lost. It's about life and how it can sneak up on you and destroy all that you thought you were. It's about how easy we can get lost and how those around us don't even see it happening until it's too late. If you want a mindless, dumb movie, don't watch this. However, if you want a movie that will make you think, make you feel; a movie that will stay with you even after you are done watching it - then this is the movie for you."
2,TRACK LISTING,TRACKS:1. Di Bolina2. Nel Bene E Nel Male3. Cio' Che Ci Resta4. Sul Confine5. Cose Che Dimentico6. Tracce7. Notti Di Genova8. L'era Dell'oro9. La Notte Di San Loren
1,Not totally useless,"I bought this to use in my car. It was not powerful enough to do a more than a modest job. I wish that I had not bought it, and just paid for a powerful vacuum at the car wash. The Dirt Devil will do OK if you are just picking up dust bunnies, cat hair, or light objects. I gave it 2 stars instead of three because I consider it's label, ""Extreme Power"" to be false advertising."
2,Thank You,"This book should be required reading in every high school across the country.This book uses FACTS to offset the empty rhetoric spewed forth from the political figures of the left.Please America, try reading something like this before watching another docu-drama passed off as a documentary.Why only 4 stars? Because it was too short. I wanted the author to expose more hypocrites before I was finished."
1,product doesn't match with what photo shows,"the product i received doesn't match with what photo shows and differs from the one i bought before. i cant tell the difference from ""3 Pack Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle 8 oz"", which is much cheaper."
1,HOW DARE YOU CALL YOUR ALBUM ROCK AND ROLL JESUS,Motley Crue are and will always be the rock genius's God is God kid rock should not have called his album that. White Trash
2,not the best but very good,"I've played some previous version of ddr and always loved them. as it's getting bigger in the states they are including some more american music, which isn't the best selection on their part. I bought this for my girlfriend who fell in love with ddr extreme at a friends party. so she's pretty new to it and while the beginner level is great, the levels progress a bit too quick. all in all though it is a blast! but don't buy cheap pads ($9.95 ea)! ours are warping already :/"
1,Tired exotica,"Let's be real. What gives this movie its ""charm"" is the fact that it plays on and reinforces every Western bias about the dangerous ""otherness"" of African culture. If you must, watch it for its cinematography and haunting score, but don't kid yourself about why it is so ""thrilling."""
1,Just a Bunch of Lists,"I thought I was buying a ""family organizer"" (i.e, a family calendar). This book just had a bunch of useless generic lists with a nice cover and fancy tabs."
2,4 and a Half Stars...,"I got Beach Spikers after hearing mixed reviews about it, not sure if I'd love it or hate it. But anyways, I got it, and it's a very nice game. Here's my ratings for each major thing:Graphics- The graphics are very detailed. The player models are very well done, and the minute details, like footprints in the sand, are nice effects. 8.6/10Play Control- There are four buttons on the GameCube for a reason, and Beach Spikers doesn't take advantage of that, but the control is still fairly easy to pick up and understand. 7.9/10Game Design- How many volleyball games are out there? Not many, and this one's chock full of stuff, like a Career Mode and a handful of minigames. 8.2/10Satisfaction- When you're playing the game, you're usually having fun, even when you're losing. That alone is worth a rent. 8.1/10Sound- The sound effects are kinda nice, but an announcer could've added something. 7/10Overall- Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a noteworthy game to at least rent."
2,Awesome DVD,"I don't know why everyone is complaining, this DVD is amazing. The Pixies are amazing. The sound quality isn't bad I don't know what that one guy was talking about. If you like the Pixies, if just a little bit, this DVD will make you happy. There doesn't need to be any extras, there's over 2 hours of quality live music for a low price. GO BUY THIS NOW!"
2,A Bit Outdated,"Anthony does a great job of laying out methods for paying debt down. As with most financial books, this one out dates quickly, but the author provides some timeless advice. When read in conjunction with other financial help books, Anthony's ""Debt-Free by 30"" helps round one's understanding of paying off debt."
2,One of the greatest books in the world!,This book was one of the greatest books I've ever read. William Shatner has become my favorite author. I can not explain in words how good this book was. I would have given it 6 stars if it had been possible.
2,Sheer Pantyhose,"I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose and thigh highs, I have been wearing them for about 15 years. They look and feel good on my legs and under my clothes. They are very sheer and sexy. I can wear them all day and they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles. They are also very durable, I usually get 5 or more wearings out of every pair.I used my Amazon Prime membership for the shipping and received free 2 day shipping. The packages arrived on time and in good shape."
1,Errors.,"So many errors. I highly recommend the reading of this book, but not the Kindle version. Purchase his actual book."
2,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt: The Complete Series,This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I really hope their is a season 2.
2,Great selection of 9 inch blocks,"This book has a great variety of 9 1/2"" blocks (9 inch finished). If you wanted to make a block a different size you'd have to redraft it. Many beginning and intermediate piecing classes teach students to make a sampler from 9"" blocks. This book is a natural next step to continue adding to one's repertoire without having to experiment with too-tiny pieces. An excellent book for different sized blocks is ""Around the Block with Judy Hopkins"". I found it to be a good companion to ""Block Party""."
1,WHAT'S UP PLAYBOY?,"The film takes place in MIA and uses a lot of street language as the make the ice so they can get the paper or cheese. The movie looks like an HBO street documentary with poor camera angles and talking to people like ""Whypp"" ""Pyg"" ""Dog"" or ""Mooch."" But clearly it is not a real street film as the camera shows you both ends of a telephone conversation. The plot involves some home boys dealing drugs in the street, telling the guys that work for them they owe them for all the drugs no matter what happens. It feigns some politically commentary when it mentions the disparity of jail time for crack vs. cocaine.There are drug deals gone bad, deals with Latinos and a ""cracker"" but no real plot, just a slice of life. No character build-up and minimal plot.Written, directed, produced, music score by and starring Tony Mashino.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity."
2,Gorgeous Fine China,This is the china set my husband and I chose. It is beautiful and high quality. It is a classic pattern that I can proudly pass on to future generations. I'm quite disappointed that it is discontinued.
1,Not good,It went bad and smelled like it was on fire. Sent it back I sent it to my sister and this happened to her.It really scared her.
1,If I wanted to be preached at . . .,"I wish I would have read the one star reviews before purchasing this book. I am very glad I only paid $1 plus shipping.I'm 1/3 into it and I can't even read each paragraph because of the non-stop preaching. If I wanted to be banged with a bible, I'd hang out with my in-laws. Good grief, man, what if I was a buddhist? or Jewish? and I just wanted to read a book that would help me with the subject title???This book is totally obnoxious. The few trinkets of real information are repeated over and over, spread thinly between bible quotes and scriptures. Unless you're looking to get preached at, I would highly advise against this waste of paper and text."
1,The best is yet to come,"[...] I don't like the A side of this CD at all. I guess I've heard the Winners version so many times now it's just not the same. The B side however I like. I have the B side in my IPOD. I would give the B side a 4 star rating but the A sides a no show for me personally. If Bo had done SHA for the A side, now that would have been awesome!. Sense I'm being honest, being that I don't like the A side I would have to give this a 2.5 star rating. I'm looking forward to his fall release because the man can sing!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this program and expected to have a complete program, I subsequently found that the program lacked key elements to function correctly, I needed to purchase an mp3 encoder update to use the save operation for my music track costing and additional $14.99, I subsequently attempted to purchase the en-coder upgrade online, Magix.com took my credit card information and thanked me. I have not received any e-mails like the program promise containing unlocking codes. ""Note"" these codes were promised within minutes. I have made (2) unsuccessful telephone calls to Magix, still no unlock codes. I therefore requested an RMA number to return the program still no response. I strongly recommend against purchasing anything from Magix, Their Advertising information is mis-leading. Grady."
1,Don't Torture Youself,This is by far and away the worst Triple Crown book ever. I don't know how a book can be published with words like open being mispelled. The book was double spaced which I really don't understand and I found that truly distracting. From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid. Please don't waste 15 dollars and I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library. This is the worst Triple Crown book ever.
2,Excellent printer for the money!,"I had the use of this model Brother laser printer as editor of my club newsletter. When I gave up the job the printer, which was owned by the club, went to the new editor. I liked this machine so much and missed it so much that I ordered one for myself. It is fast and efficient at printing double sided and collated pages."
2,Works as Well as the Name Brands,The only real attraction of this item is its price. It is less explensive than the name brands but works just as well in my Seiko label printer. I am going to keep using them.
1,Doesn't Play,Looks to be scratched and does not play on XBOX or computer. I'm sure the content is great but we can't see it.
2,"GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON, but PRODUCT NOT THE GREATEST","This is a decent price for these refills, and the free shipping is definitely nice. My only problem with these packets is that they don't last very long. They have been lasting approx. 2 wks per pack - so that adds up. They just don't hold very much toothpaste. But the toothpaste that they do contain, the fresh mint, is very good - good tasting and goes well with the sonicare.PROS: Tastes good, good price.CONS: Doesn't last long."
1,broken and doesn't play any music,the accordion arrived with a piece floating around inside. we tried to fix it but we could hardly get a sound out of it. we returned it!
2,Old School meets New School!!!!,"All the music lovers at our house will own their own copy of this one, 'cause mom's tired of sharing! Those slick guitar riffs from Carlos that rock the house and bring out the air guitar in everyone, tropical latin tracks that make you want move, rap, soul and more... It's probably one of the most diverse CDs we own and one of Carlos' best ever!"
2,Nice Swing! Trick to swinging too fast.,"We loved this swing and so did our daughter. It is nice to have the rotating swing. Our daughter loved the side-to-side motion. When she weighed less we had a problem with it swinging too fast but there is a TRICK... (it mentions it in the manual) you put a light weight blanket under baby and let it barely drag the floor. It works!!! I wouldn't use a heavy blanket or let it bunch up on the floor because it could be hard on the motor.It's easy to fold up and set aside when not in use.The motor is a little loud but baby will get use to it. Our daughter, like some babies, like continous noise when she sleeps anyway."
2,You can't go wrong,.... with a Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Great story. Sheesh. the review has to be a certain amount of words? Read MORE!
2,"Let's Go, Robbie Race Car","If you enjoyed Little Clown Car's Big Day, you and your kids will certainly enjoy this interactive book. Half the fun is making sure your child 'toots' (squeezes) the horn at the right place while each of you read along. In the story Robbie Race Car #1 begins as the race strong and vibrant and finishes the race and learns what it means to be a REAL winner! If your children enjoy cars, they will certainly bring this book to you to read many times..."
1,One lousy book...,"Besides being disjointed and poorly written, it had a big build-up conspiracy that floundered and died. We also found perversions that had nothing what-so-ever to do with the story. And the story - What story?Kay and Lucy did *a little* investigating, and we already knew who the killer was! A complete waste.Worst book I've ever read. I'll never read another Cornwell novel."
2,not bad at all,"Definitely helps with maneuvering the sound around the way you want to hear it, and also helps with vibration if speakers are on a desk"
1,small Child sized/ or extra small head and or no hair,"I guess if you have a tiny head and no hair this might fit. Otherwise this is too small. But, If you have no hair, then why would you need this? It hurts getting it on and off, and is simply too small."
2,"Wana Learn JavaScript, Buy This Book",I am very impressed with this book. I think the author did a great job on it. His secure site idea is a great one and helps to keep myself updated with the JS technology. I have cut and pasted lots of his code from the CD (the CD has over 100s of code as the author promises). The book does not talk about other technologies and explain JS syntax and examples in a very easy to understand manner. A must buy!!!
2,Works as intended,"I like the Topeak line of products. Well builtand good customer support. Works well as a fender,also. I leave it on my bike, even when I'm not usingthe pack."
2,Liked It,The author gave loads of his own experience but it would have been nice to have more history and legend
1,Horrible paint quality,"No problem with shipping and putting together, however, after approximately one month of placing them on our covered front porch the paint started to peel badly. If you sit in the chair and rest your arm, the paint particles stick to your skin. I can't believe this is happening when the chairs are brand new! The chairs were Christmas gifts from family out of town. I hope they don't see the chairs anytime soon as they already look about five years old!! How can I contact the company??????????"
1,This work obfuscates the true essence of taichi.,"The author purportedly wanted to explore the martial applications of tai chi chuan; however, his understanding of the subject matter appears to be inadequate. In the most crucial areas, his explanations are often obscure, and worse, incorrect. This is a good book if you want to pick up some rudimentary ideas about the vocabulary of higher levels of tai chi, but it does not get to the true essence of the well guarded secrets of tai chi as a powerful martial art."
2,trusted friend,I used the vhs Shape your body when it first came out for years and it did shape my body in all the right places. I love it!
1,blah,"I didn't purchase this album but I borrowed it from my dad out of curiosity. I must say that James Blunt is one of those types of artists that seems to have it all....(ie cool voice, emotional lyrics etc) however his ability to write a catchy song (save You're Beautiful) is simply void. Someone in this list of reviewers compared him to Elton John. LOL....That's a good one. This disk isn't horrible. But it's not particularly inspiring either. Nothing on the disk motivates me to listen a 2nd or 3rd time.By the way, we were unfortunate enough to get the CD with the f-word explicative in the song, You're Beautiful, which blared out with our 3 kids listening in the car. Thanks alot, James."
2,An amazing story full of the truth that no one faces,"Not very many people face and recognize how many teenagers face pregnancy. But Plummer has told so trufully a story of one of the many teenagers that are told that they are pregnant. I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down, not even to eat and sleep! I love how Plummer has told this story with not only two peoples point of views, but three. This book is truly amazing!"
2,Great replacement belt!,"This belt replaces one that was damaged when a zinc pot-metal motor sheave split and chewed it up in less than a minute of operation. With a new cast-iron sheave installed, this belt should last a long time."
2,Anthem,"Anthem's language and style are the reasons for its very real narration, but I was left unsatisfied with the conclusion. Although it wasn't meant to be a book read for its plot, it left too much undone. I felt like too much was being crammed into the last two chapters, like it was just an effort to make the book end sooner."
1,Stole sweetness,"Gently grating vocals paired with muted melodies and tourist techno, exploiting a sort of generic emo-prog, keep tame connections at bay."
2,Great hit with my kids!,We bought this for my son and daughter (ages 1 and 3) and they absolutely LOVE it!!! He stands in the corner of my son's room but both children HAVE to go over to pet him and talk to him daily. Wonderfully well made animal...amazing price for such an awesome product. Highly recommend!
2,Cowboy Geology at its best,"Discover or rediscover the excitement of geology with John McPhee as he travels the west with geologist Kenneth S. Deffeyes. As they explore the geological past in the American present you never know what will happen or where they will take you. They may get rich at an old silver mine, discover a past or future ocean, or touch an angular unconformity. To some extent they do all of this and to give a history of geology at the same time.The author effectively conveys the violence, drama, and epic immediacy of geological study. I look forward to future geological travels through his books."
2,Works on little rodents,I used a B&D EX900-A-TP1 till it died and I know that worked as it was once turned off in the garage and I had the spring loaded traps still set along the walls...sure enough caught one. I then ended up buying this new EP1100-A as a replacement and haven't had a problem either. Keeps the rodents out of the garage and prevents them from creating havoc on the cars.
2,Make a pot of wedding soup and then read this book!,"Capturing the true essence of what it means to be of Italian-American descent and from Youngstown, Ohio, the author paints a richly moving accout of family life during the first half of the twentieth century. Through laughter and tears, I read about Jo, the protagonist whose faith and strenghth never fail. This ""universal"" story played out in many of the homes on Rose Street or on Dearborn Street where my family history began. We learn from Jo and from our grandparents that the struggle to preserve our family and its heritage provides riches a banker can never count. Their experiences so move and inspire us to hold dear all that is truly important: love, loyalty and a true committment to family."
1,Not the real thing,"What I received was not the real ""Realities by Liz Claiborne"" but a fake product in packaging that was made to resemble the real thing (but was not the real packaging). Seller should alert people that what they're getting is a knock off, not the real thing. It doesn't even have the same smell. This was a big disappointment. I would not buy from this seller again."
2,Body Ecology Super Green,I am going thru Chemo right now and need this product to help my digestive system maintain a well balanced flora. I am also using this product to bring my body back to an alkalyne state. I'm sure I can accomplish this using Donna's Gates products. I love Body Ecology and recommend any of these types of products.
2,very strong drill bits,"Very standard set of drill bits, but they do their job and are very high quality. I am very happy with this product"
1,A no good canopener.,"The on & off switch positivly did not work.After about a week,I got so disgusted with it Ithrew it in the garbage can.Thats what i thinkabout this product."
1,Poor design -- Ride-On is not so steady,Both my boys tried to ride this over and over with the same results. The ride-on is balanced so that a little too much pressure on the handle bars sends the kids over face first into the floor. I got tired of bruised faces and crying kids and got rid of it. Definitely disappointing.
2,Not All Known To Me Prior To Purchase.,"Some of the 16 tracks are quite well known to me, including Jesus Is Just Alright by The Doobie Brothers and Laser Love by After The Fire.The former may not indicate the band's personal spiritual postion, however this song could easily be covered by a Christian artist with excellent results.Johnny Cash certainly did that with Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.There are two songs by Kerry Livgren of Kansas, Slow Motion Suicide and To Live For The King, both sung from the heart.Musically Roy Buchanan's The Messiah Will Come Again is very good, only I struggle to hear the lyrics, Alice Copper's Nothing's Free has a suitably menacing tone and The Call's The Walls Came Down is possibly the standout from this collection.Some of the remainder are middling, but overall this is well worth owning."
1,Defective,This worked very well for the first 2 weeks. Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers. I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars.
2,amazing,"all of impaled is fire this album is fire as well if you are a fan of carcass, exhumed, or ghoul this is crucial and you must own it"
1,Grammar for Language Arts Teachers,"This book is a little overwhelming at first glance. The authors state that the intended audience is for language arts teachers. I think that it may be more useful for high school teachers. The language in the book is not conducive to early learners or for people who speak English as their second language. As you learn and struggle through the middle chapters, you find yourself starting to understand more of what the book was trying to say in the first chapters. Therefore I think that Chapters 10 and 11 should be the first chapters in this book. I have heard somewhere that a writer should revise first, and then get down and dirty with grammar. Chapter 11 is about revising, which is why I think it should be first and not last.This book was fairly confusing to me; the examples in the chapters were not the best to use for classes. All in all, I would recommend this book for a reference book, but definitely not for a classroom instructional book."
2,This is a fantastic product!,I've paid a lot more for others that do not work half as well as these do. Happy with purchase!
1,its a bore,"i am star wars fan.this book [...].it is very boring.if you are a star wars fan,you already know all the stuff in the book.it will collect dust in your room.david west donalds is weird to write this book.you will get no info from this book.do not waste your 15 dollars.buy somthing like the star wars triligy collection.it is very good.there are many star wars books out there.please do not waste your $$$$$$$$."
2,Packed with suspense to the fullest!!!,"A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."
1,I have to give this a star?,"I bought this mop and returned it after its first use. The mop head popped off multiple times in the midst of mopping after securing it properly. The engineer in the house interjected a second opinion said it didn't look very functional either. Thank you, Bed, Bath and Beyond for making the return painless."
1,Movies Lie,"Do not be fooled by this product. I bought this along with four terrapins and a rat (since I couldnt lay my hands on a warthog and a rhino). I rubbed this product into my skin and gums then rolled around with the terrapins and the rat.Long story short I did NOT end up with my own crime-fighting mutant superhero team. The rat bit me and I crushed the terrapins. Also I now have a strange rash and Im coughing up blood, whats up with that?Avoid."
1,very poor,Colloquial Cambodian......A complete course if you happen to buy the book too. CD pack is usless by itself. Have to buy the book too. A great marketing ploy by Mr Smyth.CD wastes alot of time.... keeps saying... In this lesson 16 we will explore....blah blah.. Then In this next lesson number 17 we shall look at exercise 22 in the book.....( if you happen to have the book). You just hear alot of Khmer words with no English to explain what they are saying. CD has no order. Very poor to try to learn any words....even like Hello or thankyou. If you want to learn Khmer... dont buy this. To waste even more time it even has several interviews (all in Khmer) about how difficult it was to farm under the Lon Nol Goverment...blah blah blah.. More of a History lesson Than a Language program. To understand the interviews you have to be Khmer as there is no English translations. ( or perhaps thats written in a different book that you have to buy aswell.)
2,My 2rd one,Works great for me the only thing is that the light comes on when pushing something heavy.
1,Wasn't as expected!,"I picked this radio after many hours of going over reviews. When I openned the package it felt cheap! The band selector moved up and down with too great of easy. Didn't know which band I was in. Am reception was good. FM reception was excellent. Shortwave reception was terrible in my house, regardless of the room I went to. The reason I returned it was that it would not shut off. I had to remove the batteries to shut it off!Now looking for a portable shortwave radio again."
1,"Once fully charged, won't hold charge for any length of time.","Ok, I figure, being a Lenmar brand, the battery should hold a charge,but it doesn't.I figure I'll give it a complete charge and discharge a few times and a month to determine how reliable the battery is, before any reviews.After you fully charge it, it will work, but don't expect same power length as your original.Also, if you have it fully charge and let it sit for a week, without use, the battery will show empty, when you try to play it.So if you are going to use it, you must charge it the night before. Kind of a pain.One note, to replace the battery was pretty easy, just watch the videos online, took about 10min."
1,Not The Good Grunge I was Hopein' 4!!,"What is down?? First off I love grunge rock, its dark brooding power cords define my tortured life and I love playing it on a sunny day while I golf with friends at the country club. Anyhoo, a friend told me I shood check out Pearl Jam and said I should play their new one they just putt out with a dvd called ""10"". Wow, this was nothing like the good grunge bands, the singer is indescipherable, the guitarists play no good memorable rifts, and the drumber is just hitting old peanut butter cans, gross!! LOOK People, stick with TRU grunge bands, you know bands like Puddle Of Mudd, Nickleback, Theory Of A Deadman, 3 Days Grace, Default and Mudvayne. Go Bengals, 2009 Football Champs, Who-Dey!!"
2,Didn't See This Ending Coming,I won't blather on as there are other reviews here. I would give it 4 stars. DHP's Yale talent acting + a great ending is worth your time.
2,My granddaughter loves it!,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, age 5. She loves to play with it and has had hours of fun with it. It is ratherflimsy made, the windows & doors don't stay in but that doesn't botherher. Overall, I am very glad I got it."
2,need to find a song title and artist name,i was wondering if anyone new the name of the song and the artist name of the song playing when quincey and monica make love for the first time I love the music and can't figure out what its called please e-mail me with the title at sundae7786@aol.com
1,back with the boys again?,"hmmm this was a let down. i really can't comprehend why ol fagin made an all the best album when there aren't any ""best"". if this cd was called all the gay, it might be ok. BUT NOT! Fagin is at his worst here and this cd will make you cry, if your lucky enough to not have your ears bleed. May this cd die."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ???,"I DON'T KNOW WHO THE CLOWN IS THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE RECORDING RELEASE OF MICHAEL BUBLE, BUT THE MUSIC PUBLIC IS GOING TO REBEL AGAINST THE PROCESS HE SEMS TO BE USING . THIS LATEST RELEASE ARE SONGS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND RELEASED . I THINK HIS VOICE AND PRESENTATION IS TERRIFIC , BUT ALONG WITH HIS OTHER RELEASES(INCLUDING THE CHRISTMAS ALBUM OF 4 OR 5 SONGS THAT AMAZON SAID""NOT AVAILABLE TILL DEC. 24"" THIS IS A JOKE) I HEARD HIS FIRST RELEASE AND IT WAS GREAT . HIS SECOND( WAS APOLOGIZED FOR BY M.B.) WE SAW HIM IN PERSON AT THE KING CENTER IN MELBOURNE , FLORIDA. THIS IS A GREAT TALENT GONE AWRY BY HIS HANDLERS .J.L.MURRAY"
1,Listening To Static On The Radio Would Be The Same,These folks have two zeros. Zero for talent. Zero for brains.This is not music-it is noise. Just like the noise a failingbearing makes in a car or other machine.Do not waste your money on this trash.These folks must be laughing all the way to the bank.
1,I'm left feeling sour...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
2,love it,"the case fits my 14"" widescreen laptop perfectly. It also looks nice, was a great bargain, and fits a ton of other textbooks/folders in the storage compartment. I think this is a great buy. The engineering and appearance of the bag gives it a look of quality. highly recommended."
2,Punk and Its After Shocks review,"i thought this was a very good video if your a true punk fan. Really catches the image, bands and feeling of the new wave punk. I thought it was a very good video but i gave it 4 stars because of the exesive cursing."
1,Bootleg,I purchased this because of the picture and that it said it was the official headband. I was shipped a bootleg headband that was falling apart upon opening the package. Very disappointed.
1,The dumbest Offspring product in the world!,"I hate this!There is no music at all.Its just a boring interview cd.Its just an interview you listein to!I bought it because it was a bargain,I thought it would be worth it...But no!It ...Do not buy it."
2,A Real Taste of Ireland,"I was given a subscription as a gift back in 1995 and have been receiving this publication ever since.The articles are varied and extremely well written. You'll find subjects as predictable as the life of St Patrick and how Waterford crystal is made to how bogs are formed and the treasures that lie within them. The photography will make you want to visit every square inch of the country and you'll think the colors have been enhanced by computer but, if you go, you'll find they are true to life!One of my favorite regular articles is by Christopher Moriarty who suggests interesting travel on Ireland's lesser known roads in Byways rather than Highways. You can (and I do) use these ideas for trips around the country while finding out interesting facts about places most tour buses pass quickly by.I look forward every other month to finding this magazine in the mail. Subscriptions for other magazines have come and gone but this is one I'll be getting for a long time coming."
2,I LOVE GHOST HUNTERS!,"If you haven't watched this show at all and you are interested in the paranormal, what are you waiting for? This is, in my opinion, the best paranormal show. I can't wait for Wednesday's at 9PM to watch this show! You never know what's going to happen or what they may find. The St. Augustine Lighthouse episodes are my favorite. What they capture on video is just astonishing! I could probably talk all day about the EVPs I've heard from this show. I can't wait for Season 4 to kick off!!!"
1,THIS BOOK IS NOW 0UT-DATED,"The belief that the G-spot does not exist is just as dogmatic as the insistance that it does! I suppose if the book gets people to talk and explore, it is almost worth the money, but every woman needs to find out about her own body, by herself and with her partner, and not try to live up the to expectations portrayed in this book - like the myth that G-spot stimulation will inevitably lead to a female ejaculation. Forget the super-sex pressures of sex books like this and just explore."
2,"Wesley Dennis, Country to the Core","On April 9th, 2005 Wesley Dennis and his bnad Country to the Core played at Alcazar Shriners for a 'Country Western Cookout' I was in New York State. On Monday April 11th, I received a report from my office assisant about the dinner/dance. I was told that the food was good the band was loud, but the singer was GREAT!! I knew that this would be the case as this is not the first time I have booked Wesley Dennis to play at Alcazar.I look forward to the next time I book Wesley for our place. I am listening to one of his CD's at the present. Excellent!!"
1,Works- sort of,"I got an Opteka T-mount to adapt a reflective telephoto lens for my Canon. It arrived with the lens and seemed fine, sturdy and well fitted. While it worked properly at first, after a couple of days the inner threaded sleeve came loose from the outer housing, allowing the lens to rotate freely and wobble a bit. It still holds the lens on the camera but makes the lens unreliable; I've ordered a replacement (from a different vendor) that hopefully will hold together."
2,It really is good.,I have no complaints about any of the acting whatsoever. Also the direction is flawless and the vibe is genuine. A little disturbing too perhaps. Cement your dissension towards neo corporate cinema and add another gem to your collection with this one!
2,This is the consumate Christmas Album,"If you want the true spirit of Christmas with choral music both sacred and contemporary....(for the 1950's) with a touch of nostalgia from a simpler time, this is the album for you and your family. With a tenor that can sing like an angel and the rest of the choir of solo quality, yet blending so wondrously....keep this cd in your collection. It's the best every made."
1,Horrible,"This movie is horrible. The storyline starts of slow and the fight scenes are repetitive, uninteresting and bland. A muay thai autistic star? cmon thats garbage!!!"
2,An easy to follow guide but very POWERFUL,This book will help to learn to instill in students the art of appreciating reading and enhance their writing skillls.
1,It Stinks,"Absolutely lousy. This is a photocopy of what was a marvelous original, and the photocopy stinks. This is unfortunate, as the content is very worthwhile."
1,To Follow Michael Acuna's Review Is One Big Challenge!,"Although I totally disagree with his descriptive adjectives over earlier, Michael Caine...that Jude Law's version of Alfie is all three: ""watered-down, scrubbed and sanitized"" gigolo/playboy in relating to healthy Lassies, Sienna, Marisa & Susan, it appears to me that each one used him in widely divergent ways!I cannot agree with any reviewer that Jude Law remotely fulfills his ""sanitized, scrubbed, watered-down"" idea of this obsessive, compulsive character; Even with an over-healthy, wealthy, Susan Sarandon! In fact, his escapades left me unimpressed, under-sea, at-odds with Director Shyer's Movie! Enough...an older retired, Chaplain Fred W Hood"
2,An office necessity.,"I have owned the clip-on type of this Air King 6"" fan for awhile and decided I could also use a table type to put on top of my computer tower. Don't know how I got along without this fan. It is quieter than a whisper and performs well with two speeds of airflow. One negligable drawback is that it takes two hands to turn it on and off; the unit could use a push-button switch. Over all a very good deal for the comfort it provides. The price was right and the item was shipped to my door, no lengthy shopping trip needed. Prepare for a grounded three-prong plug, OK?"
1,disappointed,"I bought this book for my then 15 months old son based on the high percentage of good reviews. But when I received the book I was so disappointed. The pages are thin, the story line is boring (both to my baby and I), and the flaps are too thin and too wide to grab my baby's attention. He looks at it once and almost never picks it up again."
1,Not so good,"Buy these from Private Island on Amazon instead of this seller. They are much better quality and are packaged properly for lens protection.These sunglasses came in a large carton, with little protection material. They were floating around the box in a plastic baggie.I ordered two pair. Both came with scratched lenses and a damaged frame hinge. I don't know if it was because of the way they are packaged. They may be just poor quality from the manufacturer."
1,doesnt really suction.,I bought the 3 bowl set with the hopes that it would hold the bowl to his high chair tray just enough to enable my son to pick out his finger food without spilling all over his lap. Alas it did not. I feel dissapointed that i basically just bought 3 plastic bowls as the suction part is non functional for more than 3 seconds. Ive tried using dampness to create a better seal and its to no avail. my advice? save your money. this is a great idea but someone has yet to put it into practical implementation.
1,Ummm...no.,"What is up with that ridicuolous ""prego rap""?! And the 5 mintues of silent time where all we see is kathy & the others laying on the floor for 5 WHOLE MINUTES! There are parts where the voice is dubbed over, the exercises were not effective AT ALL & the arm moves get a bit confusing at times. I just didn't find myself sweating or even feeling somewhat energized after this routine...I felt cheated. Like I needed more. It is way too outdated too. I almost wanna call it lame. I DO NOT recommend at all. Obviously I wasn't impressed & will be selling my copy on ebay."
2,No Place To Hide From This Great Book!,"What a fabulous debut by Madalyn Reese. The story of Emma and Anthony is full of action, suspense and a wonderful romance between two people who are destined to be together! Ms. Reese packs a wallop of twists and turns that kept this reader on the edge of her seat until the very end. Well done. What's next?"
1,Poor Quality,"Based on other reviews I must have received one of the few lemons. The trigger button popped off while removing the packing material and would not stay snapped into place when using the saw. I could not get any oil to flow to the chain no matter how hard I pressed. The cutting power even on 4"" limbs seemed weak but this may have also been a lack of chain oil. All in all I was very disappointed with this saw."
2,nice trainer. instructions don't cover it all though,"i just got this trainer and have put about 50 miles on it so far. very nice. great feel. the instructions makes this a 4 star rating. it does a good job explaining/showing how to put it together. what then threw me for a loop was what i was to do with the included skewer and the cup with the skewer adapter. there is zero explanation of what to do, why i should change the skewer, how to change the cup, etc. thankfully, all the explanation i needed for what, why, how was on youtube."
1,WORST PHONE EVER,"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE EVER. DON'T GET TEMPTED BY THE REBATE..THIS PHONE HANGS, DROPS CALLS, VERY SLOW INTERFACE. IT KEEPS HANGING...I AM GOING TO RETURN IT ASAP!(I ALSO HAVE NOKIA 3650 WHICH IS THE GREATEST PHONE I EVER HAD)"
2,"Great for dogs, great for you","My lab/spaniel mix hates this-- but she doesn't like rawhide at all, so we gave it to my mom's shih-tzu and she loves it-- best part is, it makes her breath smell like syrup when she's done"
1,Poor Product,"I ordered this ir for my gransons birthday and the parts didnt fit correctly, one piece had been broken and glued back on it had dents and a gouge around one of the holes to attach one of the rungs. I only paid 14.99 two weeks ago and now they are wanting $39.99! For the quality and what we had to do to fix and assemble this chair this price is outrageous!! Its very soft wood, pine for sure! They need to reapply the $14.99 price for sure not worth a penny over that> Very dissapointed in this chair. Never have I had a bad experience buying from amazon until now. Will be weary of items purchased now."
1,Dissapointing,"I recieved this book as a gift and was SO EXCITED.I wished to learn more about old saddles, dates, maufacturing, types, etc.I was really dissapointed when I sat down to read it.It was very vauge...not at all what I was expecting.And NOT WORTH (the money) (to me)."
2,An excellent and readable book for background studies of NT,"For study of the background of the New Testament, this is a great place to begin. It is readable and interesting. The material is well-organized as well. I highly recommend it."
2,An exceptionally readable book on Kung Fu,"The Spirit of Shaolin is an exceptionally readable book for those interested in discovering Kung Fu. It takes you on one man's journey to finding himself through this practice. That the man happens to be David Carradine, TV's Caine, is an interesting parallel. For those more versed in Kung Fu this book may contain too little, for those who adhere to Bruce Lee and his methods this book may anger, for those of us who are curious and who are an unwritten page ourselves this book is just what the doctor ordered."
2,Fabulous,"I read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. It soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. It took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it."
1,Not Feelin This,I bought this because Bizzy is my favorite rapper. But I didn't enjoy one track from this.
1,I'm not happy with this deal,One of the microphones arrived spoiled. It doesn't run well.It was not a good deal through Amazon web site.
1,Stroller okay... Carseat HORRIBLE!!!!,"We purchased this travel system in another pattern in October 05. I don't mind the stroller, our 6 month old seems very comfortable in it. However, we have had endless problems with the infant seat!!! First of all, you can only use the carseat with the base (there are no slots to slide a seatbelt through on the carseat itself) We have two vehicles and it has been a real pain transfering and readjusting the base everytime! Second, our baby is only 6 months old and 15 pounds and for the last two months has felt too heavy for the seat. We are already seeing white distress marks on the handle! I loved the pattern of the set, and that is unfortunately the only thing I was looking for at the time so, please DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!"
2,Great movie!,"All I can say is the kids love it and we do to! It had my son jumping up and down yelling Go, go, go!!! this was at the end with the big dragon! Fun movie!"
2,"fun, funny, easy read",really enjoyed reading this book as my son was hiking the AT. I was able to relate to the terrain and what he was experiencing when he would call me for his next shipments of food. Very entertaining and funny!
2,"Yes, Yes, Yes","OK, oK, ok ,ok. Now, I can't even begin to write how I feel about this album. It's the best (hands down) the best album Patti's has ever put out in her 40 plus career. I am glad that the true word of a ""Diva"" has been saved by the not so, lost it ""Diva's). She has proven that longivity is the key. And working hard at your dream can be done. Every song on this cd is my favorite. I listen to everyone like it is the bomb.The cd really took me by surprise, because her last 2 efforts were not Patti. This Is Patti. Every key, every chord and just the bomb key changes, I have ever heard come from her. The cd is definitely a Timeless Journey.Thank you Patti. For this. It has really put me in the postion to go forward with my journey as an artist.Love Kenp.s. Whitney, you could learn from this. I know you are going through the pain, but guess what? It is YOU who has to pull it together and make a come back like I know you will."
1,Good Name But,"New Hope isn't really the most haunted town in the US. Frankly I've seen houses with more activity then every historical site in New Hope combined. Don't get me wrong I love New Hope. I grew up their (I still live near by), and I began my lifes work as a ghost hunter in New Hope. The Logan Inn was the first haunted site I ever researched (for a school newspaper article), I've done the ghost tours bit, and been in a lot of the sites on this show. The show though is badly done. Its format is very flat and uninteresting. Like far to many amateurs they obsess over orbs (which are hands down the least interesting and most easily explained of all ""psychic"" photography) and some of there other pictures are questionable as well. I would suggest the books of the late Mary Adi Kent instead of this documentary."
1,Not so easy for beginners,"I expected more. The yarn is fun, pretty & soft; the beads are a neat accent; but it was very difficult for my 9 year old niece to do. She wanted to learn how to crochet, but this was not a good way to start. The description said, ""an easy-to-do craft for beginners,"" but I thought it was more appropriate for those who already know how to crochet. The type of yarn that is provided is really what makes it so tough. My niece wasn't able to see her stitches, let alone count them, and she got frustrated with it and gave up (& she's not one to give up easily)."
2,Fantastic.....If Only,"Criterion has done a beautiful job with this classic. Flawless in every respect. Great supplements. My only complaint, and maybe he was unavailable, is why Billy Chapin, the star of the film is not included in the commentary? What memories and insight he would have into the making of this film. Other than that, Criterion has outdone itself!!"
2,"Gunsmoke - The Second Season, Vol. 1",So glad this season is out on dvd as the guys in my household have been awaiting its release. Split volumes aren't an issue...just glad its available.
2,Great for MRE's or Bug-Out Bags,"I bought this book specifically because I want to make my own MRE's for my Bug-Out Bag. I have food allergies and cannot eat the typical emergency preparedness food. I will be using this book for that (and mine won't look and taste like barf in a bag.)I am so happy for the practical advice and experience of the author. Very helpful. I'm sure I'll be using it for summer fun, too."
2,Gernsheim work is a winner,"Of course the Brahms is a masterpiece and there are many recordings to choose from. But the Gernsheim 2nd string quartet in A minor is a very fine work indeed. Gernsheim was a friend of Brahms and his style certainly reflects his knowing the great master. I play violin and viola and upon hearing this recording I set out to find the music for the Gernsheim quartet - and was successful. I have played it twice (1st viollin once, viola the other time) with 2 different groups, both like it - the second group being professional musicians in the Orquesta Sinfonica de Yucatan. They, in particular, were very much won over by this dramatic work and are eager to play it again. The Manderling quartet play wonderfully on this recording, both the Gernsheim as well as the Brahms. Five stars!"
1,Don't bother,"If there were a way to give this negative stars I would.If you are looking for an electronic babysitter with some educational value, this is the software for you. However, the interface is not intuitive; the voice-overs sound forced; the program is twitchy if you happen to ""leave"" the window during a demonstration or practice.They advertise 3 or more program levels per subject. I have yet to find anything of the sort. The printable worksheets are only useful if you have a printer immediately handy. They do not appear on the screen ever that I have seen. They can _*only*_ be printed out.It's rigid, restrictive and unforgiving."
2,Mean Rythm Indeed.,"This is a classic example of what the good reverend B. Gibbons and his cohorts can dish out when their on the money.With his sharpened Peso pick attacking his guitar strings emitting those signature whistling lead solo's coming at you through several Expandora distortion pedals you know he means business.His voice is as raw as the Grand Canyon,the songs are tight as a closed fist and the drums and bass are funky and primal, what a great combo.Yes indeedy folks it's all there in one neat package, so what are you waiting forhave a sip of Rythmeen you'll feel better for it.Oooohh Yeah!!"
1,Huh? What? What time is it?,"Oh, sorry... fell asleep again. That seems to happen every time I put this on. You know how everyone describes a CD by saying ""this sounds like X crossed with Y?"" Well, watch the 11:10PM weather forecast on a really small market local newscast (preferably where it snows a lot), then filter in a really boring AA meeting, and you'll have ""A Ghost Is Born.""In many Wilco reviews, there are phrases like ""takes a while to sink in"" or ""takes repeated listenings."" That is what people say when they really mean ""this sucks, but I'm going to force myself to like it, since everyone else does."""
1,TOO LONG!,"Certainly this novel contained some interesting and insightful observations about American society, but generally, it disappointed. The ""mystery"" dragged through the first two thirds. Each chapter ended with an annoying pseudo-suspensful sentence that lead... nowhere. There was no character development beyond the initial impressions/sketches of each person, including the protagonist, Talcott, who remained a drip to the end, and his wife, ""Kimmer"", who, impossibly, grew more and more evil with each chapter. (Yet he loves her so!) There were, in fact, too many characters to keep track of or care about, especially in the law school. The political musings detracted from the story rather than adding to it. (At one point, Talcott walks past some sort of sub-par ghetto grammar school, and wishes his colleagues who don't support school vouchers could see this proof of their need. What?) The ending was corny and cliched. And did I mention it was too long?"
1,wendyr,"We purchased this because I wanted a whistling tea kettle. I am very disappointed because after only several months of occasional use, the whistle component has broken off and fallen out of the kettle. It can not be repaired.The look is sleek and the kettle opens automatically when you start to pour but this does not justify the cost, esp, when it does not last!! Find another kettle that costs less!"
1,not worth the time,"i've read all the pendragon books. but when i think about them i can only remember the story up to the middle of the Aurther book, the rest is just a blur. WHEN I TRIED to read this book i found myself getting side-tracked,(for long periods of time i would just sit there and stare at the pages, or the wall), this book is really boring. After 2 years i'm on page 45 or 50 or something. And i can't stand the christian theme. i don't beleive in god so i can't relate to this book."
2,The strongest book of the series,The third book of the Witches of Eileanan series is the strongest with Isabeau asserting herself and running afoul of the Righ by stealing Bronwen.The more we see of Maya and her machinations the more fascinating she becomes. Isabeau's finding of her mother and father and the battle with the Mesmearden are strong elements of the story. The remnants of the AWL hold a powerful resonance of contemporary society and the intolerances inherent.There are three more books to come. ...
1,"very poor low budget production, what a shame","very disappointed as i watched it. very few footages, just 3 or 4 being interviewed, filling up the videos with ridiculous, stupid, low budget pictures to fill the gaps between interviews (i can do this on my own!!! just simple editting and visual effects!!!). i think what syd's fans want to see most is first hand materials, not all these meaningless craps just to fill up the screen. what a shame! it's like using syd's fame to earn money by producing such a poor quality product."
1,terrible,"HELLO LOSERSthis cd is a dud,does music get any worse than this NO,NOT AT ALL.IS THERE ANTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS CD,NO ABSOLUTELY NOT.please dont waste your money on this awful cd.there is better music out there.DONT BUY THIS CD.adios BOBBY BROWN."
2,BEST PEN EVER,"This is a great pen, I can use it to write notes directly in my bible and it drys super fast so doesn't bleed through. It's great for note taking. I have not found a pen to replace it and it is no longer stocked in regular stores. AMAZON thanks a bunch for stocking this item, it's great !!"
2,great mask,I ordered two mask they arrived three days early. Great quality I'm not sure of the filters but they are expired I expected to purchase new ones any way. Very easy to put on and adjust. The drinking straw is a little short but a neat extra. Seals tight no leeks in either. I also purchased two children size also just as good.
1,What a waste of money,"When I first new that Gamecube was coming out, I imagined it would be great. I bought it with Luigis Mansion. THE GAME WAS...So then I purchased other games, that were same stupid thing (except for Rogue Squadron and Smash Bros.)Then I started to get information about PS2.So I purchased PS2 and bought Metal Gear Solid 2, AND IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER!! I sold the Gamecube and the games and started trying the PS2 games and almost every game I played was excellent!!. Also, Playstation has 4 new games at the speed tha the gamecube has 1!!.The only good thing Nintendo is doing laslty is the Game Boy Advance.BUY PS2!!"
2,********* READ THIS ******************,"This item only works with Logitech brand keyboards. From the reviews seems like the buyers have not done the proper research and Amazon description does not state that either.So, unless you have a Logitech brand keyboard this item will not work for you.Hope this helps those that are still looking"
2,What a joy!!!,"This is a MUST for Africans and Lovers of African music! It's not only the marvellous work of Paul Simon,but of other artists,specially Myriam Makeba and the FABULOUS Ladysmith Black Mambazo. You feel the love,and almost...the smell of Africa!"
2,It's Disneyland at home!,"I bought this game for myself, I'm a Disneyland nut! We go at least once a year, so this is great to fill in the time between visits. We play as a family, we love it. My kids are 6 and 3, they really get into the game. It helps get your kids involved in planning and thinking ahead. Although many of the rides are not in the same places as they are at Disneyland. The goal of the game is to go to all your attractions and get back to the front gate 1st. It's a great game for the family and for Disney lovers of all ages. A great way to spend family time, even if you are not at Disneyland."
1,He's Craaaaazy!,"Kevin Trudeau's Weight Loss Cure is great bathroom-reading material. I found it to be an easy read, but would not personally subscribe to the ""cure"", which I consider to be such drastic measures."
2,Fleetwood Mac,"Fleetwood Mac is definitely one of my favorite musical groups of all time, and this is one of the best, if not the best, CD that you can have of them.I can't say anything other than everything in this CD is wonderful. Get it, trust me. You'll find a favorite among this collection."
2,Action Packed,Action packed from start to finish! Leaves you waning more. Really good movie. Worth renting or buying. Great gift. Loved it.
1,you will learn,"you all should have known but will soon learn that Nelly is Garbage and always will be. If you didn't know he whas garbage before he released these albums then you should have checked the CD out on ""The Leak"" on MTV.com and you would have realized it real fast. I'm sorry if you already wasted your money on this garbage but if you haven't hopefully I will save you $20. You all are welcome"
1,A Stretch,"I did not read the previous book, so context was difficult to attain until I read half way through. The entire concept seemed highly implausible! l know its fiction but there has to be some foundation in reality. The whole witch thing, demons that fly, ancient worlocks? The setting was also a problem for me Florida then DC then back to Florida. Disappointed."
2,Sony's got a winner,"This is an excellent system. The sound stage on this system is excellent, its quite versatile, you can hook it up to video game systems, dvd players etc. Excellent dolby surround, plus 60 cd space is hard to beat, I love how this system looks the colorful display it's just like a mini jukebox. 225 watts, excellent price....I love it....I give it 5 stars...Sony rocks"
2,Beating up a buddy never felt so good,"Great boxing game. I don't think I'll ever get enough of the slo-mo knockout replays. The graphics are incredible. The controls are smooth and easy. I only give 5 stars to the greatest games but anything 4 stars and up is definitely worth buying. Play with a friend and it's much more enjoyable although the single player mode is plenty enough to make it a good investment. Being able to pick and challenge legends like Ali and De La Hoya is tasty icing on the cake. (Where's George Foreman?)Improvements should be made on the commentaries though as they tend to cut off in the middle before and after instant replays. That and I think my coach in the corner has given me the exact same lines after every round for the past ten fights. Other than that, great game."
2,Different but good!,"A really different show that will rock your world with its twisty storyline and great editing. I didn't expect much when I bought this but I like scary stuff. It proved to be so much more than just another ""horror"" story."
2,very sweet,"Tulku Urgyen was a fine example of a true yogi.His devotion to his teachers shines through in these pages, and there's more to be learned here than just the verbal info.I highly recomend keeping this book around."
2,Easy to use alarm clock,I got this alarm clock to replace one that was too bright at night. This is great. No frills and is a bit hard to see in very bright light during the day. But easy to see at night and you can dim it so that it doesn't interfere with sleep. Very happy with the purchase.
2,Great Escape,Two of my favorite actors - Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig - are in one movie. How cool is that!! It's a great movie to watch when you just want to leave reality for a while.
2,Timely Delivery,Product was everything promised and was sent in a very timely manner. will look to use again if needed.
2,Electric Blower/Vacuum,"The vacuum / blower works great however after the bag starts to fill up it gets very uncomfortable to carry, the weiget seems to go right to the small of the back."
1,Not an 8 inch pan,"I am single, so I use two fry pans; a six inch, and an eight inch, but I use the eight inchthe most and just buy the cheap Farberware pan at WalMart and toss it once a year when thenon-stick surface becomes a stick surface but thought this was not good for the environment,so went for this pan due to the good reviews.HAY GUYS, THIS IS NOT AN EIGHT INCH PAN!My six inch lid fits fine on this seven inch pan.It measures 7-1/2"" ID, 7-3/4"" OD. Nowhere does it measure eight inches.An eight inch fry or saute pan ID should always measure close to eight inches, this pan does not, and is much closer to my 6"" pan than my eight inch pan.It is going back and I will pick up my third cheapo pan from WalMart."
1,"Save your money, buy a game","I broke down and bought a game shark (way overpriced) only for it to tell me that it was not compatible with my system. Apparently, I needed to buy an upgrade cd. For how much I have no idea because I brought it back, got my money back and bought a game."
2,BEST SELF-HELP BOOK I EVER READ!,"THIS BOOK IS ONE THAT YOU CAN REFER TO OVER AND OVER. SHEGIVES SO MUCH INSITE TO HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF A BETTERPERSON. SHE DOESN'T PREACH TO YOU ABOUT ANY RELIGION BEINGBETTER THAN ANY OTHER, JUST LETS YOU KNOW THAT GOD LOVES YOUNO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. THIS IS DEFINATELY A BOOK TO READ."
1,Disappointing,"Too much bass, weak mid-range. Music sounds muddled and lacks clarity. Imaging is OK. Maybe good for hard rock and heavy metal, but not suitable for classical music, country, jazz etc. Bose MediaMate is better."
1,too long,"I would give this book 2.5 stars(why doesn't amazon offer the option of 1/2 star?)At the end of this book, it became more fast paced. But she could definitely have cut out a good 100 pages or more and it wouldn't have ruin the story. I decided to skim through page 250-400 or so, just reading the dialogue. I'm finding some of Sandra Brown's books to be long winded, while others are really good and the perfect length. Total hit or miss. Nothing out of the ordinary, this is just a typical murder mystery,other reviewers can go over the plot for you."
1,Would not purchase this if you want good sound quality,Poor sound quality - no adjustments for treble or bass - sounds cheap and tinny. Returned this product for refund.
2,California Rock,"It is so hard to believe it, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers still have maintained their rock edge for almost 25 exciting years, and they still have the appeal of making some great pop songs. Their latest single is definitely no acception to that rule. Dani California, the first single from the chilis' latest record Stadium Arcadium is a great song that is just driven, upbeat, and worth every bit of what the group has brought as their best within the past several years of following the success of tracks like Californication, Can't Stop, and By The Way. I absolutely like this song a lot, because it is just great to listen to. I just hope that more funky rock will continue from this legendary party group.Song: B 1/2+"
2,Fun JD Robb mystery with her great twists,"If you like the J.D Robb mysteries, you will enjoy this story. Quick read, but includes all of her twists and challenges. I enjoyed that it was also ""out of this world"". :)"
1,Not ready for prime time,"I work for a well known computer store which I shall not name so that it is understood this opinion is mine.Having had to deal with NIS2004 and NIS2005 on 6 different customer 's systems we lose more time trying to either deinstall and reinstall the software after the customer has purchased and tried to install it, or because the product simply stopped working. I certainly would not reccomend the purchase of this product by a novice or anyone other than someone advanced enough to edit the registry to completely remove all traces of the product in the event of the need to reinstall.Norton should also do something about their ""hit or miss"" activation system. It has taken me up to 10 try to activate the product. In fact, only once have I had the activation occur on the first try.Furthermore, this product does appear to cause problems with other software which was running prior to the installation of the product.This product is not ""Ready for Primetime."""
2,good book,"Received book almost immediately...enjoyed the contents. So far, this is one of the best books I've read on this subject. I wish i would have read this one first."
2,"A game best played with friends- but oh, so fun...","I played this with a group of friends, and we managed to sit down, completely lose track of time and play until the wee hours. It is absolutely imperative that this game be played with at least one pther player if you want to get past the more diffcult challenges on each level, plus it is a lot of fun to see what your character can do, or your friends' can do, after more time playing, experience, and new skills. While not the best game I have ever played, it is a lot of fun, and I would like to see what would happen if we had four players going at once- it should be VERY entertaining!"
1,Don't say a word? Dont expect much,"Conceptually, this movie is fantastic: To save his kidnapped daughter, a child psychologist must pry a sequence of numbers from the mind of a seemingly psychotic and thoroughly overmedicated and messed up young girl.Notice I said ""conceptually."" Keep reading my review.Based on this premise, what I was expected was tense drama and suspense as Michael Douglas attempts to forge a bond with the girl to unlock the mysteries of her past and convince her to reveal her secrets. What I got was completely unrealistic--the girl's trust solidified in a matter of moments, leading to a completely predictable, formulaic conclusion.Come on. The only time people open up like that is when they're on Jerry Springer. Had I known that this movie was directed by the same director that ruined the book, ""Kiss The Girls"", I may not have rented it at all.Conclusion: If you're curious, rent it. This is not something with a lot of playback appeal."
2,Best book on RMI,"This is the best book on RMI that I have come across and I personally own 4 RMI books (about 10 if you count books that aren't solely on RMI). Contrary to a previous reviewer, this is NOT a beginners book. Beginners should get a more verbose RMI tutorial-like book. This is an advanced reference with very few examples, but it covers topics that you just can't find anywhere else, and furthermore, presents the topics in a detailed, to the point, lucid manner.There is no better RMI book for the advanced RMI developer who is wishing to learn the ""under the hood"" workings of RMI."
1,Keep your eye on the clock!,"While some of the tricks are useful, others just make things more confusing. The game setups took a long time and although they sometimes worked OK, more often than not they really slowed me down. Even worse: I only finished half the logic games section before I ran out of time. I do NOT want this to happen when I take the LSAT.I've found some of the other books take simpler approaches which are far easier to learn. That's where I would spend my money."
2,Good Math Book/Program,"I am a homeschooling mom. We have used other math programs in the past, but this is certainly the best! It is very easy for the teacher (me) and student to understand. I wish we'd used it all along our homeschooling journey."
2,Zune Charger,The zune charger that I ordered works great!!!! The process was easy and it was delivered in a timely matter. Thanks!!!!
1,Bad to the bone,"One major character is blinded, but continues to shoot up the place. I would have better spent my time by closing my eyes and resting up. Watch anything but this waste of time and talent."
2,The Phantom Menace by Thomas Squara,"Star Wars Phantom Menace(1999).127mins Dir.George Lucas ,Starring Ewan Mcgregor, and Liam Neeson . Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader is discovered as a young child with an incredible spirit of a young Jedi Knight emerging.First knowledge of the Sith emerging in the face of Darth Maul. Humerous characters such as Ja Ja Binks ,are introduced to the series.Packed with adventure and action,with amazing computer visual effects. Thomas Squara."
1,Lost in the translation.,This release is a disappointment compared to the spanish language albums. The production tried too hard to sound like a lot of the fabricated teen artists of today. And even though Shakira wrote a lot of the material it is easy to hear that someone held her hand on LAUNDRY SERVICE. It just sounds bland and could be mixed in with a lot of homogenized pop artists.But this is her first English album. Maybe if the sales are high for this one she'll be able to put in her own signiture for the next one. But when you're on TRL you have to mesh in with that sound some how. Let's hope that Shakira doesn't get lost in the soon-to-be teen pop rejects or too late in being a part of the latin craze.
1,Description is wrong,"This is the listed Product Description:Make your work life E-Zier! Quality-built, premium steel unit has a strong steel frame, shelves and dividers with a solid fiberboard back. Interlocking design of the shelves and dividers add extra strength to hold up to the heaviest load. Wide shelf fronts serve as generous label holders. Unit features 72 letter-sized compartments. Each compartment will hold up to 750 sheets.Scroll up and read the specifications published directly above the product description. It says it's made out of wood.Houston, we gotta' problem. (reason why I gave it one star. The actual product, made out of wood and which I bought a month ago, is great.)"
2,I'v read this book 5 times and enjoyed it each time!!!,"I was 14 when I first read this book. Two friends (Welly and Hether) are the outcasts of there school. Welly wants to be a fighter but is too blind and fat. Hether, a girl thrown out of the house by her mother's new husband, wants a real adventure like the ones in story books. These wishes seam impossabole, untill they meet Earl Bedwas a boy with no past. together they must over-come tremounds trials of stranth and courage. this book is full of fast pased Adventure, and good laughs. I recomend this book for all ages. This book has inspierd me to write storys more than any other book. I love it !!!"
2,Santana doesn't get any bettter!,For those of you expecting Santana from the 60's or 70's ... forget it. This is the NEW & NOW Santana at his best! His musical talents never cease to grow & improve & this is a fine example of what he has evolved to.
2,A MUST HAVE,"This is a wonderful, wonderful resource to own. After reading this book if you don't write a novel you have no one to blame but yourself. Author goes step by step through the writing process. The book is full of encouragement. The chapters are easy to read and understand. Most of all this book is extremely PRACTICAL. I recommend it highly."
2,WHAT THE HELL!?,"What am I missing here? This is an incredible album, even without the bonus tracks that make it beyond incredible. I think some SRV ""fans"" resent him making an album that has cross-over appeal. Hell, I would say ""Change It,"" ""Lookin' Out the Window,"" ""Look At Little Sister,"" and ""Say What"" are as good a songs as SRV ever did. But there are a lot more great songs as well. And he does throw a bone to the blues/jazz crowd with the songs ""Gone Home"" and ""Empty Arms."" Of course the two Hendrix bonus tracks will blow you away. I will repeat what someone else has already said, Stevie played Jimi better than Jimi played Jimi. To people getting into SRV, trust me, this is a great album."
1,Broke on 12 th hole,I was making mortises in red oak and the bit broke on the 12th hole. I am not happy with the quality of the bit. Everything else I have that is Delta has has shown itself to be of good quality.
1,Will not unwind,The antenna will not unwind from the reel. I returned this one and will trySangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antennawhich looks very similar to this one.
1,worst Sally Hansen product,"Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat is definitely the worst Hansen product I've tried and may be the worst nail product I've ever used. I am on my third application, shaking the bottle gently and applying -- once on nude clean nails and twice over nail polish. In each instance, the No Chip cracked and flaked in one day. I used polish remover and tried again. I'm finally doing what I haven't done before...I'm taking this stuff back to the store and politely asking for a refund. I think if more ladies do this, instead of feeling ashamed at buying a useless product, we would end up with better products (money talks, girls)!"
1,I Got Conned,"It's a quirky description and an interesting cover...but the book is terrible. The writing is stilted and amateur and reads more like a barebones outline than a finished and published book. I read better fanfiction on the net anyday.The main character is a spineless, boring girl who I just can't feel sorry for. The rest of the characters are also overdrawn stereotypes without any human characteristics. This book occurs like a movie by a film school director trying to be ""different"".Don't bother. I probably won't even finish it. If you want to try, I'll send it to for the cost of postage."
1,Didn't do it for me,"I did finish the book, but wouldn't recommend it. I wanted to like this book, and did enjoy some of the descriptions of the authors interactions with his younger brother, but found much of the book too tedious. I like memoirs and autobiographical books where the author seems to be open and honest, but Eggers book did not ring true for me. Skip this book and read This Boy's Life by Tobias Wolff."
1,Makes my dogs sick,"I thought this product would help my dog with digestion problems. She has a sensitive stomach and has previously benefited from enzymes and probiotics. Instead it made my dog cough and vomit. Even my other dog, who is less sensitive, vomited from this product. I do not know how to get a refund, but I wish I could."
2,Air freshners,"This fragrance is light and lemony. I like it much better than the heavy floral scents of popular air freshners. Although the bottle is small, it lasts a very long time. I have used Fernwood products in the past and they are exceptionally fine."
1,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I don't feel it's up to Adams' usual standard, nor as good as ""sniglets""--remember them? I don't like the idea of using existing words--usually proper nouns. More imagination was needed. And I didn't get the illustrations."
1,"Wait a minute, think of the Daddies!","Hey, wait, you guys! Think of the Daddies. I'm sure the creators of this cover were thinking of all the daddies who get to look at the image of this Anne while their precious little Britneys and Mimseys are reading all about demure and delightful Anne inside the book. Why shouldn't they get a little blonde eye candy?"
1,very small tab,The music in the book is not very appealing and the tab is so small you need binoculars to read it.
2,Joan Crawford In The Wild West,"Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCaimbridge play rival touugh ladies in this western allegory about feminism, the red scare, and mob rule. Crawford shows why she was a major star--her authority is unquestioned. McCaimbride is amazing."
2,Hard to find wiper arms.,I bought these wiper arms and wiper blades for my son's old Mustang II hoping that they would fit. No Problem! It took about 15-20 minuter to install and put on the blades!
2,Great service!,"Great, speedy service. The product was exactly as described. I would buy again from this seller!"
2,The West Wing - Complete Series Collection,I purchased this set for my husband for Christmas. I couldn't have found a more perfect gift if I had searched all year. He is a tremendous fan of the series and was truly thrilled to have ALL of it. We have been watching an episode here and there since Christmas and have enjoyed every minute - both of us.
2,Chilling Reminder,"Though I had read Eric Bentley's compilation of the HUAC hearings (""Thirty Years of Treason""), it was not as chilling as this dramatic reenactment of some of the more intriguing testimony. I wish it were on a CD instead of an audio tape, however."
1,Ruined disc,When I need to relax I do it by watching these old video episodes of the old Hawaii five-0. I recognise the way of living and enjoy looking - and laughing at the stories. Though by not checking every disc to be allright prior to running them I discovered too late that one disc was ruined at the purchase. It is impossible to see any of the episodes of disc six. Make sure this doesnt happen to you.
1,Warning,This product works in with Windows XP ONLY! Do not buy if you have Windows Vista or Window 7!!!!!!! The setup for Windows XP is very particular to SP2. I updated my Windows XP SP2 to SP 3 and the junk software that comes with this thing quit working!! Don't but this thing!!!!!
2,wedding anniversary gift,"Tanzanit colour is a little bit paler than on the picture.Diamonds are shiny,looks good on a hand.Not for everyday wear.I am satisfied.Thank you"
1,a disappointing bore,"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
2,The most used power tool I own,"I have several corded and cordless tools but this one is by far the most used tool in my DIY arsenal. This tool has enough power to drive 1.5 inch drywall screws and is light enough you can use it all day with out fatigue. The quick release action makes it easy to switch between various sizes of cross, flat, square and specialty bits.This tool is just the right speed to do electrical work but not fast enough for some construction work. But I don't need it to be. I have my full size drills for that.This tool is well built. I have dropped or knocked over mine several times with no damage. It even feels better in my hand than some of the less expensive cordless screwdrivers my friends have."
2,Excellent book,The book challenges practically everything I thought I knew about pre-conquest native american culture. A fascinating read covering both the remarkable societies and landscape before 1491 and the crushing tragedy which follows it.
2,WORKS FOR ME,"yeah yeah, Led Zep clones, blah blah blah. If I didn't like it then it wouldn't matter who they cloned. I've heard much worse by newer, 'original sounding' bands. It rocks, my ears like it, end of story.[...]"
2,Supreme Album ( whos Method Man),"Well let me strat off by sayin he is Shaolins Finest. For 3 years he saved the Clan while Meth was playin with Redman. Now to get back on track its a greatest hits album with great ol school Wu classics and new age Ghost. You will enjoy this album with songs like Winter Warz, Cher Chez la Ghost, the great Buck 50, and classic All I Got Is You with Mary J.Yo aint got much to say but get this album cause its worth the money and will satisfy your rap cravings. On a last note 50 you a fool for contestin with the Kings of New York Ghostface Killah and Jigga Man Jay-Z."
1,WORSE THAN AVERAGE,"The plot, assuming some connection between electronic computer communications with the human body was wound up with a ""living"" program with a backdoor. What a convoluted, overly-complicated plot. The characters were pretty much run of the mill cardboard stereotypes the way the author wanted them and this added to the general poorness in the book."
1,Uninteresting,I found the film uninteresting. The animation is what really got me. If the plan was to go ahead with the movie I'd say get graphics like the Watchmen or 300 had or get real people. I couldn't get past the animation even for a beginner it would be better as a free movie than going to screen.
1,The bandwagon trundles onwards.,What on earth is this rubbish? Is this what we've got to look forward to - complete tat with the name of a film tacked onto the box? Bring back the old Lego space sets.
2,bullet open can,I received this trash can a month ago and I am totally delighted with it compared to my old trash can. The bag stays put and doesn't slide down into the can and the open top is very convenient.
1,"File under Trash, not Thrash","Worst Megadeth album. End of story. Don't waste your money. Get the remastered MD.45-The Craving(with Dave on vocals!) instead. I bought Risk when it first came out and I wanted to cry. If this was the direction they were headed, I would see what Metallica was doing at that time then. Luckily, they got over that creative goof and started putting out the slammin' music again. If you are new to the band, here is your mission:Peace Sells, But Who's BuyingRust in PeaceCryptic WritingsThe World Needs a HeroKilling is my Business and Business is GoodBuy these first and listen to them until they are worn out. Then:The System has FailedYouthanasiaCountdown to ExtinctionAnd:So Far, So Good, So WhatThis last one was when they were all pretty blasted on drugs and basically made the record to support the habit. It shows in the music and the new drummer and guitarist are lousy.Avoid Risk at all costs. Even if it's offered to you for free or given to you by Aunt Fanny at Christmas."
2,Delightful stories to complement the Raggedy Ann series.,"Raggedy Ann needed family, and along comes Raggedy Andy, her adorable brother. The books are the perfect accessory to the dolls I made for my sister-brother grandchildren. The stories are wholesome and sweet, just right for younger children. I heartily endorse these charming books."
2,Tour de Force J.L.L.,"[I assume that the title listed above is the 1971 unsold TV pilot released by the Magnum Music Group in 1992]. Most of Lewis' all-performance videos reveal Jerry Lee, the high-powered, quintessential Country rocker. Here we get an unprecedented view of the Ferriday Fireball as boogie woogie master, balladeer, guitarist, philosopher and Gospel harmonist - plus the chance to see Jackie Wilson and Carl Perkins deliver excellent renditions of their hits, in addition to sister Linda Gail Lewis deliver the goods mightily on the incredible duet with big brother on ""When You Wore A Tulip"" (Tiny Tim's & the Three Stooges' versions really don't compare). Seriously, that show opener is a show stopper - it belongs in a Television time-capsule. A perfect performance! There are some ""padded"" spots with lesser known groups and performers, but American Music fans should know about this tape; Jerry Lee Lewis fans must own it."
1,Should've pay extra for Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel,"I got this ""his and her"" mugs thinking it should be as good as Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel. It's heavy and it doesn't hold much beverage. I should've just pay more and get the real deal -- Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel keeps the drink cooler even after a hot day in the car. keep body hydrated is good for health. Just don't put beverage that's too hot. rinse it and keep it dry every night to prevent mold. Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel is like a hidden jewel, wish we know about it sooner."
1,Neither witty nor funny....just silly.,"I loved 'Angela's Ashes' and I wanted to like this book. The four and a half star reviews and the wonderful book cover gave me the impression that this book is witty and charming. Unfortunately, it is neither. I just found it downright silly. Could not get past Chapter 3."
2,Fear the Living,Life is short...do not test Rick. Do not throw zombies at him. You want to see how the Living treat each other in a zombie world...check it out.If not...go watch the English Patient or some boring movie.
2,Worthwhile Read for New Perspectives,"For the price, this is a worthwhile book that presents a different perspective on politics and current events. Just be warned this is not an objective treatment on the science or implementation of propaganda. I was looking for a book that explored how propaganda works and is managed. Instead, the author spends a lot of time criticizing policy and those he considers the power elite. I appreciate the author's point of view but tend to discount criticism that doesn't come with proposed solutions, examples, supporting data and facts."
2,A high quality movie with lots of added stuff,"Movie and sound quality was great, quite frankly with all the added storyboard and interview information added they could have just added T1 and it would've been fine for the price"
2,Best Bedtime story ever!,"Great story! Love the pictures! My three year old absolutely adores this book, and requests it every night before bed."
1,too expensive & short rolls of film make this a bad choice,The printer and these cartridges are for suckers and that's how I feel after printing over 500 cards with this crummy printer. The cartridges rarely give me the 50 printed cards they promise and my last order had one cartridge that gave me fewer than 30 prints before it was ended.There are better bargains for this equipment with a much lower cost per card than this one.
1,Caruso C97953 Salonpro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter With 30 Rollers,It didn't curl my hair as well as my old curlers which was a bummer. Seems for my naturally curly hair I need to blow dry my hair first and then it will curl from the rollers. I like when I can just roll my hair after naturally drying.
2,Exactly Right,"I'm Armenian, and the Ottoman Turks (muslims) murdered 1.5 million Armenian civilians (including members of my family) in 1915, with exactly the mentality that this film explains. For those that want to learn about Islam as it exists in majority muslim countries, this film is for you."
2,Beautiful Flag!,"I put this flag up on my house on Kwanzaa 2012, and posted it's picture on Facebook and all of my friends loved it. It's a great way to show your black pride and help yourself stay grounded!"
1,Zombie-ish,"I was very much looking forward to this release. As big fan starting back with ""Tea for the Tillerman"" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed ""A is for Allah"", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,""An Other Cup"" is unlistenable.Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of ""A is for Allah"" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is."
2,Very good cd....,"Can't believe this CD doesn't have any reviews yet. If you like hardbop jazz, then this cd is one you need to add to your collection. The cd really has a nice flow to it. Three for Amanda, and Grace are two of my favorites. Look forward toward other releases."
2,Really good cabin filter,"What can I say about this product, well, it is a filter and it cleans air in your car."
1,More quasi-Mexican hoo-ha.,"Another yawn-fest of boring pseudo-folk songs from this overrated Tucson band. White people professing their Hispanic influences is about as valid as Vanilla Ice pretending to be down with the 'hood, and using a Mariachi band as back-up musicians is just as offensive as John Courgar Mellencamp utilizing gospel singers to make it seem like he's a funk soul brother. Sorry, Calexico, but you're Gringos and you always will be--no amount of lyrics about migrant workers eating tortillas is ever going to change that. On top of this, the music is so laid-back, so devoid of energy, it's positively coma-inducing. It makes Giant Sand sound like Metallica. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
1,Thousand dollars?,"These would be awesome to get BUT they use to be 40 dollars and now I see they have them listed at 999.99? That is just insane, who do these people think they are? I really wanted a pair but I would have to be legally insane to pay a thousand dollars for them, this should be illegal."
2,AYURVEDIC KING,"This book is a must have if your're studying Ayurveda Medicine. It is easy to read and comprehend, thereby giving you more insight into the world of ayurvedic treatments and principles."
2,Mighty tasty! Great straight-ahead stuff!,"If you love blues piano and want to hear Chicago-style played well, with finesse, check this out. Nice interpretations, with a unique and gentlemanly spin. If you've listened to ""Monsters from the Deep"" by Ned Sublette and Lawrence Weiner, you've caught some of Junior's chops. On the final track of the CD, you get to hear genuinely interesting historical data: who Junior is, who he's worked with, how he thinks. He says ""I'll listen to everybody"". Now that's good advice."
2,wow!,I thought my old vacuum did a great job--I just couldn't stand replacing the messy bag. I used this vacuum for my weekly cleaning. The canister needed emptying before I even reached the bedrooms. It was easy to put together and easy to empty. I am very pleased.
1,What happened to character development and believable plots?,"I must say, when I first saw that my church library had picked up a new Janette Oke book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, by the end of the book, I was just glad that I had gotten it from the library and hadn't laid down good money for this dreadful piece of under developed, boring waste of paper!! Not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Janette Oke. All I can ask is...how can writers who ""scribble off"" (to use another reviewer's well put description) fluff like this actually sell books? I'd like to warn you against buying this book, and if you still want to read it, get it from the library!"
2,Fun,This car is very fast and durable. It goes 20 mph. I crashed it at top speed and it still runs perfect. It runs 30 minutes on acharged battery pack but it takes 4 hours to charge. But this is a great car
1,"not useful for ""coders""","The book has useful information but it is ""user"" unfriendly from a ""medical coders"" point of view. It does not address the whole: ""prefix or suffix"" issues and is hard to use"
1,Very bad!,"The one I got has a short in the input jack and I have to bend the cord under the pedal, but it works and I love the foot pedal!"
1,Nothing Righteous,"Usually when a new album comes out from a favorite artist, you're excited. Finally five years after ""Relish"" out comes ""Righteous Love"" It surprised me initially how low key this release was. Why didn't they play anything from it on the radio, after how well ""One of us"" did on the charts. I quickly realized why after popping ""Rightous Love"" into my stereo. The first few tracks are okay, with a different sound from her previous album. Unfortunately the album goes down from there. The edgy, bluesy sound I liked so much on ""Relish"" and her ""Early Recordings"" is gone, whether filtered out or just a change in her singing, I don't know, but the result is disappointing and so so singing at best. She butchers through Dylan's love ballad ""To Make you Feel My Love"", which is probably the most unforgiveable part of this album. Its a shame but ""Righteous Love"" suffers the second album curse, DOA."
2,Fabulous!,Fabulous kids show! Love the lesson learned! Loved the crafts. Very user friendly format! Very funny! Are there more to come?!?!
1,Avoid this LeapFrog,"I usually love Leap Frog - but beware...Our register may have been a ""lemon"" but it just didn't work...The coins kept getting stuck and we would have to shake them to get them loose...This happened constantly...It really frustrated my children...There is nowhere to store the ""swipe"" cards, so they easily get lost...Although my children seemed to enjoy the toy, getting it to work and having the accessories easily attached would have made this toy a winner...Taking the time to improve this toy prior to making it available to the public should have been a priority for this otherwise reliable company..."
1,Do touch this product!,"I spent over two weeks trying to get this software to work and every error including the 'blue screen of death' was a known problem by Symantec. Their solution was uninstall, reinstall over and over. Each time new errors and again all known by Symantec.This product is not ready for release and unless you want to Beta test for Symantec, don't go near it.No stars for this product."
1,Car charger broke,The car charger strated to catch fire the very fist time i plugged it in. I just pulled it off quickly but it was already burned. I still using the rest of the kit.
1,Poor Software Quality,"Kaplan TOEFL CBT tests are really buggy and scores are not accurately calculated:1. The program does not recognize correct answers where more than one answer has to be chosen.2. The program does not retain the essay.2. When shifting from the general test feedback section to a specific section analysis (reading, listening or structure) and back again to the general feedback section, all the scores for the test change. You have to go back to the Main Menu to retrive the original scores for the test.3. When re-taking the same test for a second time, the whole program locked and I could not verify my answers."
1,It is not for Olympus C3030,"I do not understand why this bag is on the C3030's list of accessories. It's to small for C3030. I bought it, hardly could squash the camera, than forgot to send it back. Just a warning for others ....."
2,I love it!,"This is fun to use, and highly effective (much more so than those ab lounges) it's impossible to have improper form with this bench, and it folds down for storage quickly and easily.I definitely recomend this."
2,UN LIBRO PARA TODA LA VIDA,"Este libro te establece y refuerza los hábitos con los que podemos apreder a ser felices, aún pasaNdo tribulaciones y experiencias te puedes mantener feliz para toda la VIDA"
2,I loved my Reebok Fitwatch until it stopped working...,"My Reebok Fitwatch was a great product for about 9 months until the screen stopped working properly and now it only displays gibberish. However, for 50 dollars, I think 9 months was still a good value. The watch is better for running than for biking because on a bike, it can be difficult to continue riding while pressing down the two buttons with one hand. I usually had to stop to take my heart rate while biking, but for running, it's perfect."
1,Stilted narrow-minded view of complex issues,"A simplistic light-weight, boring, stilted. Pseudo-intellectualism at its best. This one is going to wind up in the Dollar Store bin."
1,Don't buy this product.,This was a waste of money. It leaked sugar water all over the deck and I couldn't even use it. I saw some of the reviews saying it leaked but I wanted to give it a try because I liked the balloon. I should have trusted the reviews. Don't buy this with plans of using it as a humming bird feeder - it leaks like crazy. I'm trying to find a way I can use this as a garden decoration. Very disappointing! Wish I could give it less than one star.
2,Love it,"I wish this movie came in single DVD but, alas, it is only available in multiple movie set and I shy away from those. The VHS tape played very well and was great fun. It has been many years since I saw this movie and had forgotten just how good it is. Of course, it's definitely B&W 40s type Hollywoodized stuff but I really enjoyed seeing it again. I've looked at it several times and continue to enjoy the tender love story between these very different people. I don't think I've ever seen Marlena Dietrich in any other movie but I've ordered a set of several others since I liked her in this so much. I guess I always thought she was all accent and smouldering eyes but she was a very good actress and I look forward to seeing the other movies. Weeks later: I see now that Golden Earrings can be purchased in the single DVD and I've ordered it. For all you hopeless romantics who love old movies, don't miss this one. It's one of my absolute favorites."
2,I love these old cartoons,I remember watching these cartoons when I was a kid. They are actually still fun to watch although very predictable. Good memories.
1,don't forget your machete.,"While the book is a very informative one, Keegan is apparently talented in the art of digression. He spends the fist sixty-four pages of his literary labor extolling the virtues of America and its inhabitants, and describing (to what end, I cannot tell) his innumerable vacations, trips, and adventures in and about North America. He also (for reasons similarly ambiguous) chooses to include in this preface, a roundabout, labyrinthine discourse on his personal thoughts and experiences to do with England and France in addition to his lengthy (but vaguely on topic) treatise on America. These commentaries are, unlike the rest of the book, absolutely unreadable, forgettable, and just bad. One must plod through them, all the time conscious of mounting apathy and distaste. Their relevance is very near nihility and their pith very near brimful."
1,Vic Firth 'Pump & Grind' Salt Mill much to be desired,"Vic Firth STS06SM01 ""Pump & Grind"" Salt Mill, Stainless SteelIn reading the description of this salt mill, I selected it because it promised to be simple to operate and would also allow me to vary the coarseness of the grind. In fact, the mill is difficult to operate for anything but the smaller crystals, and there were no instructions included as to how to vary the coarseness, and nothing intuitive about the mill to allow one to figure it out without instructions. It certainly looks nice, and takes up little space, but that's about the only positive things I can say about it."
2,A short but terrific 3rd season,"Cut short by the writers strike, still season 3 rumbles along on all cylinders like it's trade mark '67 Chev Impala. New characters -- Ruby, Bela and Lilith -- are introduced to good affect. There are some nice touches : ""A Very Supernatural Christmas"", a sense of urgency as Dean's year is racing toward a rendevouz with Hell and an episode that has the charm of ""Groundhog Day"". The wit is still there. A town is inflected by demons and the boys have been locked in jail by their FBI nemesis. Under the possession of a demon he shoots the town sheriff dead. After being released he gasped, ""I shot the sheriff!"" To which Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackless) replies, ""But you didn't shoot the deputy."""
2,Not Just a Rant,Lundberg is one of the great contrarians of the last century. He is generally outraged and only sometimes outrageous.This book is an impassioned and intelligent look at what the Constitution can and can't do. This isn't just an opinion piece. Lundberg is firmly grounded in looking at history to understand the dynamics of American power. Quite an accomplishment.
2,Exciting mystery,This was exciting suspense filled as always from start to finish.A typical Clive Cussler mystery.I have always enjoyed Cussler stories because of the many different tales of the ancient seafarer and under water discoveries.These are things you never hear about without doing a lot of research and who has the time.
1,Don't do it.,"I am giving this bike 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow anything less. If you are thinking about buying this bike, you would be better off going to a bike shop and spending 50 dollars more. The bike shops 250 dollar bike will be lighter weight, have better parts, and most of all will be more reliable. In the long run you will save money too. I guarantee that you will spend more on repairs of this bike than the initial cost at purchase. And, if you take a look at any of the other bikes on this site, well then remember this review; as it is true across the board."
2,The best I ever had,"I have owned the Caruso roller system for over 25 years. I bought the first set they had with the salt. Yes, I was shocked once by the old ones one time. Not a pleasant feeling. I purchased the saltless system about 10 years ago. It's nice not having to add the salt. I have used these on every kind of hair. In fact I just used them on my niece who has the worst hair. She's 12 and was so embarrassed by her hair she kept it in a bun on top of her head. Well, I used my rollers to style her hair for my sisters wedding and she begged me for my roller set. Her hair never looked better. Everyone that saw her wanted to know how she ""fixed"" her hair. Needless to say I just ordered her a set of her own. I've now bought 5 sets. I'll be a user for life."
1,Horrible,I bought this pedometer with great expectation because i wanted to know the distance and the calories burnt while walking. It arrived pretty soon so i was glad. But it never worked properly. After one hour walking it marked 24 steps and 9 calories burnt! Whaaaat? I followed all the instructions on how to set it up and looked for possible mistakes but i did everything ok and still not working correctly. Finally i attached to my shoe and it gave better numbers but different each day even though i was walking same path and same amount of time. Changed the battery but problem persistedI. Finally i gave up and threw it in the wastebasket. Only thing i like was the clip because it attached strongly and never fell or broke. A total waste of money. Will not recommend.
1,Small capacity--needs service in less than 1 yr.,"I bought this dishwasher with the idea of being able to use just the top drawer for most days, when it is just my husband and me. And that is the one good thing about it, and I think it does clean better because there is only one rack for each spray arm. Large dinner plates don't fit in either drawer. Tall glasses don't fit anywhere, same with deep cereal or salad bowls, unless you can get away with only putting 3 in there. The silverware basket came apart when I was carrying it to the drawer to put away, and clean flatware went all over the floor. My husband epoxyed the thing together so it wouldn't happen again. There is no sani- cycle, which I think would be a real asset, with grandchildren / pets in the household. Today it started flashing an error message, that translates into ""the flood switch has been activated, call service center"" Great! it is not even filled with water, and both dishwashers are in failure mode..."
2,Enough specifics to make price worthwhile,"Couldn't get it at the library, so took a chance and bought it. I've been in business a while and just wanted supplement existing knowledge. There are some REALLY bad books in this category- I think its worth about $30. I would refer back to it."
2,Great cookbook!,Great cookbook one of my favorites have made many reciepes from this book. This was a gift for my daughter
1,It didn't fit!,"The wrench didn't fit the buffer/sander, even though the part number cross-referenced with the Makita website! I'd like to return it for a full refund."
2,Best info,Really enjoying the info loaded inthis book. I love hoe it adjusts the training to the disability. I highly recommend it!
2,The album just keeps getting better...,"Rarely have I picked up an album with such high anticipation (Rolling Stone gave this 5 stars) and actually ended up agreeing. First listen didn't blow me away. Second listen and I started to pick up a bit of a Beatles vibe. By the fourth listen (all in the same day - headphones at work) I realized that his album features some diverse lyrics and musicianship. It didn't sound like anything already out there - the cookie cutter does not apply to Jack White - and the album provided changes in speed, sound that make it a great album. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars (as petty as it sounds), is that although the last song is tongue in cheek, they should have omitted it. Which means I had to skip a song...so it can't be perfect, but a tremendous album nontheless."
1,Ink Hog!!!,"This printer works reasonably well. However, the constant need to replenish these tiny ink cartridges is leading me to seriously consider dumping the printer, about a year after I bought it. I can't give you an exact metric like so many ounces per print or whatever, but, take my word for it, you will be replacing cartridges on this thing every couple of weeks if you do any small amount of printing at all. It is incredibly frustrating.Update 5/2009 -- the ink situation on this thing is just absurd. If you have any substantial sized project (like a few drafts of a 20 page document), be prepared to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges halfway through whatever you are doing. This thing is just useless if you want to use it for light business purposes once in a while. Do not buy this as your ""home office"" printer. I am going to replace it with a laser."
2,Stroke of midnight,great story. The auhur is an excellent story teller. She forgets nothing. Everyone has their own personality. You cannot put down this book.
1,Used to be a big fan,"I've read all of Harlan Corben's books and thought they were witty, imaginative and a great read. My husband & I picked up the unabridged audio CD version for a long drive this week. It was so awful we stopped listing to it and tried the AM stations. Very disappointing. The plot wasn't bad but the dialog was awful and rehashed the same thing from 2 or 3 perspectives. It was like he added about 200 pages of superfilous dialog to make up the word count."
2,book,"great book! My mom bought it for me when I found out I had cancer. It was very healing and also empowering. I have gotten this book for several people since, even doctors. Anyone can get something worthwhile out of it."
1,Leaving Las Vegas (Movie),"The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points. The wrong movie was delivered. I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas. And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas. So that was bad."
2,insane music for insane high on acid,CRAZED WARPED AND BIZZARE. THE GANDFATHER OF PUNKS BEST ALBUM EVER
1,satisfy my rhatid!,"Channer has again wasted my time with another of his over-written, over-eroticized sorry excuses of fiction. He falls into that same bad habit (which he did in his first book 'Waiting in Vain) of name-dropping. It's as if the author is trying to prove to you how much he's read and how good he is -- and any intelligent reader should reel back at his failed cleverness and say ""No, Mr. Channer! No you aren't that good."" Not yet at least."
2,Devon is great!,"My favorite songs on this album are ""Rain Song"" ""Montreal Waltz"" and ""Generic Love Song"". All of which I think show her vocal talents and songwriting ability. I can never get these songs out my head they're so good. I met Devon Sproule and she is a wonderful woman with a gorgeous voice.I adore this album."
2,Wonderful tale of the gift of purity,Beautiful book (in picures and story). It really shows girls (and boys) what a wonderful gift God gives us and how we should save that gift for the special person. Wonderfully told. My daughter (2 1/2) LOVES it. It is her favorite book.
2,A Balanced Treatment,"The Tinnitus Handbook provides a very readable overview of the topic and some of the possible explanations and remedies. I especially liked the objective presentation of alternative medical treatments. The book could be improved by color illustrations of the middle and inner ear to make the physiological descriptions clearer. But, I suppose, that would have meant an increase in price. I highly recommend the book to those suffer from tinnitus and to those who live with those who suffer."
2,Great Upgrade Kit for Less,These guys are great .... best place to get ram upgrades. This is the third time I have used them for upgrades.Their software will check your system and tell you what you have and what upgrades are possible.Hasn't failed me yet and the prices are sweet!
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the first one a great deal, and lined up on opening night to see the second. It was...boring. Yes, there were some cool action sequences, but even those managed to go on too long, and the rest of it...talk, talk, talk, dance, dance, dance...yawn. This was a movie badly in need of an editor. Actually, it felt like half a movie trying to be a whole movie via lots of padding. Maybe if they'd tried to make Reloaded and Revolutions as one movie this one wouldn't have felt so...empty. Don't waste your money."
1,STILL OVERPRODUCED BUT NOT HALF BAD,"Best Song: Moving OletaWorst SOng: SecretBiggest Let Down: I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels. (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!)Other Good Songs: If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely;Forgettable: Love Revival; Somebody;O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune.The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare. But the material here isn't half bad. ""Moving Oleta"" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for ""Song of the Year"". By far one of Reba's most moving performances!"
1,Very disappointed,"This review is specific to the Bigelow Chinese Oolong TeaAfter drinking this tea several times from whole leaves, I admit I made a mistake in purchasing it as tea bags...even if the product comes in individual packed tea bags and under the Bigelow brand. The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening. The tea bags are nothing like it. It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this. Get it as whole leaves.I will continue drinking this (120 bags @ $16) but I won't enjoy it but winter is coming, I'll have reason to drink tea...or find someone who likes this and give it to them."
1,Worked great...for 6 months,"Easy set up. Inexpensive and worked right out of the box...for 6 months. Today, unexplainably lost power and does not work. Beware."
2,Another quality Zyliss product,"Zyliss makes quality products; I've learned to trust the brand name. This garlic press has proved to be indispensable. It's easy to clean and easy to use. You don't have to peel the garlic, and every bit of the garlic gets used. I've owned it for four years now and I expect that it will last for many years to come. This is an item I use almost daily in my kitchen. It's durable and built to last. Well worth the investment. I would buy any product with the Zyliss name."
1,"I kinnot hold'er cap'n, she's breakin' up...","This wasn't even a LKH novel, at least that is what I'm telling myself in order to be up for future books. It had little story line, what it did have was incoherent and very un-LKH like. One sexual travesty to the next and then in the last few pages the quick ""Last five minutes of Star Trek"" wrap up. This book contains brief mentions of the furry... the upcoming new ""big-bad"" and then it ends with a bit of an ""eh"". This book could have been so much more, should have been so much more. This would have been the ultimate Edward book, but he was emasculated in Obsidian Butterfly.I hate to say it, but I'm losing my faith. I miss the old Anita.Guess I'll have to go back and read the earlier books in the series for my ""fix"".Bitterly Disappointed"
2,Great can opener,"Both the service and product are 5 stars! The ease of ordering, delivery, and product quality make me wonder why I ever hop into my car to drive to a store to buy things."
2,Put the same old stuff away and pick up something fresh!,You am I is a band made up of 3 ordinary Aussie blokes who know how to make addictive music. Hourly Daily has everything from accoustic ballads to driving guitars. The lyrics are fun with some typical Aussie sarcasm. I recommend you add this to your music collection - you will not regret it.
2,I love this book!,I love this book because it is so helpful! It has given me peace during a time that brings up bad memories.
1,very bad read,I have enjoyed Gregory's novels of the Tudor era & expected this to be the same. How disappointing! It's like medieval porn. I could not even finish it. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I'd like to removed from my Kindle as I don't even want to own it.
1,"Beautifully written, without a plot","After waiting 10 years for Donna Tartt to write another book, I alternate between being sorely disappointed in this, and vastly impressed by her beautiful prose. Though the writing is splendid, the imagery vivid, and the characters are sublimely developed, the plot plods along at an interminably slow pace, and the ending is atrocious. By the 555th page, the reader would appreciate having an ending, but Tartt refuses, merely ending the book wherever she saw fit, with absolutely no point whatsoever. This doesn't hold a candle to her debut novel, ""The Secret History."""
1,Disappointed,"I was not at all happy with this ring when it arrived. It did not look at all like the picture, but flatter and rougher around the edges. Please note that the braiding does not go all the way around. This is clear in the picture, but I did not notice before I ordered it. Also, the sizing was a bit on the small side."
1,Great if you don't want to see behind you.,This shade blocks almost all visibility out the back window. The suction cups don't stay up very well either.
1,Not as good as truvia,"Taste was rather chemical - this product isn't in the same class as truvia. Cheap price shows through, I can tolerate it with more spices but wouldn't buy it again."
2,"Our own origins, seen through the keyhole of the Declaration","I love the sheer surprise this books brings. It holds a mirror up to US, the contemporaries, madly trying to make myths and theme parks of our own heritage. Maier starts off by touring us right past the physical document of the Declaration, holy of holies, on display like an icon guarded by witch-priests in uniforms. She has no sympathy for this attitude of reverence; in fact, you feel that she might have a good belly laugh over the whole enshrinement, if she weren't feeling so disgusted by it.What's truly interesting is the tour this author takes us on of just where the Declaration came from. Tracing similar words and phrases and whole passages to state and local declarations of the time, she shows us the whole climate of belief the famous framers of the Declaration were working in. This book is really fascinating, I think: a great and surprising portrait of who we really were.And of what we have become"
1,A waste of time,"I found this book really wordy and boring, it put me to sleep. The whole idea of learning AIS from a textbook is just like trying to learn to use computer without a computer! The whole AIS operation circle isn't hard to comprehend, but learning it from hundred of pages of literature is a dumb idea. On top of that, I don't think I have to learn the definition of E-Business and its difference from Internet(is there a e-business operated without internet?!)."
1,Works good for a couple of months,I've tried to use this same gauge 3 times. All 3 resulted in an item which broke. It suffers from direct sunlight. And therefore becomes very fragile and yellowed. One unit had the base you stick in the ground fall off. Overall I give up on this. I should have bought a better unit in the first place.
2,Deathly Hallows part 2,Saw this at the cinema and at home after purchasing the dvd. 3D at the cinema didn't enhance the film at all and I enjoyed it more without having to wear an etra pair of glasses to see limited 3D effects. If you forget the books and just take the film as the final sequel it rounds everything out fairly well. Voldemort was played very well and is the reason to watch this finale for the main part but is disappointing when he turns whimp at the end. Overall I enjoyed the film.
2,"Blue dreams, black despair, red hot!","Listen carefully. That roar of approval you hear will echo around the world, anywhere that books are sold and badges are worn. Gallo's book will be hearalded as fanfare for the common cop. If you want to shatter the television myths of cop life read this book!!"
1,Good for a time,I've had this cord for about 2 1/2 years now and up until this time it worked great. The the cord rolls in and out smoothly but just recently it stopped working properly and it will only play from one side of the car.I would have liked for the product to have a greater longevity than 2.5 years... most people own a car and ipod for much longer.
1,This won Grammy awards?!,"I was lured into downloading this album by hearing the song Don't Know Why on the radio. Honestly, after track two, I couldn't find any more songs that even compare to Don't Know Why! And yes, I listened to the whole album! Now, why did this win so many grammys?! Was it the pretty face on the cover? Was it the fact that she plays piano? This album reminds me of music played in the ocean liner ballroom during the opening scene of ""Ghostship""! Just watch that movie and you'll know what I'm talking about! I definitely agree with the reviews that say this is great for insomniacs!"
1,Better than no paprika at all!,"The product is ok, but the packaging is not. The plastic lids had come off of two of the packages and spilled the product inside the box. There was rust inside of the tins. I believe that another reviewer had the same problem. I found a much better supplier on the Internet--in Vermont, of all places!"
1,no hope,"i bought this book to get understanding and to try and figure out why wicca is growing and spreding faster than Christianity in our area. i still do not know why. after reading the book i saw how unorganized and everything the religion is. it offers no hope to those who believe and certainly there is no ""power to be obtained""... i found the book not only uninteresting, but probably the most misleading of any i have read so far."
2,Should come in handy,This guild would be excellent if it had better and more illustrations. The descriptions and location info seems really good. I have ordered the “Sibley” guide for western birds to fill in the missing color illustrations.
2,Great information about a confusing time:,I bought this book for my son. I have read the entire thing cover to cover and have decided that he is only ready for some of the material at this point. He will be allowed to read the whole thing in a year or two. This book gives great info on health and hygiene as well as changes in the body during puberty. There are comments about becoming sexually active that I am not comfortable with at this point but I think that may just be because I don't think my son is old enough for the details.I do recommend this book but encourage parents to read it and decide for themselves if their son(s) should read the whole thing or not.
1,eTrex is not a trail model,"Very disappointing unit and I returned it immediately to purchase a a Garmin GPSMAP 60. The eTrex would not acquire *any* satellites in a wooded area in winter, no foliage. Seemed fine otherwise, but I don't think it should be marketed as a trail model. The GPSMAP 60 is super though, great sattellite acquisition and features, but costs a good bit more."
1,A book with no clear examples. It's a big mess,I'm using this book as a textbook for my Electronic class. This book is useless because it seems like both were writing this book for him self. It's full and i mean full of equations. They forgot to mention what is meaning of thier equations. This new approch need to be written by some one have the students in mind.
2,Fantastic Case,"I was having a hard time looking for am inexpensive case for my ipod nano 2nd gen. I don't like the silicon skins nor the hard cases. I saw this case and decided to go with the brown version. It actually looks surprisingly good with my black nano. The interchangeable fronts (one comes with a belt clip and the other is just flat) work very well. The bottom of the front cover is attached by a metal button (much like on a jacket) that is pretty sturdy and the top is held closed by a magnet. The magnet holds it tight and I do not have any problems with it coming open while clipped to my pocket or messenger bag strap. I run with the nike+iPod kit, so I am constantly pulling the nano out of this case and putting it in an armband. The case has held up to the wear and should last a lot longer.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this case (or a color variant) to anyone who is interested in a nice, cheap case with interchangeable covers."
1,UFC Classics Vol. 1,A lot more talking and other filler thanactual fighting action. This would makea great thirty minute video if edited downto the actual action.
2,Blondie's lost star but still as sweet,"Blondie's 7th studio album No Exit don't reach the 5 stars which I would rate to the former Blondie albums. Screaming Skin, Maria, Under the gun, No Exit, Double take and Out in the streets are real Blondie classics: strong as ever. But that leaves 8 tracks on the album which don't have the catchy power/punk pop to which Blondie is famous for except maybe Nothing is real but the girl (the second single of this album).Nevertheless Blondie proved with this album that even in the ninety's they are able to release a good record.Maria and Screaming skin are the killers of the album."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! REAL REVIEW,we had 1 or 2 rats the beginning of winter now thanks to this product we have a whole family of rats... this thing attracted the rats to my attic.. complete waste or money... NOW IM FORCE to do the $2 rat traps with springs I wanted to be nice but at this point there not letting me go to sleep... AGAIN I DONT CARE WHAT ANY OTHER REVIEW SAYS THIS CRAP DONT WORK!
2,Intense Pop,"I have a vinyl copy of this record which sounds gutsier, but has a mark on a couple of tracks. This is a great pop record. As good as Oasis but with more harmony. I can just imagine the Britain they are singing about.An intense but melodic record."
2,Quite an Original!,"This was a no nonsense, get the job done sort of story. It was practical, yet still unbelievably moving. A tear jerker for certain. Highly recommend!"
1,Too thin,Ugh! I took a chance despite some negative reviews. It's OK. It is definitely thicker than regular paper but I've bought nicer cardstock at big box store. Won't buy this brand again.
2,Wonderful!,"This product works amazing! I ended up buying another one for my mom. The ocean and the rain are my favorites. I hate the night sounds (I live in Alaska, hearing crickets is just a strange and annoying NOISE) The rain had a clicking noise every now and again but after using it for a bit when we tried the rain again the noise was gone so it must have been from sitting. My mom's used it so much already I don't know how it's worn out. There are no problems other customers had. Though I imagine with enough constant use I will have problems with it (as expected from everything from cell phones to bedding, nothing lasts forever) Don't let the complainers scare you away because that's all their reviews are- complaints because things don't last forever. :) I think everyone should buy one or two!"
1,"Un buen libro para que el que no conoce nada de pitufos, continúe sin conocer nada de Pitufos.","Este libro incluye inmensas fotografias de muñecos de pvc, sin un orden particular, simplemente como muestra y con la oculta intencion de ocupar espacio. El estado de estos es bastante pobre. Es mas...Pitufina con raqueta de tenis, que es un muñeco de lo mas facil de conseguir...no tiene raqueta!!!El resto son sets generalmente a medio completar.Creo que es una lastima producir un libro asi, que podria haber sido un poco mejor si hubiese sido realizado por alguien mas entendido en el tema."
2,Lost Books of Bible Review,"Lost Books are VERY good scripture that was taught to Christians in the first century A.D.. A particularly great text is in Bartholomew where abortion is directly addressed and is CLEARLY forbidden, something you cannot find in traditional, canonized scripture."
1,Rather be fishing,"Take a nap before you watch it or else you'll fall asleep like me. I like a good goofball horror flick as much as the next guy, but this one is just a wannabe. It had potential with the comic book scene transfers and musical undertones - both elements which i liked and thought were quite creative - however, i just couldnt get past the horribly annoying and retarded characters, like the deputy - uggg! That first gore scene where dude's eating the pie in the kitchen did manage to squeeze a giggle or 2 out of me, though. So there are a few laughs and some decent effects, but for the most part the attempted slapstick is just too corny for my tastes. And not that it always matters in the horror genre, but the dialogue and script were just awful and contrived too. I give it a couple stars for the gore but I might suggest you rent this one before purchasing. Who knows, it might grow on me like Cabin Fever did. Word up"
2,The best book I ever read,I laughed all the way through this book. I can wait until his Comdey Central show comes out.
1,Poor design,"I bought this camera recently and added also bought a padded carrying case for it. During a football game, I returned it to its case, latched the cover, and set it on the seat beside me. I stood up, and brushed it off the bench; it fell approximately 18 inches - in a padded case. This short and padded fall broke the camera! Kodak refuses to repair what appears to me to be a very fragile product. If you buy this product, treat it like an fresh egg (or a rotten egg as far as I am concerned. So much for buying American.)"
2,Great case!,"Well made bag, fits more than it look like it is able to. It is well made and a nice quality. No one can touch this price."
2,Soap Opera with lovely accoutrements,"Yes, it is a soap opera with lovely costumes & locale. Very good acting & correct historical perspective. The story line of the upper crusts & the servants is a wonderful political statement. Enjoy!"
2,Appreciative Inquiry,"I love these ""thin books"" and glad to know there are other people like me who believe you can get your point across in less than 200 pages! This little book has BIG ideas and concepts. I received the book three days after placing my order. Great resource. I will read Appreciative Inquiry regularly."
1,Cornwell Definitely At Risk,"First and foremost, I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK. And I'll not read it based on the reviews posted here and my reading of her last Scarpetta debacle, ""Predator."" I do believe Cornwell has lost her touch. Case in point, her last two Scarpetta offerings, while fairly well-written and suspenseful through the majority of the books, the endings were simply anti-climatic and bordering on farcical. I think it time that Ms. Cornwell take a break, read reviews such as these & take them to heart, and go back to her literary roots that made her an outstanding author. I only hope she can do so as for now, she's been removed from my 'must read' list."
2,Little League - too much pressure on the Kids,"This is an excellent book on the inner happenings of Little League Baseball. I really enjoyed the candid assesments of how parents and managers go overboard. The book though is not a bashing of the little league faults - it gives inside looks at what happens at williamsport and the teams...I really enjoyed the stories about the ugly rivalry between California and Florida and how Dante Bichette Sr. got out of control - also the stories about Curacao and Japan and how serious they take the game - the stories about the pitcher's not resting their arms and getting major injuries is a wake up...Finally, the story centers on Hawaii and how they built their team swithcing from Pony to Little League - and how they practiced so hard - 6 days a week! Great stories about Little league baseball and how Travel teams are so much better and talented (cooperstown baseball)...if you enjoy youth baseball - you'll love this book"
1,Paranoid world view,"I first read this book back when it first came out, in the early 1990's I think it was. At the time I found to be a very poorly written and very clumsy novel. I have read some of the author's other works and find his paranoid world view to be more than I can take. I recently tried re-reading this particular book again and find it even harder to read than my first attempt. It is not something I would recommend to any one."
1,Where's the integrity?,"The NYT digital subscription is like the old roach motel - you can get in but you can't get out.First problem they hit your credit card every 28 days instead of once a month. Sneaky. After a while you have no idea when is the end of the billing cycle (which is when you want to cancel).Second, to cancel you have to call, on a telephone. WHY IS THAT??? Believe me, the wait is long, looong. When (if) they finally answer, the struggle begins.Third, the reps are such liars. Mine said, ""Sir, you are cutting out, I am going to have to hang up..."" and she did. I was calling on a land line! It was infuriating. What am I to think of that company's reporting truth if they have such little regard for it while talking to a person?The 99 record clubs of my teenage years had more integrity than the NYT!"
2,Value,"Received the item in a very timely manner, plus the value cannot be touched by any local store here in central Missouri. Would shop there again."
2,Excellent Source to Bond with your Children!,"Dr. Cohen did a fabulous job writing this important manual for parents/guardians to use with their children. As an avid student of child development, play is how our children can best articulate their feelings and need to others. It is our job as caregivers, educators, and skilled professionals to acknowledge what children are trying to say when words can limit or misinterpret their means of communication. Play can help us understand our kids as well; help encourage them to express themselves in a safe and non-critical environment. I highly recommend this publishing for caregivers, students, educators, and practitioners, alike."
1,Tries to be 2 types of shower but not good at either,"This shower head can function either as a rain shower where it uses all the jets, or as a more traditional shower where it only uses the nozzles in the middle of the shower head.The problem is it isn't good at either.In rain shower mode, you notice the rain pattern isn't very even. Its stronger in the middle, and very soft towards the edges. It feels weak and disappointing even for a rain shower.In the traditional mode, there are insufficient nozzles for it to compete with a single function head like a Kohler Katalyst model. Further it's not that powerful even without the flow limiter.Final issue is the build quality is really poor. It's all plastic and feels really cheap. Can't imagine this lasting."
1,Worse than I Expected.,"The most offensive movie I've seen in a long time--a film about a couple vapid, unsympathetic people surrounded by pathetic caricatures of vapid and unsympathetic people. Maybe the movie was one big ironic joke...but it doesn't read that way. I consider liking this movie a character flaw."
1,Ramona lacks excitement,"I used this book as a read aloud in my 3rd grade classroom, and to put it bluntly, my students found it to be boring. A lot of the language seemed ""dated."" During Cleary's attempts at humor, I found my students staring at me with ""I don't get it"" looks on their faces. I have found the whole Ramona series to be a little disappointing. A better choice for 3rd graders is the Fudge series by Judy Blume.To put it bluntly, my 3rd graders found this book to be boring. I used this book as a read aloud in my classroom."
1,Al Franken is satan,"This is just another piece of garbage from the Democratic Bush-haters. Nothing in this book is real -- it's all lies, made up by folks who think, as the Nazis did, that if you tell lies long enough, some fool will believe it. Why anyone would publish such garbage, much less sell it to the public, is beyond me -- they must lack all character in doing so. If there were honest lawyers out there, these authors would be sued for the libel they have foisted on us. Dont' bother buying this trash!Al Franken must have been severely beaten by his parents as a child to have turned into such a miscreant adult. Someone commit him before he hurts himself."
2,Excellent Material for both Kids and Adults,"I have read the first book in the Harry Potter series, the Sorcerer's Stone, and found it to be very entertaining and interesting. Before I have picked up the Sorcerer's Stone book, I have not read a novel for over twenty years. I believe that the other books in the Harry Potter series will be just as good as the first book. The Harry Potter series is highly recommended for adult reading."
1,Another Dissappointment,"I was very dissappointed after completing Pimsluer's ""Quick and Simple Egyptian Arabic."" The set includes 4 compact disks with 8 30-minute lessons. However, about 10 minutes of each lesson is a review of the previous lesson with a couple of new words introduced. Review is always good, and it's the only way to learn a language, but couldn't one just rewind the tape? I feel like I only learned about 10 words. In truth, I probably learned about 60, so that works out to about 33 cents per word since I paid $20.00 for it. The disks don't teach anything about grammar, tenses, and writing, of course. I don't even feel like I've sratched the surface of the language. Perhaps I should have purchased the Egyptian Arabic I audio, but it is extremely expensive. In short, if you are looking to learn Arabic, I'm sure you could find something less expensive and more worth your time."
1,Dated and disturbing,"Emotional abuse, Racism, Emotional incest, Religious bigotism and just plain cruelty. NOT a book I enjoyed reading and I would certainly not give it to a child to read."
2,Good product!,I was very pleased with this product. It was a VERY good price compared to the same product from other vendors. It was described perfectly. I received exactly what I wanted!
1,Pretty weak tribute,"Far from the real thing... Parsons is hyped way beyond his real value anyway. Some good stuff on here, but really not worth the time or money."
2,Strictly Confidential Attraction,"It was a good book. A very quick read. It is something different from the book that are being but out to day. A kinder story, with love, not shooting and cheating."
2,More relevant than ever,"I picked this one out when my Dad took me to a paperback book swap when I was about 12 or 13. I loved it for the science and the way it was constructed, never realizing that it was a respected work that would be reprinted in the future. This is mostly because it does become somewhat ""goofy"" toward the end, but it is necessary to the plot.Every few years the title pops into my head as I watch or read news, so I'm off to buy and enjoy it again. Great fun for any fan of negative utopias and those disturbed by the seemingly random and imprudent recombinant gene experiments so popular for profit motives today."
1,not space efficient,"You have to put the whole cooler in the freezer...Who has room in their freezer/fridge for that? There is room for 2 large bottles, but i think it would be better to just buy a lunch bag and use it with removable freezer packs that take up less space."
1,serious quality problems,"I ordered one of these two months ago, and after playing a couple of DVDs accurately, it began to have very serious problems: the picture would freeze and decompose, the soundtrack would go out of synch. I returned it for a replacement -- and again, after playing 2-3 disks accurately, it has begun to do the same thing. Given the other negative reviews for this product, I imagine this problem (or something like it) is pretty common, not just the occasional lemon. I would not purchase this model unless Panasonic indicates that it has resolved the problem."
1,Did not meet expectations,"I tried this product because I loved the grapefruit body wash from bath and body works but they discontinued it. I thought this would have a nice grapefruit scent, but it just smells exactly like plain dove soap. I really don't see how they can claim it smells like grapefruit when it doesn't at all. I was really disappointed and I will not be buying this product again."
2,Barbie Forever Tawny Horse,"If you want to give the WOW FACTOR to someone, give them this horse. The horse is great and my Grand-daughter was estatic when she saw it, but imagine her excitement when she realized the horse could really walk! Hours of fun, even without the Barbie that is available to ride Tawny. A must for any Barbie lover."
2,Fun when looking for something a little different,"As the title says, this is a great movie when your in the mood for something a little different from the norm. The characters are great and easy to relate to on a 'day to day' basis. Some of the issues presented are not for everyone, but it should not deter you from watching it."
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this wallet is poor. I would not have bought it if I had a chance to touch it before buying. The zipper does not close smoothly; the leather looks just barely leather; it has a bad smell; glue is visible in some places; the finishing is rough. Generally the workmanship is of the lowest quality; I gave it 2 stars as it just might be the best you can get for this price, and because it fits all my cards."
1,Answering recording,The recording quality for the ansering feature is very poor. The sound is fuzzy no matter how close or far away you try to record from the speaker.
1,Uninspired karaoke?,"I am a fan of Vesta's, and I own a few of her other cds. So I expected more: particularly, some creative interpretation of the songs performed as only Vesta can. The selection of songs is great, but they are recorded with virtually no changes except for Vesta replacing the original vocalists. I'd recommend that you wait and buy this used. Relationships is a far stronger cd. I also recommend Christian McBride's Family Affair, as Vesta puts in a strong performance on ""Or So You Thought."""
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Fundamentals","I bought an Aiwa product and experienced very poor quality. The stereo cuts out at higher volumes. Also the CD player is already broken after 2 years. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was attracted to the good sound and even better price, it looks like I got what I paid for. Bad product components from inadequate power supply to poor quality of moving parts even worse customer support. There is no reason a piece of electronics should fail after two years."
1,Decent Album DRM copy protection.,"I just bought this album and it has some great sampling and licks. It has a terrific variance of sounds with great layering. You can tell they had a lot of fun making this album.However, it is DRM encoded, so you cannot copy it to your MP3 player to listen to while you run, or your car's MP3 player to listen to while you drive. Fair use!? Evidently, its not their concern. All I know is (...) the record label is going to tell me how and where to listen to it!? I can understand Lars pulling crap like this, but Mike D!? Free Tibet!? How about FREE MY MUSIC!!!"
2,A Winner from Wouk,"Tracking the life of young Margorie Mornigstar (nee Morgenstern), Wouk traces the conflicts of young love, religion, feminism, and the pace of the changing world in the mid-20th Century."
1,Not up to his standards,I have read and enjoyed most of Baldacci's books. This one was so contrived that the ending was a little tough to get to. So many twists and turns that I think even he got lost.
1,"Beware, this is the Special Edition","That other guy doesn't know what he is talking about. This is not the REAL Star Wars. I mistakenly purchased these videos and found out that they have all the horrible added scenes and Lucas ""special touches"". Do not buy this if you are looking for the untouched version of Star Wars!"
1,Poor quality....broke it within minutes!,"The steamer works that's why it got 2 stars. The attachments are of poor quality and mine broke just as I started doing the floor. I would recommend this for doing tubs, toilets, small things only."
1,Bedtime Reading,"This book is a horrible read. There are some good ideas, but they are hidden by all the charts and results. This was mandatory for Professional Development, or I would have stopped in the first chapter."
1,Could be better!,I wasnt real impressed with the taste of this mix in. It starts out fizzy but that goes away pretty fast. It starts to taste like vitamins more and more. I dont really feel any more energy either. I really dont think it does all it says it does for you. Most likely wont buy again.
1,Not for a Mac,"I have used a Kensington turbo mouse for years, but no more. Kensington has not updated their software to work with Mac OS X 10.7, and the mouse is worthless without it.In addition, my Expert Mouse came with a very stiff and difficult to use trackball, so even if the software had been usable I would have sent it back."
1,Never again,"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality."
2,amazingly different from any sound you've heard before,"I've loved this CD from the moment I bought it and played it for the first time driving in my car. There is just something compelling about Adam Levine's voice and it goes perfectly with the rock beats that are heard throughout this album.i'd say my favourite song would have to be Through With You, although each and every song is great -from the edgy Harder To Breathe, to the balladic She Will Be Loved."
1,Is This Really How the Navajos Did Things?,"I'm sorry folks, but I thought it was boring. I know I fell asleep in the beginning of the afternoon one day while I was reading it. Sure, the facts about the Navajo that the author researched, were researched very well. And I had a sense that the Author was going to let me in on just how much he researched, even if most of what he had to say was very subtle. I can take subtle from an author for just a short time, and then I go and look for a good Romance."
1,These were NOT the correct size.,"Since it's hard for me to find jeans with a 29 inseam in stores (yes, I have short legs), I ordered two pairs of these Levi's 550 size 34x29 about 4 months ago. I love those jeans, because THEY ARE THE RIGHT SIZE. A pair I ordered just recently SAY 34x29 on the patch on the jeans, but they are at least 2 inches longer than my previous purchase. What gives? How hard is it to keep your product the same size? Were they just mislabelled at the factory?I stupidly washed the jeans, figuring maybe the other pairs had just shrunk a little and that these might also. Nope. When I line them up, the new ones are still 2"" longer. Since the whole point of buying these jeans online was to get the correct size, this was a complete waste of money, since I can't return them now.Update: I'm changing my rating to 2 stars because it turns out I will be able to return the jeans, and customer service was very helpful."
2,Suspense will kill you,"I'm not a reader at all really. I'm your average teen playing video games. My mom picked this book to do my book report. This book just keeps leading you on. The suspense is great. It makes you wonder. The book about is about friends you can't trust with money and you are trying to hide the money from the police. They found money in a downed plane, that's all I will say about the book. What would you do. The reason it was not a 5 is because the ending was to fast."
2,Here it is!,"Very well made and attractive enough for company. I'm trying to do my part by buying natural products like bamboo and this set shows you how far ""green"" has come. I don't like salt mills but do you know how hard it is to find a pepper mill with a salt SHAKER? Hard. I know. I looked. Well, here it is!"
2,Very good quality cable,"Received the cable very quickly. Connected to my audio system and noticed the higher fidelity sound at a great price. However, opened up one of the connectors and the wiring was exposed. Better wiring insulation and some shielding should make this a better cable. You won't go wrong purchasing these cables for the low price. Good job Acoustic Research!"
2,"This was the first Mrs. Pollifax book I had ever read, since then I have read several others.",The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax was the first Mrs Pollifax book I ever read. I lent it to my daughter and read another one. My daughter read hers and asked me to get her 8 of Ms.Gillman's books for Christmas. We are both very happy that I did.
2,Great for inspectors with minimal experience,Takes an approach that develops knowledge and understanding for inspectors and engineers with minimal to medium experience. Need to give more emphasis on building construction (small and medium size buildings).
1,CSI was NOT 1.33:1,"This release is not proper. CSI was 16:9 HD from day one. Why, oh why is it not being released in the correct aspect ratio? Beware!"
1,"Bought one, it wouldn't work, got it replaced. which also didn't work.","I was hoping to put together a computer as a christmas present for a friend but BOTH motherboards i got where broken, wouldn't power up at all forcing me to return all the parts I got on amazon because they're useless to me and it will probably cause controversy. Hopefully i get my $155 back without any problems."
1,Eh! Well beyond it's prime now...,"This was a great tool years ago, but Ulead got bought by Corel and now they only offer a full DVD image/video packaged named DVD MovieFactory with much more capabilities.Corel DVD MovieFactory 6.0 Plus"
2,Actual Rating - 4.5 stars. ( They really need to consider a 1/2 star rating system! ),"The second release by this Danish / American power metal band shows the band improving in both the song writing and the song structuring process. Fantastic guitar work woven in with keyboards ( w/ the guitars at the forefront ), a very capable rythm section, and yet another outstanding vocal performance from Lance King make this album a winner. The pieces of this band are really starting to come together on this album and it shows. Fans of melodic power metal, purchase immediately!"
2,"Not a fan of the genre, but this is very well written","I am not a big fan of the Contemporary Fiction - Dysfunctional Family genre of fiction, a genre that sadly dominates American literature. For me, a contemporary work in this genre needs to be exceptional to even crack a 3 rating.The Corrections is one of those exceptions. The genre is so, so tired, but the Corrections is so masterfully written, both on a level of prose and in the realistic construction of the protagonist family, that I have to give it a 4. This book is very well done."
2,What a visual RIDE !,"Bob Bralove has done a killer job of creating yet another wild, wayout visual event.Couldn't believe it when the pig was chasing the donkey, you could hear, and see every single note played.Into ""Aliens Alley"", I felt as though I was just released through the hatch of a space craft without an umbilical cord.All of this DVD is really great, and well worth Amazon's cheap price."
1,It Stinks,"Awful book. Complete rubbish. It holds the readers attention like a monkey's first draft of MacBeth. To think someone out there really thought that the stringing together of these particular words in this particular order for over 100 pages was a worthwhile endeavor, is beyond my comprehension. The EPA is illequiped to safely dispose of this toxic slurry of literary effluvium. This novel should be labeled ""Eye Irritant, in case of contact flush eyes with Shakespeare"" The only nice thing I can say about this book is that the paper might come in handy if you are in the woods after a meal from KFC."
2,honest,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYThe author tries to explain the reasons for Clapton's actions off and on stage, some of which harmed him, others of which harmed others."
1,A real turkey,"Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in ""The Mosquito Coast"" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful. I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well. This film, however, was a huge disappointment. I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting. The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill). Not recommended at all."
2,Comfortable and great support for the price,"The sportaid, hernia truss double I found to be comfortable. It's easy to adjust since it has felcro to adjust around the waist. Make sure you order your waist size and not the hip size. One thing nice about the truss is that you can remove the padding. So whatever side you have the hernia on, you can remove the opposite padding. It's just a matter of getting use to the tightness around the waist area in order to adjust the padding and straps correctly on the hernia to get the proper support. I'd probably go ahead with the surgery to correct the problem than to rely on wearing the belt for the rest of my life."
